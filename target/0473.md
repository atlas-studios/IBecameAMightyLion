Chapter 473: Lion King's New Clothes

"Whoosh\!"

The remaining black shadows quickly retreated like frightened vipers.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and chased after the giant tree above him.

When he came outside the cave at the bottom of the tree, he realized that the black shadow had long disappeared.

The thick tree trunk was empty. No traces were left.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the top of the giant tree and thought of what he had seen and heard on it. He was even more curious and puzzled.

What secrets were hidden on the giant tree?

Why was that vine-like thing only interested in the human girl?

Compared to these monsters, the caves under the trees were not safe.

However, it was also much less troublesome.

At least many ferocious competitors did not even dare to step into the bushes outside.

Although the pterodactyl on the tree was terrifying, they generally did not come down to hunt. The dense vegetation in the bushes made its majestic wings unable to be used, and the cave at the bottom of the tree was a place it did not dare to approach.

The main threat now was the green vine that was like a python.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and returned to the cave at the bottom of the tree. He came in front of the little girl and saw that the green vine he had cut off withered again and turned to dust. He could not chase after it at all.

The little girl was staring with her eyes wide open in a daze.

From bursting into laughter to fright, this was definitely a process that made her reminisce endlessly.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and sized up the human little girl carefully. He smelled the strange fragrance on her again, and it seemed to be even stronger than before.

Her golden hair that was slightly curled like waves grew longer and fell behind her, almost covering her butt. She was even more gentle and elegant than before, like the starlight in the night.

Her appearance was still tender and charming, her skin was white and transparent, and the aura between her brows was no longer the same as before.

Determination and courage, confidence and calm could be seen from her young face and blue eyes.

This was definitely a girl who had changed greatly and was extraordinary.

Why did those python-like green vines keep pestering her? Was it for the strange fragrance on her body, or was it to kidnap her back and melt her as fertilizer?

No matter why, Chu Xiaoye would not let it succeed.

"In the future, sleep with me."

Of course, Chu Xiaoye did not say this, but this human little girl.

She seemed to have also realized the changes in her body and something that was coveting her body. Therefore, she immediately told Chu Xiaoye her request matter-of-factly.

In the past, this request was mercilessly rejected by Chu Xiaoye.

But now, she had plenty of reasons and he could not refuse.

"If Annie is abducted by the monsters, Tibbs will become a pitiful little bear that's as timid as a mouse. In this case, the strength of our pride will be greatly reduced. Furthermore, no one will sing for you anymore. King, what do you think?"

The little girl blinked her beautiful big eyes and said confidently with a faint smile.

She knew that her value to the pride had increased greatly.

Chu Xiaoye still ignored her. After giving her a cold gaze, he turned around and jumped down.

The little girl squatted on it and looked down at him. She suddenly giggled again.

She was not the only one who laughed. Alisa and the Belita sisters, who had come in from outside, also mimicked her voice and laughed. Furthermore, they learned it so vividly that it was very realistic.

The bald lion king was indeed very funny, right?

Chu Xiaoye no longer had his dignity and handsomeness. Although he tried his best to maintain his calm and unconcerned appearance, the wound in his heart could not be healed.

The cave at the bottom of the tree was extremely cold and had just undergone a rainstorm. The humid and cold wind were pervasive and invaded this dark corner wantonly.

Without fur, Chu Xiaoye finally felt cold.

However, he was a lion king, a lion, and the flame that burned in the hearts of all the members. He could not be afraid of the cold.

The word "trembling" could never appear on him.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up again and landed in front of the little girl, walking into the cave.

The outside suddenly became lively. They seemed to be discussing his new hair and clothes enthusiastically.

Even his mother and aunt started to growl gossipingly.

The cold father was even more exaggerated. As soon as he entered, he started to roar with laughter. It seemed that he had been holding it in for a long time.

This old thing\!

Chu Xiaoye walked out of the cave with a cold expression.

The area below that was still lively a second ago immediately quietened down and was silent.

Everyone pretended to be busy with their own things, not daring to look at him guiltily. However, no one knew what they were busy with.

The corner of Little Curly Tail's mouth twitched again. He was clearly holding it in. He must have had a share in the roar just now.

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to teach them a lesson anymore. He was exhausted, dejected, and vexed.

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and ordered them to go out to hunt and patrol the territory immediately.

He had already decided to not go out for this period of time. If other competitors saw him or his neighbors, he would really lose face. If he was mocked by those herbivores before the time came, he would rather die.

"Damn poisonous bees\! One day, This King will make you pay with your blood\!"

Chu Xiaoye returned to the cave and lay on the little girl's furry carpet, sleeping.

"Eh?"

He suddenly turned around and looked down at the carpet on the ground.

It was the fur of a jaguar. It was thick, soft, slender, and beautiful. Furthermore, it was very clean. There was no unpleasant smell anymore, and there was still the strange fragrance of the little girl on it.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. He immediately used a comical action to wear this good fur on his body.

Although there were no zip or buttons, and although his four legs and stomach were leaking, it was very fitting.

His current body was enough to support this leopard skin.

"Wow\! King, so cool\!"

The little girl suddenly walked in from outside and looked at his new appearance. She widened her eyes and praised him sincerely.

It did not seem to be fake.

Chu Xiaoye was a little embarrassed. After all, he had just said that he had deliberately changed his appearance. Now, he could not wait to wear this leopard fur again. Wasn't this slapping his face?

"Go away\!"

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes at her and raised his head and stuck out his chest. He walked around the cave and felt that he could move freely. He was not much different from before and was much better than when he was bare.

Although this jaguar's fur was not as impressive as his lion fur, it was still very beautiful.

After Chu Xiaoye wore this fur, the shy feeling of taking off his clothes and running away was finally gone.

If even a little girl praised him, he must be very handsome.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but walk out of the cave, preparing to show off his disguise again. Anyway, they would see it sooner or later.

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly sounded in his ears\!

Mei Mei pounced over from the side with a fierce expression. Her sharp claws slapped his face fiercely and sent him flying with a bang.

"Brother\! Brother\!"

Then, the female cub let out a roar and ran into the cave in a panic to find her pitiful brother.

The little girl stood stiffly at the entrance of the cave, blinking her big eyes and looking at her in a daze.
