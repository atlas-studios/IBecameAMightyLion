anChapter 512: Sword Competition

On the hill.

The moon was bright and the stars filled the sky.

Chu Xiaoye sat behind the rock and slept while leaning against the wall.

He was indeed tired these few days.

Although he did not run up and down like those elven soldiers, his brainpower was exhausted. Furthermore, because transforming consumed energy, he suddenly felt very tired tonight. He leaned here and unconsciously closed his eyes.

Catherine lay quietly beside him and protected him silently.

Denise also stood beside him, slender and motionless like a sculpture. Her silver waterfall-like hair swayed slightly in the night wind, and her blue eyes were as calm and beautiful as the night sky.

Catherine looked at her coldly.

The little lioness could not understand why this silver-haired fairy wanted to follow her king.

"Is he asleep?"

Princess Annie walked over and asked softly.

Denise nodded slightly.

Catherine raised her head and looked at this former acquaintance unkindly.

Annie seemed to have sensed her emotions. She smiled and squatted in front of her, saying gently, "You like night, right?"

Catherine looked at her coldly and did not respond.

Annie's eyes flickered and she said meaningfully, "Catherine, you have to find yourself first. Night is not just a lion anymore, and it doesn't belong to the grassland. He has a new identity and will definitely have new pursuits. As for you, if you really want to follow him, you can't always be a lion. Do you understand?"

Catherine understood.

However, she only wanted to be a lion, a lion that would always follow behind the king and be unknown, not noticed, and not hated or disliked.

Annie stood up and looked at the tall and charming silver-haired girl in front of her. Her gaze was serious as she said in a tone that could not be refused, "Denise, protect him. The elves can live without me, you, or even Lanisi, but they can't live without him. No matter the price, even if it's your life and soul, you have to protect him, understand?"

The silver-haired girl's calm gaze was suddenly as dazzling as the stars.

She lowered her head slightly, knelt on one knee, and raised the ice-blue jade bow in her hand. She whispered to the moonlight, the elven princess, and her soul and faith. She would use everything she had to protect this young man.

"It's not just protection."

The princess' eyes flickered and she said meaningfully, "We still have to think of a way to make him stay willingly."

Denise got up and lowered her head without hesitation. "Yes."

She understood what the princess meant.

When the Queen let her be the sword attendant of this young man, she already understood.

She would give up everything she had, her soul and body, her honor and dignity, her pride as a elf, her reservedness as a girl, and everything to satisfy him.

She was willing.

The moonlight shone on her almost perfect face and body. The beautiful hair that fell to her legs wrapped around her like a silver veil. She did not look like a mortal girl but like a fairy on the moon.

At this moment, even the Queen, who was standing not far away, looked at her in a daze.

"Do you want to eat?"

The sleeping Chu Xiaoye unconsciously muttered in his sleep and immediately ruined the current atmosphere.

"Eat it yourself."

Princess Annie smiled another Annie smile.

This time, the orc army mobilized and advanced in three directions. They started to build bridges and were very fast.

On the elves' side, because Chu Xiaoye did not tell them about the following plan, they could only watch helplessly opposite. They were anxious and waited in boredom.

Vilis was extremely bored and started to practice her sword on the hill.

She held the sword hilt with both hands, her short skirt swayed, and her silver hair fluttered. Her small and delicate body danced the huge sword in her hand tightly, causing cheers on the hill on both sides.

The cheers woke Chu Xiaoye up.

Chu Xiaoye said loudly in displeasure, "Lady Vilis, I haven't ridden you last night? Come over and let me ride you."

Vilis stopped dancing and stabbed her cold sword into the ground. She looked at him coldly and said angrily, "Pay for the door\!"

These words stunned the others and puzzled them.

Only Princess Annie could not help but laugh.

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to bicker with her. He yawned and stood up. He realized that a shirt had fallen from his body. It was a red robe made of some unknown material. It was as soft as water and emitted a faint fragrance. Even if it fell to the ground, it was not stained with dust.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he bent down to pick it up. Just as he was about to ask, Vilis said coldly, "Return it to me, it belongs to Her Majesty\! I'll bring it to Her Majesty."

Chu Xiaoye tied the robe at his waist, as if he was wearing a red dress. He said angrily, "Since it's Her Majesty's, what has it got to do with you? Why should I return it to you?"

"You…"

Vilis suddenly pulled out the sword on the ground and sneered. "I did not teach you a good lesson last time because of the sword. This time, do you dare to fight me again?"

"No."

Chu Xiaoye admitted defeat. "I'm not an idiot. Since you said that you did not teach me a good lesson last time, you must teach me a good lesson this time. Do I have nothing better to do?"

After saying that, his stomach suddenly growled. He suddenly remembered that he had not eaten for the past few days.

Vilis had nowhere to vent her anger. She said angrily, "Are you a man?"

Chu Xiaoye immediately denied, "No, I'm still a boy."

Vilis choked again and said hatefully, "What do you want to do to compete with me?"

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes and said, "Let me ride it again."

Just as Vilis was about to flare up, she immediately thought of something and thought to herself, "This isn't a bet like last time. Even if I give in to him, he won't win. What am I afraid of?"

"Alright\!"

At the thought of this, she immediately agreed. She was secretly delighted and said seriously, "As long as you can take three, no, ten strikes from me, I'll agree to you. How about that?"

Annie, who was walking over from afar, heard their conversation and smiled bitterly. Why did this Vilis always like to ask for trouble and humiliate herself?

Although her swordsmanship was indeed very high, as long as that fellow dared to bet, there was nothing he could not win.

Princess Annie believed in this—be it the former Annie or the current Annie.

"Then you can't hurt me. It's against the rules to hurt me."

Chu Xiaoye pretended to hesitate for a while before saying timidly.

Vilis was overjoyed, but she revealed a fake smile and said, "Of course not. You still have to help us elves fight orcs. I will never hurt you."

"Clang\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately pulled out Broken Soul and said, "Lady Vilis, for the sake of fairness, please let me attack five more times."

Vilis' expression changed slightly. Thinking that this fellow's strength was astonishing, her arms would be numb after five strikes and she could not take it. She immediately said, "No\! At most three strikes\!"

Chu Xiaoye pretended to hesitate and thought for a moment before reluctantly agreeing. "Alright, then you must not hurt me."

"Yes, of course\!"

Vilis looked certain, but she was snickering in her heart. Idiot\! Idiot\! I, Lady Vilis, have said that I won't hurt you, but I never said that I won't beat or humiliate you\! As long as you don't have any wounds on your body, you're not injured\! Hehehehe…

Annie, who had walked close, rubbed her forehead and could not bear to watch.
