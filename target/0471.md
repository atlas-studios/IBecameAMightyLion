Chapter 471: The Furious Pterodactyl\!

Damn bandits\!

The golden mane on Chu Xiaoye's neck was quickly plucked clean by the poisonous bee army.

The young, handsome, and majestic golden-haired lion king had actually turned into an ugly old man with a bald neck and head.

In terms of appearance and life, he chose the latter without hesitation.

The poisonous bee army left satisfied with their spoils of war.

Chu Xiaoye stood stiffly on the branch, messy and sad in the morning wind.

However, now was not the time to be sad.

He believed that his mighty and handsome golden mane was like withered grass that had been burned by a wild fire. When the spring wind blew, it would break out of the ground again and be full of life\!

The huge beehives blocked the branches in front of them. The poisonous bee army was using the golden mane they had snatched to decorate their nests meticulously. They looked excited and pleased.

The ear-piercing buzzes seemed to be mocking the young lion king with the baldy's neck in front of him.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and landed on the branch above him, continuing to walk forward.

When he carefully passed by the huge beehive, he could not help but look down. The huge grayish-brown beehive was shining with golden light under the sun, as if it was plated with a layer of gold.

He never knew how beautiful these golden strands of fur were on his neck. It was ironic that he could see them in this way.

Chu Xiaoye mocked himself in his heart. He did not stay and immediately walked forward.

The buzzing of the poisonous bees was left behind. The ear-piercing laughter and the frustration and anger of being robbed were also forgotten. He walked forward and looked warily at the main trunk of the giant tree in front of him.

The leaves there were even lusher.

The branches were like the tentacles of a monster, twisting and winding. On the thick branches, they built hollow balls that looked like a nest. Under the dense leaves, one could only vaguely see some things inside.

There was fur inside, like the fur of an animal or the feathers of a bird.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down, held his breath, and approached carefully.

When he walked close, he used his head and claws to push aside the dense leaves blocking the front and looked at one of the balls.

Mottled light landed on it with the sway of the leaves. Chu Xiaoye clearly saw a dark tail and a strange animal that looked like a lizard. No, not one, but many.

Furthermore, they seemed to have wings on their backs.

Chu Xiaoye's heart raced. He widened his eyes and took a few steps forward again to look.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, an ear-piercing scream suddenly came from the sky not far away\!

It was like a sharp bird's cry or the roar of a wild beast. Its voice was strange and hoarse, but it was filled with a smell that made his blood run cold. It sounded very angry and anxious\!

Their mother or father should have returned.

To be honest, although Chu Xiaoye was very curious about these strange little animals, he had no intention of hurting them.

He hoped that their parents would understand.

However, when Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the sky, he immediately understood that their parents would never understand or let him go.

It was a green pterodactyl more than five meters long with a huge pair of wings, a thick tail, and a ferocious face\!

The pterodactyl's eyes were cold and dark green. It bared its sharp fangs and looked flustered, exasperated, and murderous. It was extremely angry and hateful.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and turned to run.

However, he knew clearly that no matter how fast he was, he could not be faster than this pterodactyl with huge wings. Furthermore, he was on a tree.

Perhaps he, who had evolved until now, could still fight this terrifying pterodactyl. However, he was certain that there was definitely more than one such pterodactyl here.

The huge pterodactyl nests on the branch already explained everything.

On the lowest branch of this super huge tree, there were no sparrows, birds, or nests. There was only a group of ancient winged dragons that built nests and lived here\!

What a shocking and excited discovery.

But now, Chu Xiaoye's first priority was to save his life.

He could not run away and jumping off the tree was even more improbable. Not to mention that he would fall to his death if he was not prepared, the pterosaur had already flapped its wings and rushed over. It was extremely fast. He did not doubt that when he jumped down, his head would be pierced by the other party's claws before he could land halfway. Then, he would bring it back to the nest to continue looking at the little pterosaurs and become their breakfast.

Without thinking much, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped lightly and landed on the branch below.

Although his actions were very light, they still alarmed the poisonous bee army that was proudly admiring their golden nest.

"Buzz…"

The poisonous bee army swarmed over, looking fierce and murderous.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the branch and held his breath. He did not move and treated himself as a part of the tree again.

"You can't see me… You can't see me… I'm a tree… I'm a branch… I'm a leaf… I'm a fruit…"

Unfortunately, this time, the poisonous bee army was not so easy to fool.

They bared their mutated sharp fangs and the sharp thorns on their tails and decided to kill\!

"Boom —"

Right at this moment, a huge air wave suddenly attacked\!

The branches swayed and the leaves rustled. The furious green pterodactyl swooped down, opened its bloody mouth full of fangs, and bit fiercely at Chu Xiaoye's… golden mane\!

Not only did the golden mane carry Chu Xiaoye's scent, there were also traces of blood from plucking the fur.

Furthermore, the golden mane was enhanced with a huge beehive, making it look very majestic and conspicuous.

The green pterodactyl protected its young deeply and was exceptionally furious. It started to bite crazily at the bodies under the golden manes—or rather, the beehives. At the same time, it extended its sharp claws and started to tear ferociously, wanting to tear this thief that was coveting its young into pieces\!

The pitiful huge beehive was instantly torn to pieces and fluttered like cotton.

The young bees shivered inside and the female peak king cried out in despair.

The poisonous bee army that was about to attack Chu Xiaoye was shocked and furious when they saw this scene. They flew into a rage and turned around. Like a tide, they rushed over in a black mass, roaring angrily and cursing.

The poisonous bee army was instantly covered in the green pterodactyl's body and bit and stung crazily\!

The green pterodactyl was even more furious. It continued to bite the huge beehive wrapped in the golden mane. Soon, it tore open the beehive completely. The young bees, queen bees, and the food the poisonous bee army had painstakingly brought back fell like snow.

The poisonous bee army collapsed and went crazy. They did not want to live anymore\!

"Kill—"

This neighbor, who had lived in peace for more than a hundred years, started to risk his life.

Chu Xiaoye, who was lying on the branch and did not dare to move, came to a great conclusion—short-sightedness required glasses\!
