Chapter 370: Untitled

"Eat it\!"

Chu Xiaoye growled with a fierce expression and continued to threaten.

The little girl bit her lips, her eyes watery. She shook her head pitifully, her little face filled with begging. "No… please, don't…"

She had just eaten her fill and had just played with this little monkey.

She had personally witnessed the little monkey being killed, dismembered, and eaten. Then, she had dismembered such a small piece and placed it in front of her, just like the piece of meat she had eaten previously.

She felt terrified and even closed her eyes, not daring to look again.

Why did he do this to her?

Her entire body was trembling. She originally thought that the young king in front of her would continue to roar and threaten her to eat this little monkey meat, but she suddenly quietened down.

When she opened her eyes, the young king had already left.

Only the piece of meat and the little monkey's bloody corpse were still left on the grass.

The surroundings were quiet and empty.

The little girl suddenly felt very afraid. She hurriedly turned around, picked up her dress, and ran towards the pride's camp.

She thought that the young king was angry and ignored her.

If the pride left and he left, what should she do?

When she ran to the pride's camp, she saw that they were busy. The young king was building a super big thing that looked like a bird's nest on the tree. He looked very proficient.

The little girl stood in place, looking up with tears in her eyes.

Due to the help of Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine, Chu Xiaoye built very quickly. In a day and night, he had already built the outermost outline.

However, if he wanted to build this hut on the tree, he still needed many things.

Thick and flexible branches, big bushes, and many animal fur and animal tendons.

There were branches and bushes in this forest. As for animal fur and animal tendons, they needed to continue hunting.

Chu Xiaoye decided to hunt a few water buffaloes personally at night.

The water buffalo's tendons were extremely tough and thick. They could be used to fix branches.

Now, these water buffaloes were mutated water buffaloes. They were huge and the bull tendons and cowhide on them were of superior quality. They were very suitable.

Of course, the beef on them was also very delicious. If they were used to cut or cut into grains and made into beef jerky and beef jerky, they should taste very delicious.

Time passed quickly when they were busy.

In the blink of an eye, the sky turned dark.

When Chu Xiaoye came down from the tree, the little girl was waiting for him quietly under the tree at the side. Seeing him come down, the little girl hurriedly stood up and blinked her big eyes at him.

For humans, night meant that they had to sleep.

The temperature was very low at night here. The little girl was wearing a dress and felt cold during the day, let alone at night.

The little girl had snuggled in his arms last night and relied on his furry fur to resist the cold, so tonight…

The little girl cowered and looked at him eagerly.

However, Chu Xiaoye only looked at her once before leaving with Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, and Molly.

He planned to hunt tonight.

The strange thing was that Tilly, who originally liked noise, was still lying on the tree and did not come down. She only opened her eyes and looked at them lazily, then closed her eyes to sleep.

Chu Xiaoye was a little puzzled. Could it be that the female cub was sick?

Logically speaking, with her physique, she could not be sick. Furthermore, she looked like she was only sleeping and did not want to move. She did not look sick.

Forget it, let's not care about her.

Chu Xiaoye left with the team.

The little girl opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but she did not say anything. She ran out of the bushes with the team and watched as their backs gradually disappeared into the distance, her eyes filled with sadness.

"Indeed, the bad king is angry."

The little girl pouted, her face filled with grievance.

She left alone and returned to the dense bushes. She curled up and lay down.

The ground was still a little damp and the cold wind blew in through the gaps in the bushes.

The little girl trembled and curled up.

In a daze, she finally closed her eyes and fell asleep.

In her dream, she stood on the cliff, covered in snow and ice. The cold wind was biting, causing her golden hair to fly and her white dress to flutter. She was so cold that she shivered and was almost frozen.

When she woke up, the sun shone through the gaps in the bushes.

A warm body suddenly appeared beside him. Her face was also buried in the thick mane and her arms were hugging him tightly.

At some point in time, this bad king had already returned and was quietly lying beside her, providing her with warmth.

The little girl raised her face and looked at him with her eyes wide open, her eyes filled with bright surprise.

She buried her head in his mane and rubbed her forehead in it gently. Her little face was filled with attachment. Just as she was about to close her eyes and continue sleeping, Chu Xiaoye suddenly stood up and pushed her away with his claws. His actions were rough. Then, he crawled out of the bushes and left quickly.

The little girl fell to the ground and pouted. She looked at his back faintly and whispered, "Bastard."

When the sun rose, Chu Xiaoye and his friends started to get busy again.

He had hunted three giant water buffaloes last night and was still lying in the grass.

These three water buffaloes were enough for the members of the pride of the cold father to enjoy. The sisters and the six female lions could also share one.

As for Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers, they were all hunting experts. They could eat anywhere outside and would basically not return to eat their food.

Before dividing the three giant water buffaloes, Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Mei Mei, and peeled off the water buffalo completely with his sharp claws. He also carefully pulled out the beef tendon in the water buffalo's body.

Little Curly Tail was too rough and impatient. After he volunteered to break a tendon, he was slapped away by Chu Xiaoye and continued to pick the branches gloomily.

When the little girl came over, she saw them dripping with blood as they smoked beef tendons, looking ferocious.

The little girl was not afraid of water buffaloes. Furthermore, she missed the fresh steak on them. However, it was clearly not time to eat yet.

She saw that everyone was busy and wanted to find something to do. She happened to see Little Curly Tail biting the branch angrily and immediately ran over to help.

Little Curly Tail's sharp teeth could quickly bite off the branches and his tail could be transported very well. However, it was troublesome to arrange them together.

With the little girl's help, his speed was much faster.

Little Curly Tail was feeling wronged. Although he saw this strange little thing taking the initiative to help, he did not look at her kindly. He even bared his fangs to scare her sometimes.

This little thing had snatched his brother's love\!

However, the little girl was no longer as afraid of him as she was at the beginning.

Because the little girl realized that this young lion with a long tail was very afraid of his brother. His brother would not let him bully her.

After Chu Xiaoye peeled the cow's skin and smoked the beef tendon, he called for everyone to enjoy the fresh meal.

When the little girl was hesitating not far away, Chu Xiaoye looked at her, raised his claws, and hooked them at her, as if he was saying, "Little girl, come and eat. It's fresh steak."

Seeing that he had taken the initiative to call her, the little girl immediately smiled sweetly. She took out a small knife from her waist and ran over.

She had to cut more beef to preserve it today, or she would starve again.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at Tilly on the tree and hesitated for a moment. Then, he used his claws to cut off a cow leg, put it in his mouth, and climbed up the tree.

"Hey, it's time to eat\!"

Chu Xiaoye patted her head with his claws and woke her up.

Tilly slowly opened her eyes and looked at him sleepily. She slowly closed them again, and her eyelids seemed to be so heavy that it was difficult to open.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes revealed a hint of confusion. That shouldn't be the case. No matter how tired and sleepy she was, she should not have such a slow reaction and addiction to sleep.

This was not a state a lion should be in.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and slapped her a few more times, increasing his strength.

Tilly opened her eyes again and looked at him. She moaned a few times and closed her eyes again.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that his claws were covered in a few strands of snow-white fur.

He was stunned for a moment before stretching out his claws and touching her head tentatively.

In the end, he touched a large amount of snow-white fur.

Hair loss? Balding?

Chu Xiaoye looked at the little white lion in front of him in shock, the corner of his mouth twitching.

Wasn't this a characteristic only middle-aged men had?

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a while before he suddenly extended his claws and touched her butt. In the end, he touched a few more strands of fur.

"Roar—"

Tilly suddenly trembled and raised her tail. She bared her fangs and roared, glaring at him fiercely.

"Who asked you to touch my butt\!"

Then, she lay back down and closed her eyes.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he extended his claws and touched it carefully.

This time, Tilly did not open her eyes or roar again. Instead, she snorted from her nose, as if she was saying, "Touch it, touch it. Anyway, I won't lose a strand of fur."

Chu Xiaoye looked at his claws. They were covered in fur again.
