Chapter 425: Untitled

The rain continued for the night.

After dawn, there were still no signs of stopping.

The already soft and damp ground became even more muddy and difficult to walk on.

However, no matter how difficult it was to walk, he had to walk.

Chu Xiaoye would not be at ease until he found a new territory.

The pride advanced in the rain and stepped on the path full of mud and water pits. They walked very slowly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the majestic mountain in front of him and prayed secretly. He hoped that this time, crossing the mountains would be the last time.

He was tired of this endless path with mountains outside and rivers.

Poor Belia worked hard last night and did not get any response. Now, she was dispirited and walked with difficulty. She did not have the energy to pester Chu Xiaoye anymore.

However, she clearly would not give up.

"Roar…"

At this moment, a miserable and weak cry suddenly came from the forest in front of him.

From the sound, it was like a lion and seemed to be injured.

Chu Xiaoye paused for a moment and immediately walked over with the pride.

To be able to encounter their own kind here, be it passersby or competitors, was something worth looking at.

It was a young lion. It was not much older than Chu Xiaoye and was at most a year older. However, the mane on its neck had already turned black. Furthermore, it was extremely tall and almost caught up to Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur.

At this moment, this young and tall lion was lying on the ground moaning. One of its front legs was broken and its body was riddled with wounds and covered in blood.

On the ground around him, there were seven to eight spotted hyenas that were already dead.

When this young and tall lion saw Chu Xiaoye walking over with the pride, it immediately stopped roaring and bared its fangs. Its gaze was fierce and vigilant. It stood up from the ground with difficulty, looking like it could continue fighting at any time.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and walked in front of it. He looked at the corpses of the hyenas on the ground and looked at it again.

"Roar—"

The young and tall lion did not show any weakness and roared as they looked at each other.

"Bam\!"

Unexpectedly, just as it roared, a tail like an iron whip suddenly flew over and slapped its mouth heavily. Immediately, his skin and flesh were lacerated and his mouth was filled with blood.

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and walked in front of him. He looked askance at him, looking like a rascal.

The young and tall lion was furious. It roared angrily and widened its eyes in anger. Its muscles were tense and it prepared to pounce.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him heavily on the head, causing him to tilt his head and fall to the ground.

The two brothers slapped the unfamiliar young lion silly with their tails and claws.

Just as Little Curly Tail swung his tail and was about to continue beating him, the cold father suddenly walked out of the crowd and blocked him. He looked at him with a dignified and brave gaze, telling him to stop.

The cold father's unprecedented move stunned Little Curly Tail.

Chu Xiaoye was also surprised. Could this unfamiliar lion be another son the cold father had made outside back then?

The cold father looked at the two unfilial sons mockingly and shook the mane on his neck. He turned around and circled the unfamiliar lion to express his intentions.

"Now is the time to use lions. In the future, to occupy new territory, expand our borders, and fight for territory, we need lion talents. Not only is this unfamiliar lion young and strong, it is also tall and brave. If we let it submit to the pride, it will definitely be a great help to the pride\!"

Alright, Chu Xiaoye had to admit that his father was not as stupid as he thought.

Although he was still very stupid.

Little Curly Tail immediately understood what his father meant. He thought for a moment and put away his tail.

As long as it was beneficial to his brother's future grand ambitions, he would definitely support it. However, this lion's front leg was already broken. Could it be healed?

To Chu Xiaoye's surprise, Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, and even the Chino brothers walked over and expressed their thoughts like the cold father.

They were all sincerely thinking about this pride.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye started to hesitate. If he did not accept this unfamiliar lion, everyone would think that he was narrow-minded and could not tolerate other talents.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Mei Mei and Molly, asking for their opinions.

Mei Mei seemed to hesitate for a moment before shaking her head, clearly indicating that she did not like the addition of this lion.

Just as Molly was hesitating on how to express it, she suddenly saw Little Curly Tail's slanted gaze. She immediately shook her head with Mei Mei to show that she had the same opinion as Mei Mei.

At this moment, the Jiela sisters walked over with the six female lions.

Since they were all members of the pride, Chu Xiaoye naturally had to ask for their opinions.

The Jiela sisters expressed that they did not care.

As for the six female lions, they were a little hesitant, as if they were afraid that if they added a lion, the number of prey they caught every time would increase.

This unfamiliar lion was so strong. Its appetite would naturally be huge.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Xi'er, Maya, and his mother.

The three female lions had the same opinion as the cold father and agreed with the addition of this unfamiliar lion. Their pride needed to frequently replenish their fresh blood in order to continue passing it down.

Alright, it seemed that most people hoped for this unfamiliar lion to join.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry to make a decision.

He looked at the leopard family of four.

The Blue couple expressed that it did not matter. Belita did not express anything, and Belia curled her lips in disdain, indicating that she hated fellows with black manes.

"Furthermore, although this fellow looks big, he's so useless."

Under Chu Xiaoye's gaze, Belia twisted her slender waist provocatively and expressed her opinion with a watery gaze.

Chu Xiaoye swore that he had not thought wrongly. What the little female leopard meant was that although this unfamiliar lion looked tall and strong, it was actually not that strong. A few spotted hyenas could bite it like this.

Chu Xiaoye looked elsewhere, wanting to see if any other member had any objections.

The little girl riding the big black bear suddenly raised her small hands and said loudly, "King, Annie also has objections. This lion is so pitiful. Why don't we take him in first? When we encounter the enemy on the way, let him charge through the enemy lines. When we're hungry, we can even eat him."

"..."

Chu Xiaoye looked at this innocent little animal and secretly sighed at the influence of the environment.

The reason why the little girl dared to speak so loudly was naturally because she knew that other than a certain bad fellow who knew how to pretend that he did not understand, no one else could understand her.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and looked at the unfamiliar lion in front of him again.

When they were discussing whether to leave this lion behind, it did not seem to be doing anything else. Instead, it stood there and waited very patiently.

He seemed to have waited for a long time.
