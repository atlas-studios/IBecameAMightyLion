Chapter 394: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped down hurriedly and bit the tail of the gazelle coat behind her. He swung his claws and grabbed the tree trunk at the side, hanging the little girl in midair.

The little girl was only half a meter away from the ground\!

If he was a step slower, she would fall and her head would bleed. She might even die\!

Chu Xiaoye loosened his teeth and threw the little girl on the grass. He looked up and saw that the attacker had long gone, leaving only an agile back.

Then, he disappeared into the dark night.

Although the other party was sent flying by him, he did not fall to the ground. Instead, he landed on a big tree at the back. Then, using the big tree as a springboard, he jumped up and down a few times and fled this place.

His movement technique, which was like walking on flat ground between the trees, was as agile as a raccoon. He did not look like a huge ferocious tiger.

However, Chu Xiaoye could see clearly that the attacker was the tiger.

The reason why the tiger could come close without anyone noticing was probably because it jumped down from the tree directly. At the same time, it used the wild rabbit to attract attention and hide the sound.

This intelligence was not something an ordinary beast could have.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and landed on the ground. He looked at the frightened little girl on the grass and also had lingering fear.

If he had discovered it a second later, this little girl would have died.

But now, it seemed that this little human girl was really a burden to him.

The little girl sat on the grass with a pale face and looked at him pitifully. She was clearly frightened and seemed to want to be comforted.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and glanced at her coldly before walking past her.

The injured wild rabbit became Qiqi and Nunu's plaything. With no success in escaping, it started to fall to the ground and pretend to be dead. It did not move, but the two little fellows were still interested in playing.

Not all the members had seen the scene on the tree just now.

The tiger came silently and walked as fast as the wind. Many members did not even see its shadow, but were shocked by Chu Xiaoye's roar and fierce movements.

Chu Xiaoye knew that the tiger could not tolerate it anymore and could not wait.

If the pride stayed here for one more day, the tiger would have one more day of anger and one less day of patience.

There was no need to chase. He would naturally come again. It would not be long.

Next time, Chu Xiaoye would never let the other party escape again\!

Callie's corpse and soul were still waiting for him here.

Chu Xiaoye walked around the pride's camp and checked the traps that were covered by the fallen leaves. He then looked up at the tree.

As long as everyone gathered and did not run around, the tiger would have no chance.

"King…"

At this moment, the little girl suddenly shouted at him softly. Her face was slightly red and she seemed to be a little embarrassed. She whispered, "I… I want to pee."

She must have been frightened.

Chu Xiaoye was a little speechless.

After all, she was a human and had yet to forget the sense of shame of humans.

Couldn't she squat there and pee?

Other than yourself, who could understand your strange body structure when walking upright?

If they did not know your original appearance, everyone would have thought that you were a mutated gazelle\!

Look at your close-fitting gazelle skin, look at your little tail behind you, and look at your watery eyes. Other than your golden hair, aren't you a living gazelle?

Was there a difference?

In the eyes of lions, the current you was not much different from a little gazelle.

Therefore, what was there to avoid? What was there to be shy about?

Chu Xiaoye walked to her side and gestured for her to settle it here. There was no need to hide. There was nothing to hide and no one would peep or laugh.

The little girl's face was red. She hesitated for a moment and extended her finger to poke his forehead. She said shyly, "You… turn around."

Damn\!

Do you think I'm a gangster?

I'm a dignified lion king, a majestic and domineering lion king. The reason I'm standing here is to protect you and watch over you. I'm preventing other ruffians from peeping at you, understand?

What do you mean?

Do you know that you are insulting This King?

Chu Xiaoye was very angry and felt deeply insulted.

The little girl ignored his anger and took a few steps back. She hid behind the tree and stuck her head out. She blinked her big eyes at him, as if she was looking at a peeping Tom.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He snorted coldly in his heart and turned around, but he pricked up his ears.

That tiger might not let the matter rest tonight. It might suddenly turn around. That situation was not impossible.

"Ah\!"

Right at this moment, the little girl suddenly let out a scream.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He jumped over with a whoosh and raised his sharp golden claws high, but with a whoosh, he could only grab the grass helplessly.

The little girl fell to the ground and one of her feet fell into the trap dug by Pit. She widened her eyes in fear and was at a loss.

The other members of the pride quickly surrounded him, bared their fangs, and prepared to fight.

However, there was no sign of the tiger anywhere, nor were there any signs of other enemies. Only the little girl sat on the ground with her head lowered in shame.

"Sorry…"

The little girl apologized with tears in her eyes. She was not frightened or in pain. She felt that she was useless and that she was always a burden to the pride.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and rubbed her head a few times, then her back. His gaze was gentle, as if he was comforting her.

"It's okay."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the pride and let everyone disperse to continue resting.

As for him, he climbed up the tree calmly.

The little girl's eyes were filled with tears as she stared blankly at his figure, her heart filled with warmth.

"The king is so good… In the future, I will never call the king a baddie again."

The little girl thought warmly, but she suddenly realized that her hair seemed to be wet.

She was stunned for a moment before she immediately raised her arm and rubbed her head with her small hand. Indeed, she touched something damp on it.

She placed her little hand under her nose and smelled it, her eyes filled with confusion.

Suddenly, she seemed to have thought of something and reached out to touch her back. Hence, she touched something damp again.

She looked blankly at the grass in front of her.

Then, she suddenly raised her head and looked at the figure on the tree.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was rubbing his feet hard on a branch with a furious expression. He whimpered, as if he was cursing.

"Bad luck\! Bad luck\!"

The invincible golden claw actually caught pee\!

Damn it\!

The little girl immediately clenched her two small fists and angrily overturned her warm thought from just now. She said word by word, "Bad\! Egg\! King\!
