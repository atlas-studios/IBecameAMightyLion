Chapter 259: Courtship

 "Bam\!"

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

Little Curly Tail's tail was like an iron whip as he vented crazily on the legs of the water buffaloes. The slaps made the water buffaloes kneel on the ground and roll down.

Until the sky turned dark, the rash water buffaloes still could not rush up.

At this moment, the water buffalo leader realized something and called out. He brought the herd and walked towards another upward path downstream exhausted.

Just as Little Curly Tail was about to chase after him to stop him, he was called back by Chu Xiaoye.

The water buffaloes were already exhausted. Even if they all rushed up, they would not be able to deal with them for the time being.

The other members of the pride were still hungry and had to bring back the remaining prey.

Of the four water buffaloes, only one and a half were left.

Catherine dragged the half head and the other end was dragged by blue eyes and mixed fur.

The six strong lions expressed their shock at Catherine's strength with their wide eyes.

Little Curly Tail followed behind Catherine and ate as he walked.

When he returned to the camp, he was almost full.

The female lions were extremely happy to see them bring back such a sumptuous prey. They hurriedly surrounded them and started to eat.

The two young cubs, Nunu and Qiqi, also crawled out of the cave and followed behind Maya, eating with relish.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the wounds on the female lions one by one. Seeing that there were no signs of pus infection, he relaxed.

At this moment.

The cold father's growl suddenly came from the grass beside him.

As the king of the pride, he had yet to eat. How could these female lions and young cubs not know the rules?

If not for the fact that there were guests, he would have gone up to teach them a lesson long ago\!

The cold father walked over angrily from the grass, pushed Callie away, and lay down to start eating.

As for Aisha and Xi'er, even if the Chu Xiaoye brothers and Mei Mei were not around, he did not dare to provoke them.

These two female lions were fierce.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw his brother, Lars, lying there. He did not come over, as if he was waiting for everyone to eat first.

He was clearly feeling inferior now.

Chu Xiaoye did not persuade him. There was more food today and he would definitely have a share.

The lost confidence and dominance could not be picked up in a day or two. He had to take it slow.

Where was the little white lion?

He had followed her all the way from the snow mountain. If she starved to death, her brother would never let him go.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes and looked around, but he did not see the white figure.

When he walked to the orchard, Belita's roar suddenly came from above.

"Big fart, come quickly. Your cub has fainted\! Get her down\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the little white lion was lying limp on a branch with its eyes closed and not moving. It looked like it had really fainted.

At this moment, the grass beside him moved. Belia twisted her slender waist and butt full of patterns and walked out. She looked at him with watery eyes and let out a spring-like roar.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped a small tree at the side\!

With a crack, the small tree broke and fell.

He looked coldly at the little leopard in heat and shook his claws.

Belia was shocked and immediately jumped onto the tree beside her. She roared at him with a resentful expression, as if she was saying, "Rascal\! Rough\! Unromantic\! Not a man\!"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and quickly climbed up the tree to arrive in front of the little white lion.

Catherine stood not far away and looked at him in a daze. She thought to herself, Brother Ye is indeed not fully developed and is not tempted at all.

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and patted the little white lion's head. Seeing that there was no reaction, he immediately raised his claws and slapped her face.

Tilly's body trembled and she slowly opened her eyes. She was stunned for a few seconds before she suddenly looked at Belita. With a whoosh, she jumped down from the tree and fled.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and looked at her back in a daze, feeling puzzled.

The female cub was strong and fearless. Why was it that when she saw this little leopard, she was like a mouse that saw a cat?

Was this little leopard that terrifying?

Chu Xiaoye raised his head in confusion and looked at the little leopard.

Belita blinked her big eyes and looked at him innocently, indicating that she did not do anything.

Chu Xiaoye stared at her for a while before suddenly climbing up and riding on her. He let out a low growl and deliberately frightened her, making her his mount in the future. Otherwise, he would bite her to death\!

"Wu…"

Belita lay on the branch and did not dare to move. She let out a pitiful whimper and asked Belia, who was on another tree, for help.

"Sister, save me…"

Belia's eyes immediately lit up in excitement. Without a word, she jumped over without hesitation and landed on a branch at the side. She took the initiative to lie down and looked at Chu Xiaoye with watery eyes. She bared her teeth and roared angrily, "You bastard\! Quickly get down from my sister\! Come and ride me if you have the ability\! Come\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with this little fellow in heat. He slapped her face, climbed down the tree, and left.

"Roar —"

Seeing that he had walked far away, Belita dared to bare her fangs and glare angrily. At the same time, she shook the fur on her body, afraid that the big smelly fart would put the stench on her flowery clothes.

Beside him, Belia's face was filled with jealousy and anger. Compared to her eager appearance just now, she was like a different leopard.

When Chu Xiaoye returned to the camp, he saw the little white lion lying beside his mother, eating its prey slowly and elegantly, looking obedient and reserved.

His mother even licked her fur very gently.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. Just as he was about to go over and make the little white lion stay away from his mother, Mei Mei suddenly walked over from the side and rubbed his head. She looked at the little white lion with an envious expression and asked.

"Brother, is this beautiful sister your spoils of war?"

Just as Chu Xiaoye did not know how to answer, Little Curly Tail suddenly crawled out from the bushes at the side and looked at Mei Mei with a mocking expression.

"Idiot\! This is clearly brother's harem\!"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him down\!

He had yet to grow his mane and already thought of a harem. This kid was too mature\!

Little Curly Tail lay on the ground with his claws covering his head and a wronged expression.

The water buffalo that he brought back was quickly eaten by the pride.

After eating and drinking his fill, he naturally continued to sleep.

For lions, other than eating, sleeping was the happiest thing.

The wounds on Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei's bodies healed very quickly. They no longer felt any pain. As for the other members’ wounds, they would take at least another two days to heal.

Therefore, they could only set off two days later.

Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry as long as everyone was fine.

The sun set.

The sky soon turned dark.

The territory here was about to become a thing of the past. Therefore, there was no need to patrol.

Chu Xiaoye slept for a day. At this moment, he was full of energy and did not feel sleepy.

After everyone fell asleep, he crawled into the bushes and prepared to practice jumping among the trees like every night in the past.

The few battles proved that this practice was very useful.

To any creature, strength was like sailing against the current. If they did not advance, they would retreat.

The world was changing every moment. Now, all sorts of animals and plants had mutated and become stronger.

If he was stronger and never stopped practicing, he would soon be caught up by other animals.

If he wanted to go to the grassland and open up a new territory and home, and protect his family, he had to make himself stronger.

At least, he was not afraid of any threat.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes and immediately climbed up the tree, starting to jump.

Catherine followed behind him silently like his shadow and did not fall behind at all.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at the little lioness's deep eyes and could not help but raise his claws to stroke her head, signaling that there was no need to work so hard. As long as he protected her.

Catherine lowered her head. Under the bright moonlight, she was actually as docile and shy as a girl, causing a ripple in Chu Xiaoye's heart.

"Roar\!"

A roar suddenly came from the side.

A white figure suddenly jumped over and landed beside them, squeezing in the middle.

Tilly looked provocatively at Chu Xiaoye and issued a challenge. "Do you want to compete again and see who can jump faster and further?"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to feed her farts, the Belita sisters’ roars suddenly came from the forest in front of him.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly jumped over.

Catherine and Tilly followed closely.

When Chu Xiaoye came to this forest, he realized that on the big tree where the Belita sisters were squatting, a tall and dark-skinned young black leopard was climbing up and approaching the sisters step by step.

This black leopard did not have any hostility. Instead, it looked at the Belita sisters with a burning gaze. Its tail swayed gently and it let out a low growl, as if it was begging for a mate.

As for the Belita sisters, they lowered their heads, bared their teeth, and roared angrily. Their eyes were filled with disgust and anger, and they did not seem to be charmed by his strong body at all.

When Chu Xiaoye jumped over with Catherine and Tilly, this strong black leopard suddenly turned around and looked at them coldly and warningly. He told them to scram and not disturb his sister\!

Even when he saw that these three were lions, he was not afraid at all. His gaze was still strong, and he bared his fangs in an extremely arrogant manner.

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye heard movement in the grass under the tree.

He looked down and saw a group of black leopards jumping and weaving in the grass like ghosts in the night, quickly surrounding their big tree.
