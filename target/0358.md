Chapter 358: Untitled

"Roar—"

Right on the heels of that, Little Curly Tail immediately roared and turned his head to glare at Molly, who was behind him. He looked at her fiercely and disdainfully, as if the two farts just now were released by this female cub.

The way to resolve the embarrassment was to make others feel embarrassed.

However, it was obvious that Molly did not fall for his trick and would not yield to him. She also slanted her eyes at him and curled her mouth, looking disdainful.

As for everyone, their gazes did not turn to Molly and they were still looking at him.

Little Curly Tail could only turn around and glare at the cold father.

The cold father did not want to be outdone and also glared at him.

The father and son stared at each other fiercely, not giving in to each other.

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and walked over. He bared his fangs at his father, preparing to scare him, make him show his fear, and help attract his attention.

Just as the cold father braced himself and was about to accept the slap of this unfilial son, Chu Xiaoye slapped Little Curly Tail's head and let out a low growl to make him behave.

Little Curly Tail immediately drooped his tail and the ominous glint in his eyes disappeared. He lowered his head and returned to his original position obediently.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

Little Curly Tail followed behind him eagerly. He quickly forgot the embarrassment just now and was attracted by the prosperous scene of this new world. He was so excited that he could not close his mouth.

The cold father finally heaved a sigh of relief.

However, it was embarrassing to be threatened by his son in front of so many members. He was also suppressing his anger.

He turned his head and glared at the two little fellows who were walking and playing behind Maya. He bared his fangs and revealed a fierce expression.

Qiqi and Nunu immediately trembled in fear. They drooped their tails and obediently followed behind their mother, not daring to make a scene crazily again.

The cold father finally found his father's dignity and face and his mood was much better.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and quickly walked out of the forest.

A lake appeared in front of him.

The lake was blue and clear, but the closer they went to the middle, the deeper it became.

The vegetation by the lake was lush, the flowers were abundant, and the scenery was beautiful.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were extremely excited. They immediately swung their tails and prepared to run over to play, but they were slapped back by Chu Xiaoye.

This lake looked calm, but the bottom of the lake was surging with waves, hiding a huge danger.

He always remembered the huge antenna monster at the bottom of the lake and the huge dinosaur skeleton that appeared out of nowhere.

Therefore, when he saw this beautiful lake, his first reaction was to quickly leave with his team and leave this dangerous place.

After running all the way, everyone was tired and hungry.

They should have stopped to rest for the night, drank water, and ate meat before continuing their journey tomorrow. However, Chu Xiaoye refused to allow them to do so until they were a few kilometers away from the lake.

After entering the grassland, the members of the pride of the cold father were shocked by the fertility of this new grassland.

But soon, they were shocked by the groups of herbivores.

Those gazelles were actually even larger than the zebras on their grassland\!

As for the zebras, they were even stronger than the water buffaloes over there\!

As for the water buffaloes…

"Moo—"

Suddenly, under the lead of the lead bull, the water buffaloes charged over with thunderous hooves and a murderous aura\!

The thirty-over water buffaloes were as huge as elephants. They had two horns on their heads that were long and sharp like two sharp curved blades. When they charged, they were even more terrifying than the beast tide over there\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and led the team to turn around and run towards a patch of bushes at the side.

On the grassland, there were really not many who could fight head-on with the water buffaloes that were charging at high speed, unless it was a rhinoceros herd or an elephant herd. However, the latter was not as strong as the former. They were always vast and spread throughout the grassland.

Qiqi and Nunu followed their mother and ran very quickly.

Pit and Little Mi also ran with all their might.

Facing the charge of this group of giant water buffaloes, the best choice was to dodge them. If he was a step slower, his internal organs would be crushed and he would be trampled into meat paste\!

Fortunately, there was plenty of rain on this grassland and the land was fertile. There were lush bushes everywhere.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and quickly rushed into the bushes to hide.

He let Mei Mei and Molly protect the team and continued to run deeper into the bushes. As for him, he brought Little Curly Tail, Tilly, Catherine, and Blue Eyes to hide in the bushes and on the tree, preparing to ambush this group of water buffaloes.

He was hungry and the food came to him\!

The aggressive water buffaloes charged into the bushes majestically, but because of the terrain, their speed quickly slowed down and their neat formation immediately became chaotic.

Chu Xiaoye hid on a lush tree. When a water buffalo passed by from below, he immediately jumped down. With a whoosh, his sharp claws pierced into its head and he suddenly slashed, shattering its skull\!

Then, he stepped on the water buffalo's body and jumped up, returning to the tree.

The entire process happened in a flash. The water buffaloes following behind could not react in time.

"Moo—"

The water buffalo whose skull was cut by the golden claw immediately let out a miserable scream. Its head tilted and it fell to the ground. Blood flowed from its head and its limbs twitched as it struggled in pain.

The two giant water buffaloes that were running behind could not stop in time and were tripped by it. They lowered their heads and fell heavily to the ground with a bang, their necks broken.

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to jump down again and pierced their throats with his claws.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail and the others suddenly attacked.

Little Curly Tail's tail suddenly swept out from the ground as the water buffaloes ran. "Bang bang bang\!" Many water buffaloes fell heavily to the ground in succession.

Tilly, Catherine, and the others waved their golden claws and dug out thorns with their silver claws. Soon, they cut open the stomachs of the water buffaloes that had fallen.

As for Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers, they were even more direct. They used their size and strength to slap the water buffaloes. The skulls of the giant water buffaloes shattered and they fell to the ground.

As for the Chino brothers, although they cooperated well, they were unlucky to be surrounded by four to five water buffaloes. They could only flee in panic and roar to strengthen their courage.

The other members of the pride of the cold father hid not far away and watched the scene of hunting the huge water buffaloes in shock.

The cold father was worried.

As for Aisha, Xi'er, Maya, and Callie, they were also frowning.

Although the environment here was many times better than on the other side of the mountain, the prey here was also very terrifying. They were huge and had terrifying strength. If they were to hunt alone, they could only hunt some small animals.

Fortunately, there was plenty of prey here and the little animals were very fast. Even if he did it himself, he could eat his fill. However, he would definitely encounter more danger.

The head of the water buffaloes finally woke up. They immediately roared and gathered the remaining water buffaloes, charging out of the bushes.

Along the way, they charged around, causing the trees to break and the bushes to fall to the ground. It was a mess.

Chu Xiaoye did not chase after them again. He checked his spoils of war. A total of nine water buffaloes had fallen to the ground and could not stand up again.

After the second blood rain, these water buffaloes did not seem to have grown in size anymore. Instead, they had increased in strength and physique. The other four water buffaloes with their bodies cut actually dragged their intestines and fled in the herd. Little Curly Tail and the others were dumbfounded.

Tonight was another feast.

Chu Xiaoye growled and called everyone over to start eating.

Because there were too many prey this time, Chu Xiaoye and Tilly enjoyed a water buffalo alone.

Chu Xiaoye's monopoly was natural. He was the true leader of this team.

As for Tilly's monopoly, it was firstly because of her special identity and status in the pride, and secondly, she had strong strength to rely on.

She was not considered a member of the pride of the cold father, but no one dared to provoke her in the pride of the cold father. Even Chu Xiaoye often gave in to her. Therefore, her position in the pride was very special.

Her golden claws, speed, strength, and contributions to the pride made everyone respect her.

It was because she was a guest that he had to be polite to her.

As for Catherine, the members of the pride of the cold father had long treated her as a member of the pride. Although she was cold and ruthless, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the female lions were much more intimate with her than they were with Tilly.

As for the cold father, he was most afraid of this lioness cub who would open his stomach at the slightest disagreement.

Her contributions were incomparable.

Even if she enjoyed two alone, no one would say anything. However, she was not as high-profile and pleased as Tilly.

The little girl's identity was special.

Due to Chu Xiaoye's special attention and protection, no one in this team dared to bully her.

Of course, she could also enjoy a water buffalo alone.

However, with her small appetite and body, she could not finish it even if he gave her a cow ear.

Seeing that everyone was eating with relish, the little girl took out the sharp knife from her waist and walked to Chu Xiaoye's side, starting to carefully cut the fresh steak.

Just like Chu Xiaoye, she especially liked to eat steak.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at her. He deliberately lowered his head and pulled out a thick beef intestine from the cow's stomach. He dragged it in front of her and let her eat it.

The little girl sat on the ground in fright, then swung her little hand and slapped his butt. She wrinkled her small and perky nose and slanted her bright eyes with a coquettish expression. She said in a childish voice, "Annoying\!"

Chu Xiaoye's butt was slapped. Just as he was about to open his eyes in anger and erupt with the dignity of a lion, he suddenly realized that a stench surged into his mouth. He hurriedly opened his mouth and spat out the intestines in his mouth. Looking down, because his teeth were too sharp, he accidentally pierced the intestines\!

He actually ate a mouthful of cow shit\!

"Ugh —"

"Hahahahahaha…"

The little girl sat on the ground and immediately convulsed with laughter. She was extremely happy and her fair little hands were even grabbing his tail and tugging.

As for Little Curly Tail and the others, who were eating heartily, they were suddenly frightened by the little girl's strange laughter. They raised their heads and looked at her in shock and strangeness.

"Hey\! The expression on this little thing's face and the sounds it makes are so rich\!"

That was definitely what everyone was thinking.

When Little Curly Tail was happy, he would swing his tail and jump around. At most, he would open his mouth and let out strange sounds. He was not as magical as the little girl's laughter.

Hearing the little girl's laughter, Little Curly Tail, Tilly, Mei Mei, and the others could not help but open their mouths and reveal distorted and ferocious smiles.

Laughter was contagious, but for lions, this contagious laughter and smile was difficult for them to imitate.

Seeing that everyone was looking over, the little girl's delicate and exquisite face immediately turned red. She immediately stopped and wiped her tears from laughing. She continued to lower her head to cut the beef, but she still let out a puff from time to time. Her eyes were curved and she was cute.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and sucked a few mouthfuls of blood. He rinsed his mouth and spat it out before continuing to eat meat.

At this moment, the cry of vultures suddenly came from above.

The dense bushes did not cover the sharp eyes of the cleaners in the sky.

Soon, more and more vultures circled in the sky.

Chu Xiaoye looked up, and golden light flickered in his eyes. He could see further and more clearly.

The vultures also became larger and stronger. Their claws and mouths were much sharper than before.

Its ability to find prey naturally improved.

The strong smell of blood spread out and drifted out of the bushes and into the grassland along with the cold wind blowing from the sea, attracting many carnivores.

The jackals, wild dogs, and hyenas that were paying attention to the movements of the vultures in the sky came after hearing the news.

Chu Xiaoye's team would definitely not be able to finish this water beef. However, when they ate, they would never allow other carnivores to approach.

This was the rule and the dignity of their pride.

The first to discover them was the vultures that had been circling in the sky and crying out. The first to arrive was a group of tall and strong lions.

It turned out that this forest was within the territory of their pride.

As for Chu Xiaoye's team, they were invaders.

Two strong black-haired lions came aggressively with eight equally strong female lions.

The two lions were larger than the Chino brothers and much larger than the cold father, but smaller than Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur.

After all, Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur were once rare experts on this grassland.

When the two black-haired lions and the eight female lions saw Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers get up, as well as the Chino brothers, the cold father, Little Curly Tail, and Chu Xiaoye, their murderous aura immediately paused and they stopped in place.

The lions' fight and the pride's fight were mostly determined by numbers.

Chu Xiaoye had a total of nine lions on his side, and a few of them were extremely terrifying in size and aura.

The black-haired lion king, who had come with a murderous aura, immediately cowered. It did not speak any nonsense. After pausing for a few seconds, it immediately turned around and fled.

Its brothers and the female lions did not dare to stay any longer. They immediately turned around and followed behind him, fleeing in panic.

In this situation, why would he still need territory? It would be good enough if he could survive\!

Blue Eyes and the rest, who were about to start a massacre, looked disdainfully at their retreating backs and ignored them. They continued to lie down and eat.

The other carnivores that were preparing to surround him did not dare to come over and court death when they saw this scene. They retreated into the distance, drooled, and waited patiently.

The little girl held the knife and leaned gently on Chu Xiaoye, concentrating on cutting the beef. Her golden hair intertwined with Chu Xiaoye's golden mane, making them look like one.
