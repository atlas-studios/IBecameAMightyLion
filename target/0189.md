Chapter 189: Challenging the Lion King

"Boom\!"

The iron hooves flew and the ground trembled\!

Under the lead of the water buffalo leader, the huge water buffalo chased the Chino brothers with a murderous aura and entered the bushes.

Due to the crazy growth of the trees and bushes in the forest during this period of time, they were dense and lush. They immediately divided the neat rows of water buffaloes.

These water buffaloes relied on their size and strength to be fierce and were not afraid at all. They moved through the trees and bushes everywhere, chasing the Chino brothers and looking for other lions.

The water buffaloes and lions were enemies to begin with. Now that they had attacked the lion's camp, they naturally wanted to find other lions. It would be even better if there were cubs. They would trample them to death\!

The water buffalo leader brought a few water buffaloes and continued to chase after the Chino brothers.

The Chino brothers were also considered smart. They deliberately jumped around the bushes and ran towards the places with dense bushes.

Due to the soaking of the river, many thick roots of the trees on the ground were exposed, like ropes that were placed in the grass.

There were also some fallen trees and thick green vines that occupied the space on the ground.

Therefore, when the water buffaloes ran in the forest, they would accidentally trip on the ground and not be able to get up for a long time.

However, because they were too big and the horns on their heads were as sharp as two sickles, the Chino brothers did not dare to turn around to attack even if they fell to the ground.

This made the group of giant water buffaloes even more arrogant.

They let out mooing noises and ran around the bushes. Not only were they chasing the Chino brothers, but they were also chasing other herbivores, treating this place as their new home.

The bushes were lush. If they stayed here, they could eat for a long time.

However, the king of this territory would not allow this group of dangerous enemies to stay here forever.

When the water buffalo leader brought a few water buffaloes and chased after the Chino brothers, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine quickly jumped down from the tree and started to kill the other water buffaloes.

Although these water buffaloes were huge and had terrifying charging power, they lost all their advantages in the bushes.

Their huge bodies would become their burden.

"Whoosh\!"

When a water buffalo was chasing a wild rabbit, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped out of the grass at the side and suddenly grabbed its neck\!

That sharp golden claw directly grabbed off half of the water buffalo's neck\!

"Bang\!"

Blood sprayed out and the water buffalo fell to the ground, letting out a terrified scream.

On the other side.

Catherine also suddenly jumped out of the grass and slashed the stomach of a female water buffalo\!

The female water buffalo was extremely fierce and immediately flew into a rage. As she bled and her intestines flew out, she lowered her head and charged ferociously at Catherine.

Catherine jumped lightly onto the tree beside her.

The female water buffalo hit the tree heavily with a bang. Then, it fell to the ground and let out a desperate moo.

The water buffalo leader seemed to have heard their call and immediately stopped chasing the Chino brothers and returned quickly with the other water buffaloes.

When they saw the corpse of their companion on the ground, they were shocked and furious.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye deliberately pretended to be injured and limped out of the grass towards the bushes at the side.

"Mooâ€”"

The water buffalo leader was furious. He immediately brought his companions and chased after him with his iron hooves rumbling.

Chu Xiaoye deliberately slowed down and ran for a while, then crawled into the bushes in front of him.

The water buffalo leader lowered his head and followed closely. With a whoosh, he rushed into the bushes and prepared to use his sharp horns to stab him to death.

In the end, just as it rushed into the dense bushes, it had only taken a few steps when its two front legs suddenly sank down. With a whoosh, it fell into a mud pit\!

Its entire head and upper body were stuck in it. Its butt was stuck up high and its hind legs were bouncing with all its might.

The herd of water buffaloes following closely behind had just rushed into the bushes when they were tripped by him one after another and fell to the ground in a sorry state.

A strong water buffalo happened to trip over its body and sat in the mud pit, pressing its head heavily into the mud at the bottom of the pit\!

When the water buffalo finally got up from the mudhole after struggling for a long time, the water buffalo leader had already suffocated to death.

At this moment, Catherine suddenly jumped out from the grass at the side. After slashing open the abdomen of a water buffalo with her claws, she turned around and ran.

The water buffaloes finally panicked and ran out of the bushes.

Catherine originally wanted to continue chasing after him, but she was stopped by Chu Xiaoye.

All this beef was enough for them to eat for many days. There was no need to waste it.

Since the other party had already fled, he would spare their lives. They would talk about it when they were hungry.

The hard way is to take the path of sustainable development.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine out of the bushes and prepared to pick up the two female lions.

In the end, he realized that the herd of water buffaloes chasing the two female lions had already fled. On the grass, there was the corpse of a water buffalo. The two female lions were lying there, one biting its mouth and the other its neck.

The water buffalo had already stopped breathing, but they still did not let go.

It seemed that they had been chased too miserably by this herd of water buffaloes just now and were now taking revenge to vent their anger.

However, just the two of them were actually able to kill this water buffalo in a group of giant water buffaloes. Their strength and courage were evident.

At least, they were much stronger than the two cowards, the Chino brothers.

When the two female lions saw him and Catherine walking over, they immediately stood up and retreated to the side, looking very respectful.

Obviously, they had already treated him as a king.

When eating, the lion king took priority.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and did not refuse. Instead, he walked in front of the water buffalo's corpse and cut open its back with his claws. After biting off a mouthful of ribs and meat, he turned to leave.

This meant that he accepted their allegiance.

The two female lions were very excited. They looked at Catherine fearfully and still did not dare to go forward to eat.

Catherine looked at them coldly and did not go forward to share the prey. She did not give them any face and turned to leave.

Catherine was actually secretly happy.

It seemed that he left these two female lions behind only to expand the pride and increase his strength. It was not becauseâ€¦ of some reason.

Chu Xiaoye swallowed the steak in his mouth. Before he walked into the bushes, a familiar roar suddenly came from the distant grassland.

It was the cry of the blue-eyed lion king.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. He hesitated for a moment before turning around and walking over.

The blue-eyed lion king left with the white lions the last time and went to the mysterious snow mountain. No one knew when it returned or why it went there.

His roar was filled with anger and protest. It seemed that he had encountered a challenger.

Now, the animals and plants on this grassland had mutated. He wondered if this lion king that he had disfigured had become stronger.

He decided to take a look.

At the same time.

On the other side of the mountain, the grassland, which was on the verge of death from the torture of the dry season, was full of life again.

Plants grew crazily and animals went crazy.

In the territory of the cold father's pride, two strong wandering lions with lush manes let out roars of protest and provocation. They were also challenging the lion king in the territory.

However, before the lion king could make a move, his son, who had yet to grow a mane, was one step ahead of him. With a whoosh, he rushed out of the camp and roared excitedly.

The two wandering lions were stunned.
