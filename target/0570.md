Chapter 570: Giant King Kong

The artillery rumbled and the island trembled\!

All the creatures on the island almost attacked in full force, like angry soldiers who shared a common enemy and surged towards the place where the artillery was fired like a tide\!

The periphery of the dense forest was instantly flattened\!

The beast pack in front of him surged over\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the legendary dinosaur, shocked and shocked. He hurriedly turned around and said, "Run\!"

He held his sword and suddenly ran towards the pursuers behind him\!

Lanisi and the others changed directions without hesitation and followed behind him.

After being stunned for a few seconds, the twenty Qin family members hurriedly changed directions and rushed towards the navy.

The Southern Tang Navy had long realized that something was wrong. When they saw them turn around and return, they were about to catch them when they suddenly realized that the bushes not far in front of them were quickly falling\!

Then, they saw a terrifying scene\!

The black mass of dinosaurs was roaring and running over under the roar of a huge gorilla\!

"Run\! Run\!"

The navy general's expression changed drastically. He no longer cared about chasing after the Qin family villains and hurriedly ordered loudly.

More than 1,000 navy men immediately turned around and fled in fear\!

However, how could their speed compare to those running dinosaurs?

The dinosaur army quickly caught up.

The first to be attacked and trampled was the twenty Qin family descendants running at the back.

They were sent flying by the running dinosaurs and their bones instantly shattered. Those who did not die were also trampled into meat paste after landing on the ground.

"Catherine\! Bring Doya up the tree\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately instructed.

Catherine did not hesitate and immediately ran to Doya's side and crawled under her legs. She carried her and suddenly ran towards a thick ancient tree in front of her like an arrow.

The ancient tree was tall and thick, towering into the clouds. It had probably lived here for more than ten thousand years. Although those dinosaurs were powerful, they could not break it.

Furthermore, when dinosaurs ran, they specifically avoided these trees. Otherwise, they would be crushed\!

Doya lay on Catherine and hugged her neck tightly\!

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine rushed up like lightning and climbed to a high place. She placed Doya between the dense leaves to prevent the pterodactyls in the sky from discovering her.

Then, the female cub immediately rushed down the tree.

"Fei'er\! Vilis\! Come and ride on my back\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned into a lion and crawled between Vilis' legs with a whoosh, pushing her up.

His current lion body was no longer the same as before and had become much taller.

Vilis cried out in shock and hurriedly hugged his neck. She was embarrassed and angry, but she knew that the situation was critical and did not dare to bicker.

Fei'er also hurriedly ran over and rode on Chu Xiaoye's back.

"Hold on tight\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared and immediately used all his strength to jump up. He actually jumped dozens of meters high and jumped onto the tree. He quickly climbed up and placed Vilis and Fei'er beside Doya.

At this moment, Catherine had already carried Lanisi and jumped onto the tree.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to jump down to pick up the remaining Denise, the tall and long silver-haired girl actually ran for a distance. With a jump, she lightly jumped onto the branch of the tree and climbed up agilely like an ape.

The moment Denise jumped onto the tree, the dinosaur army had already roared and rushed over.

Although a dinosaur saw Denise, it did not dare to stop because as long as it stopped, its companions behind it would knock it to the ground and trample it to death.

"Denise\! Good job\!"

Chu Xiaoye quickly climbed down to receive her and landed in front of her. "Come up quickly\!"

Although she was agile and not too fast, and the dinosaurs behind were very tall, her danger was not resolved.

Denise hesitated for a moment, but still rode on his back and hugged his neck tightly.

Chu Xiaoye quickly climbed up.

At this moment, he saw the huge gorilla that was like a small mountain again.

The gorilla carried a big tree and roared as it walked over, like a general giving orders.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He immediately carried Denise and continued to climb up. At the same time, he said to Catherine, "Transport them to the canopy. The higher the better\!"

The huge gorilla was like a diamond and was too tall. Their current positions might be discovered by the other party. Only at the highest point could they hide on the gorilla's head and not be discovered.

This tree was at least 80 to 90 meters tall. The giant gorilla was not that tall.

Such giant trees were not common outside, but there were many here. The highest tree in the outside world was only 130 meters tall, and there were even more than 200 meters of giant trees here.

Chu Xiaoye carried Denise. When he passed by Vilis, he carried her on his body and continued to climb up, quickly reaching the canopy.

The canopy was still thick and dense. Even with his size, it was more than enough to stand here with a few people. It would not break because of this.

He did not stop at all and went down to transport Fei'er and Denise up again.

Catherine also transported Doya up.

Soon, everyone hid in the dense canopy.

The dinosaurs below were already running in this primitive forest. Other than these huge and thick trees, many low and fragile bushes and trees were trampled to the ground.

The huge and ferocious black gorilla had already carried the tree and came close.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at the muscular and strong giant figure and was secretly shocked. He did not expect the King Kong he had seen on television in his previous life to appear here.

That fierce and terrifying aura could make people tremble even from afar.

Chu Xiaoye immediately winked at the girls on the canopy and told them not to move or make any sound.

If he was discovered by this giant gorilla, he would definitely die.

Actually, without him saying, Lanisi and the others had already turned pale in fright. They did not move and almost stopped breathing.

There were pterodactyls in the sky, dinosaurs on the ground, and giant gorillas holding the fort. If they were discovered, they would definitely die.

When the giant gorilla looked in front and walked past from below, Chu Xiaoye, Lanisi, and the others secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

However, before they could walk far, the giant gorilla suddenly stopped and raised its head slightly.

Chu Xiaoye's heart tightened and he held his breath.

Unexpectedly, the gorilla only raised its head, raised its thick fingers, and dug its nostrils. Then, with a whoosh, it flicked a lump of snot out and continued forward.

Lanisi and the others were already dripping with cold sweat that soaked their clothes.

"Roarâ€”"

Right at this moment, an ear-piercing cry suddenly sounded from the sky\!

A black pterodactyl seemed to have discovered them. It actually lowered its head and started to circle above their heads.

The huge black gorilla suddenly stopped\!
