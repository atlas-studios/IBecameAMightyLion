Chapter 147: The Killer in the River

There was a strong enemy in front and a river behind\!

He could not retreat\!

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps forward and protected the female cub behind him.

This time, they could only fight with their backs to the river\!

"Roar—"

The brothers roared angrily and stood beside him on the left and right.

Although their bodies still looked thin and shriveled, the might of the lion was still there\!

The little elephant stood behind them and curled its nose, actually rolling up the female cub and throwing it on its back.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye took the initiative and rushed over\!

The twenty-plus strong gorillas surged over ferociously like a black tide\!

If he did not go forward to disrupt their formation, the few of them would be attacked by these gorillas into the river, drowned or bitten to death\!

Therefore, he had to take the initiative to attack\!

When he rushed towards the group of gorillas, the Chino brothers followed closely and roared as they rushed up\!

Like sharp spears, they charged forward bravely and pierced into the formation of the gorillas\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, he was like the tip of a spear that was unstoppable\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The blood in his entire body boiled as his palms danced ferociously. Wherever he went, those gorillas baring their sharp teeth would be slapped to the side and fall to the ground\!

The other gorillas were furious when they saw this and surged towards him\!

Densely packed sharp claws pounced on him\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and jumped up. He stepped on the head of a gorilla and jumped out of the dense encirclement. As he rushed into the forest, he swung his palm\!

Beside the big tree in the forest stood a tall white-haired gorilla\!

It kept letting out sharp roars, as if it was commanding the group of gorillas\!

It should be the leader of this group of gorillas\!

To catch thieves, first catch the king\!

Chu Xiaoye was like an arrow that had been released from the bow and flew towards it quickly\!

When the white-haired gorilla saw this, it immediately let out an angry roar. It actually jumped suddenly and pounced ferociously at him\!

Just as the two sides were about to pounce on each other and hit each other heavily, Chu Xiaoye suddenly sank down and landed first, rolling over from below\!

Just as it landed on the ground, before it could turn around, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up from behind it and bit its neck\!

The other gorillas that had just rushed close immediately stopped in their tracks and froze in place. They bared their sharp teeth and let out angry roars.

Chu Xiaoye bit the white-haired gorilla's neck tightly and raised his head to look at them with a bone-chilling gaze\!

At this moment, the Chino brothers finally erupted with the strength of lions. They suddenly rushed up from behind this group of gorillas and threw two gorillas to the ground, biting their throats\!

The gorilla pack that had been lined up neatly just now immediately turned into a mess\!

Some rushed towards the Chino brothers, some surrounded Chu Xiaoye, and some were preparing to escape in fright\!

"Crack\!"

Before they could surround him, Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and bit the throat of this gorilla leader. Then, he pounced on the gorilla in front of him\!

"Moo—"

Right at this moment, the little elephant also swung its nose and rushed over\!

Although it was still small, its small tank-like body had a natural advantage over the gorilla\!

Even if it did not have sharp teeth, claws, or the ferocity of a carnivore, no one dared to match its impact on the grassland\!

Even a rash and violent rhinoceros had to retreat\!

Furthermore, its thick and strong nose was like a flexible iron whip. With a random swing, these gorillas would fly\!

Its fierce impact immediately messed up the already chaotic formation of the gorillas\!

Many gorillas started to flee in panic\!

The little elephant swept up a gorilla and swung it to the side. The gorilla immediately flew out and smashed into another gorilla with a bang\!

Hence, the two gorillas fell to the ground\!

Wherever it passed, the gorillas avoided it in fear\!

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to attack from left to right, jump up and down, and swing his palms continuously. His sharp teeth never missed\!

In less than a moment, more than ten gorillas fell to the ground and could not get up again\!

Seeing that the situation was hopeless, the remaining gorillas hurriedly roared and fled towards the forest\!

The Chino brothers' eyes turned red from killing. They roared and chased after them. They pounced on another two gorillas and started biting fiercely\!

This battle finally made their long-silent lion nature erupt\!

The other gorillas fled and soon disappeared into the forest.

The grass by the river was in a mess. Looking across, the corpses of gorillas were everywhere.

The Chino brothers returned, their mouths full of blood and bodies covered in wounds.

They did not stop. Instead, they walked towards some gorillas that were lying on the ground and continued to bite.

Chu Xiaoye's back and butt were scratched. A few scars appeared and he felt a burning pain.

However, they won this battle.

Not only did they win, but they also obtained the tools to cross the river.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the gorilla corpses all over the ground and immediately growled. He took the lead to bite a gorilla and walked to the river, placing the gorilla's corpse in the mud by the river.

Although the Chino brothers did not know what he was going to do, they immediately walked over with the gorilla's corpse in their mouths.

Doya hurriedly jumped down from the little elephant's back and wanted to help, but she realized that with her strength, she could not move the corpses of these gorillas.

The little elephant used its nose to roll up the corpse of a gorilla easily.

Chu Xiaoye spread the corpses of a few gorillas on the mud by the river. After stepping on them, not only would they not sink, they would also be a little elastic.

This was a good point to exert strength on.

He stood on the gorilla's corpse and looked up at the opposite shore.

With his jumping ability and strong muscles, he should be able to jump over a distance of about four to five meters.

Even if they could not cross, they would not be too far away.

The river opposite was also a shallow pool. As long as he landed there, there should be no problem.

Now, the most important problem was the ferocious fish groups at the bottom of the river that were comparable to piranhas\!

The little elephant and Chino brothers definitely had to swim over.

The river water flowed, and those fish could not always gather in this river segment.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to use the gorillas' corpses to lure them away.

When the natives living near the Amazon River had an emergency and needed to cross the river, they would usually use this method to throw a lamb and lure away the ferocious piranhas before crossing quickly.

There were still more than ten gorilla corpses, which should be enough.

He especially bit open the stomachs of these gorillas to make the smell of blood stronger.

After making preparations, he looked at the little elephant and growled. He then looked at the opposite shore, signaling that it had to swim over and be the first to go over.

Here, it was the tallest and had a long nose that could breathe. It naturally had to shoulder the responsibility of exploring the depths of the river.

Its thick elephant legs could also test if the fish at the bottom of the river were all attracted by the gorilla's corpse.

Even if it was bitten by those fish, it would not be a big problem.

Look at its nose. Previously, it had been bitten by those fish a few times. When it was dealing with those ferocious gorillas, it was still brave and strong\!

She was completely fine\!

This little stupid elephant's skin was thick and its life force was tenacious. It would never back down from this exploration mission\!

Chu Xiaoye did not give it any chance to refuse. He immediately bit a gorilla that had its stomach cut open and walked three meters upstream. Then, he placed the corpse on a shallow pool by the river, preventing it from being washed away by the water.

A few seconds after he put it down, a few splashes suddenly appeared on the water in front of him. Then, a dense school of fish rushed over excitedly and started to fight crazily.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate and immediately returned. He picked up the corpse of a gorilla and placed it in the shallows three meters downstream.

Soon, another school of fish smelled blood and charged over ferociously\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately ran in front of the female cub and bit its neck. He picked it up and jumped onto the little elephant's back.

After placing the female cub on the elephant's back, he jumped down again. He picked up the corpse of another gorilla and threw it into the river in front of him.

Indeed, until the gorilla's corpse sank to the bottom of the water, he did not see the fish.

The fish were attracted by the corpses of the gorillas on both sides of the shallow pool\!

He immediately urged the little elephant to quickly cross the river\!

The little elephant looked at the fish fighting crazily for food in the shallows on both sides. Its heart was filled with fear. It stood by the river, hesitating.

"Pfft—"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and farted at its nose\!

A black smoke immediately covered its head\!

The little elephant's entire body trembled as if it was being helped by a god. It hurriedly raised its nose and sucked all the black smoke clean. Then, without hesitation, it walked down the river with a whoosh. As if it had suddenly eaten a stimulant, it rushed excitedly and bravely towards the opposite shore\!

Chu Xiaoye picked up the corpse of a gorilla again and threw it into the river.

At this moment, he could have jumped on the elephant's back and gone over together.

However, if he left, the Chino brothers would definitely not have the courage to swim over.

Furthermore, the corpses of the gorillas on both sides of the shallow pool had already been devoured by the crazy fish.

At this moment, if they did not continue to replenish the gorillas' corpses, those ferocious fish would definitely surge over and attack the little elephant. The Chino brothers would definitely not be able to leave.

Therefore, he had to cross last.

When the elephant walked to the middle of the river, Chu Xiaoye realized that the river water had just submerged its back. Its heavy body also blocked the flowing river water a little.

It did not look panicked. Clearly, the fish at the bottom of the river had been attracted away.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately growled at the brothers, signaling them to take this opportunity to swim over\!

This was the safest time\!

Although the brothers were afraid, they knew that if they did not leave now, they would never be able to leave again\!

They looked gratefully at the young boss and immediately jumped into the water. They raised their heads and swam towards the opposite shore with all their might\!

Cats were very good at swimming.

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to look at them. He immediately picked up the gorilla's corpse and placed it on the shallows on both sides\!

The two groups of piranhas went crazy again\!

Finally, the Chino brothers and the little elephant swam safely to the shallows opposite.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate anymore and immediately took a few steps back, preparing to sprint and jump.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a huge wave suddenly splashed from behind the brothers\!

Then, a huge black crocodile opened its bloody mouth full of fangs and jumped out of the water. It suddenly bit Little Chino\!

At this moment, Little Chino happened to jump up from the shallows and dodged a calamity\!

Seeing this terrifying scene, the brothers were frightened and hurriedly crawled ashore.

The huge crocodile missed its bite and fell into the water with a whoosh. However, it did not sink but floated on the water and continued to look at them unwillingly.

"Whoosh\!"

At this moment, two more crocodiles jumped out from the water and started to devour the piranhas that were snatching food\!

The entire river was in chaos.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the river, his heart cold.

The Chino brothers, little elephant, and Doya, who was on the little elephant's back, looked at him in a daze.
