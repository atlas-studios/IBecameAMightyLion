Chapter 33: Battle\!

They had come to take revenge\!

The miserable scream of their companion from last night had completely angered them\!

They knew the strength of this pride\!

As long as the lion was not here, they could use their numerical advantage to do whatever they wanted here\!

The scouts they sent out sent news.

The lion was mating with a lioness on the grassland.

In the pride's camp, other than the five young cubs, there was not even a mature female lion\!

This was definitely a rare opportunity\!

Samantha, the hyena queen, decided to take this opportunity to kill all the cubs in the pride\!

This way, in the future, this pride of lions would have no successors and become weaker and weaker until they were completely defeated\!

At this moment.

Under the lead of Queen Samantha, more than twenty hyenas were approaching the pride camp quickly along the dense grass\!

Suddenly, a female cub appeared not far in front of them\!

She walked to a patch of bushes, tilted her head, and bit a green branch. They did not know what she was doing.

Perhaps she was playing.

Samantha was secretly happy. She looked at her subordinates around her and immediately accelerated, charging at the female cub\!

The grass on the ground rustled\!

The wild rabbit hiding in the bushes was suddenly frightened by the vast and mighty murderous aura. It jumped out with a whoosh and ran away\!

Gigi, who was biting the branch, heard the noise and loosened her teeth. She turned her head and looked behind her.

Then\!

She saw a scene that shocked her beyond compare\!

A large group of spotted hyenas were baring their fangs and charging over with a murderous aura\!

"Roar\!"

She suddenly let out a terrified roar and ran towards the camp\!

However, in her extreme panic and fear, she fell\!

When she got up, the hyena queen, Samantha, and her general had already pounced on her and bitten her\!

Gigi was shocked and afraid. The blood flowing in her body made her suddenly become brave and desperate amid pain and fear.

She suddenly turned around and bit at the two terrifying female hyenas\!

Samantha and her general hurriedly retreated and avoided her sharp teeth\!

The hyena army charged forward\!

Gigi endured the pain and ran for her life, letting out anxious and terrified cries.

Chu Xiaoye, who was resting on the tree, had already reacted when Gigi let out her first roar\!

When he saw the densely packed hyena army chasing after Gigi and charging towards him, he did not hesitate and immediately climbed down the tree, roared, and rushed into the bushes\!

Little Curly Tail did not hesitate either. He bared his fangs and followed him\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas' cries rang out\!

Mei Mei only hesitated for a moment before she immediately followed behind Little Curly Tail and rushed up.

Although she was still afraid of hyenas, she would never be weak in the face of their provocation\!

Because she was a lion\!

From the moment she was born, the blood flowing in her body had given her courage and perseverance, as well as her hatred for these old enemies\!

For the territory and for her family, she would never retreat\!

Lars, who was sleeping, heard the noise and immediately jumped up from the grass in fright.

When he saw his siblings bravely charging up to fight those despicable enemies, the blood in his body surged up with a whoosh\!

"Roarâ€”"

He suddenly roared angrily and erupted with the dignity and aura of a lion. He charged forward ferociously\!

The battle between the hyenas and the young cubs had officially begun\!

A hyena bit Gigi's thigh and she fell to the ground.

Just as the hyenas were about to pounce on her, Chu Xiaoye suddenly dashed forward like a bolt of lightning and bit the neck of a female hyena. He tilted his head and sent it flying\!

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

He landed beside Gigi and attacked with his claws from left to right. The power in his body was surging and he slapped the hyenas that were pouncing on him one by one\!

The other hyenas were a little stunned and immediately stopped in their tracks, looking at him in shock and fear.

At this moment.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei rushed up\!

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail was not afraid of the strength and numbers of the hyenas. He pounced forward and bit at a male hyena\!

The male hyena was frightened and hurriedly dodged before running back.

The few hyenas standing beside it were also frightened by Little Curly Tail's ferocious aura and ran away.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Samantha, the hyena queen, let out a dignified and sharp cry.

The twenty-plus hyenas immediately cried out as they ran, surrounding the five young cubs in the middle.

They circled around and gradually approached, letting out provocative cries.

Lars bared his fangs and roared fiercely, but he saw that there were too many enemies and did not dare to charge forward.

The five young cubs leaned back against each other to prevent these despicable enemies from attacking from behind.

The hyenas did not dare to rush up at that moment.

The ferocity and strength Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail displayed just now gave them a great sense of deterrence\!

These two young male cubs were not as fragile as they had thought\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Samantha, the hyena queen, was anxious. She immediately ordered them to sprint\!

This was a rare opportunity\!

If the lion and the female lions that went out to hunt returned, their sneak attack would be wasted\!

It was just five cubs, why would they be afraid\!

Samantha decided to do it herself and summoned her companions' courage\!

She saw the injured Gigi, bared her fangs, and pounced on her\!

The two generals beside her immediately followed suit\!

The other hyenas around her immediately calmed down and charged forward when they saw how brave the Queen was\!

More than twenty hyenas bared their cold and sharp fangs and surged over like a tide\!

At this moment, not to mention the injured Gigi, even the extremely bold Little Curly Tail was terrified when he saw this terrifying scene\!

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye was the first to attack. He pounced forward and sent a strong female hyena flying\!

The other hyenas pounced on them ferociously under the Queen's lead\!

To catch thieves, first catch the king\!

Chu Xiaoye wanted to bite the hyena queen to death first, but there were too many hyenas in front of him. He could barely take care of himself\!

After slapping the two hyenas away, he realized that his back had already been bitten a few times\!

The formation formed by the five young cubs was broken up by the twenty-over ferocious hyenas in an instant\!

Gigi was soon covered in blood.

Little Curly Tail's roars were more furious than before\!

He was surrounded by five strong female hyenas and his body was covered in blood\!

There were only three male hyenas against Mei Mei.

However, the three male hyenas were extremely cunning. They only circled around her and did not bite her. Their goal was to trap her so that she could not save the other cubs.

After taking down the other cubs, they would deal with her together\!

Lars was bitten away.

When the two hyenas pounced at him and attracted his attention, a hyena suddenly attacked from behind and bit his butt\!

If he had not reacted in time and dodged, the hyena behind him might have bitten his testicle\!

He was in pain and fear. He turned around and fled\!

The number of hyenas attacking Chu Xiaoye increased to more than ten\!

Even the hyena queen and her two strongest subordinates surrounded them\!

There were only two hyenas beside Gigi.

She was already lying on the ground, her two hind legs broken and her entire body covered in wounds. She could only bare her fangs helplessly and let out a trembling roar, hoping to scare the enemies around her.

A hyena bit towards her, attracting her sharp teeth.

A hyena cunningly attacked from the side and bit her spine\!

The intense pain made Gigi let out a miserable and desperate roar.

Chu Xiaoye wanted to rush over to save her, but he could barely take care of himself\!

Although he had bitten off the throats of the three hyenas, his thighs, back, and even head were riddled with wounds and dripping with blood\!

The hyenas around him did not decrease. Instead, they increased in number and became more and more ferocious\!

At this time, it was already too late to climb a tree to save his life.

He could not abandon Gigi, Mei Mei, and his younger brother.

Blood dyed his eyes red.

Hatred and anger surged in his chest\!

His claws and teeth became even more ferocious\!

"Whoosh\!"

A female hyena's body was cut open by his sharp claws\!

Blood sprayed\!

Her intestines and organs fell to the ground\!
