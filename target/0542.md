 Chapter 542: The Queen's Man\!

"Open the door\! Quickly open the city gate\!"

Cesar brought the hundreds of warriors of the Lusni family and finally broke through the encirclement and returned to Bingluo City.

However, when they ran under the city gate in a panic and shouted at the top, they realized that the flag of the Lusni family was no longer stuck on it.

The heavy city gate was still closed.

Seeing this scene, Cesar's face turned pale.

He could not believe that this was true\!

This was his only chance to turn the tables and survive\!

Other than his five thousand Lusni soldiers, there was also Mormont's twenty thousand-strong army in Bingluo City\!

"Open the door\! Open the door\! I'm Cesar\!"

He comforted himself with a tremble. The people on the city wall were definitely dozing off and did not hear his cries.

However, no matter how he shouted, no one stuck their heads out to care about him.

The pursuers behind him had already roared and rushed over.

Carter personally chased after them with the cavalry\!

Cesar was terrified. As he ordered the soldiers to slap the door hard, he continued to shout at the top.

Finally, a head popped out.

At the same time, the torch lit up the face and the other faces on the city wall.

"Lord Cesar, why are you so terrified?"

Mormont actually joked. His wrinkled old face was filled with a teasing smile.

Just as Chu Xiaoye had expected, their army easily took down the five thousand members of the Lusni family and he regained control of the entire Bingluo City.

He had been worried that Cesar would return with the army, but now, it seemed that all his worries were unnecessary.

"Lord Night is indeed as accurate as a god\! Cesar lost."

His beloved granddaughter helped him praise the youth beside him sincerely.

The smile on Mormont's face grew wider.

"Mormont\! You old thing\! Quickly order them to open the city gate\! Otherwise, I'll turn your Bingluo City into ashes\!"

Cesar's heart turned completely cold, but he was still struggling one last time. Perhaps this old man, like before, would suddenly submit to him again for the sake of the entire city's citizens?

However, he was clearly thinking too much.

Mormont smiled and said, "Lord Cesar, I'm afraid you can't save yourself."

At this moment, Carter had already rushed close to the city wall with the cavalry.

Cesar roared with a ferocious expression, "Mormont\! You old thing\! I should have cut you into meat paste long ago and roasted your grandchildren\! My Lusni family will never let you go\!"

Mormont shrugged and said, "Clearly, Princess Carter will not let go of your family."

Cesar suddenly turned around and knelt on the ground, shouting, "Princess Carter\! Your Majesty\! I, Cesar, am willing to surrender\! I'm willing to bring the soldiers of the Lusni family to serve you and sacrifice my life\!"

"Kill\! Leave none alive\!"

However, what Carter answered him with, was these cold words.

"Ah\!"

Cesar's head flew up first.

Then, the hundreds of orc warriors were quickly slaughtered.

Chu Xiaoye shouted from the city wall, "Carter, you shouldn't have killed them. You need a large number of warriors now, don't you?"

Carter's face was covered in blood. She raised her head and said in high spirits, "I've already recruited thirty thousand of the Lusni family's forty-five thousand troops. The remaining fifteen thousand are all dead. As for these hundreds of soldiers, they risked their lives to break out of the encirclement for Cesar. It can be seen how loyal they are to the Lusni family.Therefore, I don't need them."

"However, they have already abandoned their weapons and surrendered."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her mockingly.

Carter laughed mockingly. "How do you know that they surrendered willingly? Since they are so loyal to the Lusni family, perhaps they deliberately surrendered and waited to assassinate me?"

Chu Xiaoye did not speak again and looked down at the corpses all over the ground.

"Lord Mormont, the army of the Lusni family has been cleared. Please open the city gate\!"

Carter raised her head and shouted.

"Thank you for helping me out, Your Highness. Please wait a moment."

Just as Mormont was about to instruct the soldiers below to open the city gate, Doya, who was standing beside him, suddenly tugged at his clothes quietly, but she did not say anything.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly looked at him and said, "Lord Mormont, you can't open the door\!"

Mormont was stunned and looked at him in shock. "Aren't you Her Highness's counselor?"

Chu Xiaoye said coldly, "No, I'm just a pitiful worm she's holding hostage."

Then, he warned solemnly, "Lord Mormont, have you heard the story of driving the wolf to face the tiger? The army of the Lusni family is a pack of wolves to you. Now that you've finally chased the wolf away, is Lord Mormont going to open the city gate and welcome a group of tigers that are stronger than wolves in?"

Mormont suddenly laughed and turned to look at his granddaughter beside him. "Look, just now, before coming up, you even reminded me in a low voice that no matter what, no matter who is outside, I should not open the door. Even if it's the princess or even if this princess' counselor asks me to open the door, I have to refuse. Doya, you still underestimated this Lord Night."

The young girl's face turned red, but she bent down solemnly and bowed at Chu Xiaoye. "Lord Night, Doya was overthinking. Doya really did not expect that Lord Night could reject the princess for the sake of my Bingluo City."

Chu Xiaoye revealed a self-mocking smile and said, "It was all for you and myself."

He suddenly stuck out his head from the city wall and shouted down, "Carter, Lord Mormont will not open the city gate. You should leave. As for the promise Lord Mormont gave you previously, you will still fulfill it. Right, Lord Mormont?"

He turned around and looked at the old man.

He believed that this old man was not really stupid but was pretending to be stupid. If he was smart enough, not only would he happily fulfill his promise, he would also increase it a lot. After all, this was a rare opportunity.

The young girl under the city was in the limelight and extremely sharp. No one could guarantee that she would succeed in going to the capital.

However, what if she succeeded?

This wager was still worth it for an old man who had lived for so long and this ancient and rich city.

"Of course."

Mormont did not disappoint him. He said to the people below, "Your Highness, other than the five thousand troops and five carriage gold coins I promised previously, I will also give the princess ten carriage weapons and the gold coins of the other ten carriages. These weapons and gold coins were left behind by the Lusni family. Since the princess defeated them, they should belong to the princess."

This was borrowing flowers to help Buddha. To the Carter army, this was definitely timely help.

If he did not have these things when he went to the capital, it would be difficult for him to fight other forces.

"Furthermore, Princess Carter, I can promise you that if you still need supplies in the future, be it food, weapons, or even gold coins, my Bingluo City will do our best to help you."

Mormont placed a huge bet again.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him in admiration. It seemed that this old man was pretending to be stupid at the beginning.

Carter rode his horse and stood quietly under the city wall. After a moment of silence, he raised his head and said, "I'm very grateful that Lord Mormont is so generous. The army can choose not to enter, but Lord Mormont must send those elves out."

Mormont smiled and said, "Princess, without these few elves, this city will probably still belong to the Lusni family. I won't force them. It's naturally good that they're willing to go out. If they're unwilling, there's nothing I can do."

Carter said coldly, "Then open the city gate. I'll go in personally to welcome them\! Don't worry, I'll only bring ten guards and not one more\! If Lord Mormont is still worried, I, Carter, can go in alone\!"

With that said, everyone was stunned.

Mormont looked at the youth beside him in surprise, then looked down and said, "Princess, you have the army and wealth now. Victory is in front of you, so why take the risk for a few elves? I can't guarantee that they won't hurt you."

Carter sneered. "They don't dare\!"

"Why?"

Mormont asked curiously.

Carter raised the sword in her hand and pointed at the youth on the city wall. She said coldly, "Because that man called Night is my man\!"

The moment this was said, the entire army was in an uproar.

Strange sounds came from the city wall.

This young elf was actually Queen Carter's man? Wasn't he just a boy? Did queens have strange habits?

Mormont was stunned. He turned to look at the youth beside him in disbelief and said, "Really?"

"It's fake\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately shouted, "She's lying\! Everyone, don't listen to her nonsense\! I'm innocent and clean with her\! I'm an elf, she's an orc, and I'm only her counselor. Furthermore, I'm a coerced counselor\!"

Carter roared angrily from below, "Are you going back on your word after eating everything? You slept with me many times and tortured me for many nights\! Don't you know? Not only did my subordinates see it, even the elves around you knew\! You even denied it\!"

"Ah…"

These words were like a thunderclap, shocking everyone again\!

The current Princess Carter had already become the Queen Carter. Tonight was the time to be in high spirits. The news of her self-destructing in front of so many people shocked everyone\!

"I… I didn't\!"

Chu Xiaoye was a little guilty. You clearly slept with me and tortured me, okay? Why should I be guilty?

"Let me ask you again, are you coming out or not?"

Carter said coldly.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked at the two fire dragons circling above him. Then, he looked down at her and said, "Carter, let's part peacefully. I don't like to see you kill people. Along the way, you will kill more people and even your family. Sorry, I have family too. They are in danger now. I have to save them as soon as possible. Therefore, I can't go with you anymore."

"Good\! Good\!"

Carter gritted his teeth and said good twice.

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief and thought that she would stop here.

Unexpectedly, this demoness suddenly raised the sword in her hand and said angrily, "Everyone, listen to my orders\! Attack the city immediately\! The first to break through the city gate will be the champion of my Carter subordinates\! After I officially ascend to the throne, this Bingluo City will be his reward\!"

"Long live the Queen\! Long live the Queen\!"

The nearly 70,000 army cheered excitedly. They immediately prepared their weapons and prepared to attack the city.

The thirty-thousand-strong army of the Lusni family was especially active. This was the best opportunity for them to gain the trust of the queen\!

On the city wall, Mormont's face was pale.

Everyone looked at the young elf.

"This is not my fault."

Chu Xiaoye spread his hands and explained guiltily.
