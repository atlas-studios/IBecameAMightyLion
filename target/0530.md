Chapter 530: Girl General

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye rushed down the hill like a bolt of lightning and instantly rushed in front of Fei'er. He drilled his head under Fei'er and carried her up. He shouted, "Catch it well\!"

Then, he turned around and ran. He suddenly jumped up the hill.

Under his control, the lion king's roar did not cause much harm to Fei'er. It only made the girl's eardrums buzz and she felt dizzy.

However, the circle of orcs at the front died directly.

Although the orcs behind were safe and wanted to chase after him, the ferocious beasts under them were terrified by the lion king roar and immediately fled in all directions. No matter how they shouted, it was useless.

Hence, the entire Orc cavalry was in chaos.

Many orcs were thrown down by their mounts and fell to the ground. They were trampled by other mounts again and died\!

Looking over, at the foot of the hill, there were figures of wild beasts running in panic and orcs rolling on the ground and crying out\!

The lion king roared and all the beasts were shocked\!

When Chu Xiaoye jumped over the border with Fei'er and came to the side of Lanisi and the others, before Fei'er could react, he lowered his body and turned into an elf youth.

The sudden transformation just now was unexpected even for him. He originally thought that he would have to rest for a few days before continuing to transform, but at that critical moment, he suddenly turned into a lion.

However, that roar just now almost exhausted all the energy in his body.

When he ran here, he could not hold on anymore and suddenly turned into an elf youth.

However, what puzzled him was that when his energy was exhausted, shouldn't he be beaten back to his original form? Was he always a lion?

But now, it was as if this young elf was his true form.

It seemed that this world was a true body, and the world he was in previously was only an illusory image. It did make sense.

In other words, this young elf was his true body and true form.

He still could not accept this absurd reality until now.

Fei'er fell to the ground and Lanisi helped her up.

The girl was still a little stunned and did not know what was happening. Her eyes were spinning and she could not stand steadily.

"Leave quickly\!"

Chu Xiaoye stood up naked.

Denise brought his clothes over and handed them to him. His sword was still at this tall girl's waist, and they looked more compatible.

As Chu Xiaoye ran, he quickly wore his clothes. He could not care less about being embarrassed and said quickly, "The orcs will not let the matter rest. We have to continue running until we alarm the people on Kast's side."

Lanisi and Denise supported Fei'er and hurriedly followed behind him.

Vilis carried the huge sword and finally recovered a little strength. She could only run while sweating again.

Soon, the orcs abandoned their mounts, leaned on their legs, and ran up the hill. They roared angrily on the hill, seemingly hesitating, not knowing if they should continue chasing.

However, the temptation of the Elven Queen was not small.

After hesitating for dozens of seconds, they rushed down the hill, crossed the border, and caught up.

They did not dare to roar anymore and only brandished the weapons in their hands, chasing after him with all their might.

Some orcs were timid and only dared to jump on the hill and curse, but they did not dare to rush down.

Hundreds of orcs rushed down the hill and entered Kast's borders, chasing after him at their fastest speed.

Denise let go of Fei'er and shot backward as she ran. Almost every arrow could defeat an orc, and her running speed was still very fast, as if she was a cavalryman fighting and retreating.

But soon, the arrows in her quiver were exhausted.

The orcs chased after him crazily, dust rolling and killing intent surging\!

"Clang\!"

Vilis suddenly pulled out the sword on her shoulder and stopped. She panted as she shouted, "I… I can't run anymore\! Go first, don't… don't care about me\!"

In this state, no matter how high her sword skills were, she would die for nothing.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye had already exhausted too much energy and stamina. He was powerless to help now.

Seeing hundreds of orcs surging over, the petite voice of the huge sword loli froze. He suddenly stopped and took the sword in Denise's hand. He turned around and said angrily, "Fight them\!"

Lanisi pulled out her sword and stood with him.

Denise pulled out the scimitar at her waist and handed it to Fei'er.

Fei'er had thrown her bow and dagger on the hill over there. She was still dizzy and could not even stand steadily, so how could she hold the knife?

She hurriedly said, "Sister Denise, protect Her Majesty. Don't worry about me. I… I can do it."

There were no more arrows in Denise's quiver. She could only walk to the Queen with her scimitar.

Right at this moment, the sound of thunder-like iron hooves suddenly came from behind\!

Then, a group of orcs wearing animal skin armor and riding horses roared and appeared from the distant horizon, running over quickly.

It was Kast's cavalry\!

The hundreds of orcs that were chasing with all their might were shocked when they saw this scene. They no longer cared about the Elven Queen's temptation and turned to run. They let out terrified cries, as if they were calling for their companions on the hill to save them.

However, when the orcs on the hill saw the Kast army running over, they did not dare to cross the line. They could only stand there and watch helplessly.

The Kast orc cavalry galloped close in the blink of an eye. They roared and rushed past Chu Xiaoye and the others, quickly charging towards the Bolton orcs that were running for their lives.

"Kill—"

How could an orc with two legs outrun a warhorse with four hooves that flew?

The Kast cavalry quickly caught up to the hundreds of Bolton Kingdom orcs. They did not show any mercy and swung the weapons in their hands, roaring as they slashed.

The hundreds of orcs hurriedly knelt on the ground and begged for mercy, but their heads were still cut off.

In the blink of an eye, the hundreds of Orcs of the Bolton Kingdom were covered in corpses and blood. They died cleanly.

The companions on their hill could only watch helplessly. They did not even have the courage to shout.

To those who crossed the line, this was a natural punishment.

Now, the army stationed at the border of the Bolton Kingdom had been mobilized and prepared to deal with the Elven Kingdom. This was definitely not the time for them to provoke the Kast Kingdom.

The thousands of Kast Kingdom cavalry surrounded the enemy's corpse, spurred their horses, and circled around. They let out victorious roars and whistled at the soldiers of the Bolton Kingdom on the hill, provoking and ridiculing them without restraint.

However, he did not get any firm response.

Then, the Kast cavalry formed a long team and walked towards Chu Xiaoye and the others, surrounding them in the middle.

"Eh, it's an elf?"

"Red hair, silver hair, and pink hair. They all look superior."

"Why are there still two little children? Look, this little girl is even carrying such a big sword. Could it be a hollow wooden sword?"

"Hahahaha…"

His teasing and ridicule immediately angered Lady Vilis.

Vilis panted as she held her sword and said angrily, "Do you want to try?"

This sentence made Kast's orc cavalry laugh again.

"This kid has a big temper. Hahahaha…"

"One look and you can tell that she's mature. Look at her chest. It's many times larger than your wife's chest."

"Hahahaha—F\*ck\! How do you know how big my wife's chest is? She never came to the camp at all\! When did you see her?"

Hence, the two Orc cavalry suddenly fought.

The other Orc cavalry at the side did not stop him. Instead, they laughed and watched, even continuing to encourage and jeer.

Suddenly, a team of cavalry galloped over and soon arrived nearby.

"The general has orders to bring these elves to the camp\!"

The moment that was said, the two fighting orcs immediately stopped.

"Go\!"

The orc cavalry raised their weapons and chased.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly had an ominous feeling.

Furthermore, this premonition grew stronger as they approached the orc army camp.

Soon, his premonition became reality.

When he arrived at the orc army camp and was escorted into a luxurious tent, he saw the orc girl with horns by her ears who had once said fierce words to him.

"Look, I said that we would meet again one day. I didn't lie to you, right?"

The orc girl sat behind the long table at the highest point and lay on an exquisite bench covered in tiger skin. She crossed her long and strong legs, tilted her head, and smiled at him very brightly.

Chu Xiaoye did not speak and thought of a solution.

The orc girl revealed a look of surprise. She sat up and looked at him. "Eh, what's wrong? Isn't your mouth very powerful? Every word is a curse and every word can stun me. What's wrong now? Are you mute?"

Chu Xiaoye knew that his and the other elven girls' lives were in this girl's hands. If he said anything wrong, he would definitely lose his life.

He suddenly said, "Is the general talking to me? This is the first time I'm meeting the general. Why is the mouth you mentioned so powerful?"

The orc girl was stunned for a moment. She stood up from the bench, then walked down the stairs and came in front of him. She blinked and stared at him for a while before saying, "Kid, are you pretending to be stupid?"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly shook his head and said, "I was stupid to begin with. Why should I pretend?"

With that said, he suddenly had a look of realization. "Right, General, I know\! You must have met my twin brother\! My brother looks identical to me and has a smelly mouth. He always likes to scold people. Furthermore, he doesn't repeat his cursing and can stun people\! You must have seen him\!"

The orc girl narrowed her eyes and leaned close to his face. She stared at his eyes and said, "Look, do I look like an idiot?"

Chu Xiaoye bit the bullet and said, "No."

The orc girl turned around and looked at the elven girls. She fixed her gaze on Lanisi and smiled. "Your Majesty, why are you in such a sorry state? The elves of the elven race are all like fairies. Look at you. You're covered in sweat, your hair is messy, and you look miserable. What's wrong?"

Lanisi pretended not to hear her ridicule and did not reply.

Vilis said coldly, "Carter, if you have the courage, let's fight again. How about that?"

The female general turned around and looked at her. She grinned and said, "Lady Vilis, I admit that my swordsmanship is not your match. However, my brain is not as stupid as yours. With a random word, your sword will leave you. Do you believe me?"

Vilis glared at her and said disdainfully, "Coward\!"

This provocation might be useful to others, but it was useless to this young female general.

Carter shrugged and admitted frankly, "Yes, I'm a coward. But so what? You're prisoners now, not cowards like me. Lady Vilis, please put down your pride. Otherwise, your life and your queen's life will be difficult to protect."

Vilis held her sword and glared at him, but she stopped talking.

Carter ignored her and turned to walk to the stairs. He lay on the bench again and looked at them. "I don't have a deep hatred for you. Back then, Lady Vilis let me go once, and a few days ago, you let me go again. Therefore, don't worry. I, Carter, am not so cold-blooded and heartless. I won't take your lives. However…"

Chu Xiaoye thought that he was doomed.

The female general looked at him and sneered. "This kid cursed me terribly that night. I can't take this lying down\!"

Chu Xiaoye could only take a step forward and cup his hands. "General, that's my brother\! My brother is dead. Now, I'll apologize to you on his behalf\!"

"Forget it\!"

The young female general sat up angrily again and looked at him coldly. "If you continue to pretend, I'll let Ha'er take off your pants and kill you on the spot\! Ha'er likes little boys like you who have tender skin and flesh."

The tall and sturdy man standing in a corner with a long knife immediately grinned and licked his lips. "Thank you, General."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the long horn on his head and his butt immediately turned cold. He hurriedly cupped his hands and said, "General, my mouth was cheap that night and I accidentally hurt you. I'm really sorry\! If you can't take it lying down, just scold me today. You can scold me a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand times. If I retaliate, I'll kill myself on the spot\!"

The female general immediately sneered and said, "An ugly person has a cheap mouth. I was right."

Chu Xiaoye immediately refused and hurriedly defended himself. "General, if you criticized me for not being able to do other things, I would have admitted it. But you can't say that I'm ugly. I'm so handsome, white and tender. How am I ugly?"

"Bam\!"

The female general slapped the table in front of her and stood up. She pointed at him and said angrily, "Are you still not going to talk back\! I just said something to you and you started\! Quickly die, or I'll pierce your mouth with my sword\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly covered his mouth and said, "General, calm down. This time, I swear that I won't talk back again."

"Clang\!"

Carter pulled out her sword and walked down the stairs to him. She sneered, "Open your mouth\! Let me see how long your tongue is\! How many swords are hidden in your mouth\!"

Vilis suddenly walked over and protected Chu Xiaoye. She looked at her coldly and said, "Carter, I'll play with you. Don't worry, I won't draw my sword and only use the sheath."

Carter narrowed her eyes and her brows started to twitch.

This was the sign of her anger.

Right at this moment, an orc suddenly rushed in from outside and reported, "General, General Mo Ya suddenly brought people and broke into the camp to find you. We really could not stop him."

"Mo Ya?"

Carter was stunned for a moment. He put away his sword and looked outside. Just as he was about to speak, a loud laugh came from outside.

Then, a slender orc youth who did not look like an orc strode in excitedly with a sword at his waist and golden hair. As soon as he came in, he said affectionately, "Carter, my dear fiancée, are you okay? This front line is not a place for a beautiful girl like you to stay. We're getting married next month. Aren't you going back? I asked His Majesty for a royal decree and came to pick you up personally."

As he spoke, the orc young man spread his arms and wanted to hug the female general. He looked very excited.

However, Carter suddenly took a few steps back, turned around, and walked up the stairs. She pointed at the seat below and said, "Mo Ya, you came from afar. Sit. There are some things that we can talk about when we return."

The orc youth was ignored, but he was not angry. Instead, his eyes became more and more infatuated. He smiled and said, "Carter, let's go back today. I've already told His Majesty that we're getting married next month. You have to go back and prepare in advance. At that time, we will invite many honorable foreign guests. If anything goes wrong, not only will we attract ridicule, other countries will also look down on our Kingdom of Kast."

Carter sat down on the bench and smiled politely. "There's no hurry. There are some things that need to be resolved here. Furthermore, I've already written a letter to His Majesty and will send it back tonight. Our marriage might have to be postponed."

The orc youth's expression changed and he said anxiously, "Delay the marriage? Carter, what's going on? Do you know how anxious I was when I heard that you suddenly fainted for a few days here? I rushed over immediately and did not even delay for a day on the way. My dear, you can't treat me like this."

Carter shrugged and picked up the red wine on the table. He raised his beautiful face and drank it in one gulp. Then, he looked at him and said, "Sorry, Mo Ya, I have to think of the big picture. I'm needed here. I can't leave for the time being."

The orc youth's expression suddenly turned gloomy.

He turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye and the others. He was stunned at first, but then he said in surprise, "Elves?"

Then, he suddenly looked enlightened and said, "Carter\! I know\! I also heard the news. The army at the border of the Bolton Kingdom has been transferred and seems to be preparing to attack the Elven Kingdom that should have been extinct long ago. Do you want to take this opportunity to lead the army to attack the border fortress of the Bolton Kingdom and reclaim our former city?"

With that said, he looked at Chu Xiaoye and the others beside him and narrowed his eyes. "These elves are here to ask for help from you, right? Carter, there's no need for us orcs to join forces with these elves. They are a species that should have been extinct long ago. Now that there are only a few left, how can they help us? What can they give us that's worth joining forces with?"

Carter looked at him solemnly and said, "Mo Ya, I'm the general here. Some things can be said, but some things, please shut up. I don't like my arrangements and plans to be leaked in advance."

Mo Ya was stunned for a moment before he nodded and said, "Alright, I understand."

Then, he suddenly pulled out the sword at his waist and pointed at Vilis, who was at the front. "Carter, kill these elves. In this way, no one will know about our conversation today."

Carter looked at him and was silent for a few seconds before saying, "Sure, but you can only kill the female elves. As for this kid, I'll do it myself."

Mo Ya suddenly looked at the only elf youth and revealed a dark expression. She sneered and said, "My dear fiancée, don't tell me you like this short elf?"

Carter picked up the wine pot and poured herself another drink. She picked it up and drank a few mouthfuls. Then, she looked at him and said calmly, "Yes, I like him."

Mo Ya was stunned for a moment, then gritted his teeth and roared angrily. He swung the sword in his hand and slashed at the elven girls, saying shrilly, "I want his life\!"

"Clang\!"

Vilis' sword blocked his sword and protected Chu Xiaoye.

The female general on the platform narrowed her eyes and revealed a hint of anger between her brows. She said, "Mo Ya, if you fight alone and kill this little elf, I'll go back with you immediately\!"

"Really?"

Mo Ya was overjoyed when he heard this and looked at her with a burning gaze.

Carter nodded and said, "Yes."

"Alright\!"

Mo Ya immediately pulled himself together, held his sword tightly, and suddenly slashed diagonally at Vilis' neck\!

Vilis moved back and easily dodged. She was not in a hurry to attack.

Mo Ya continued to slash and attack.

Carter stood on a high place with his hands behind his back. His amber eyes were not looking at the two sides of the battle. Instead, he was looking at the elven youth. Seeing that he was staring at Vilis nervously, the female general quietly clenched her fists and the anger between her brows grew stronger.

"Bang\!"

As soon as Vilis' Rotating Storm attacked, it sent Mo Ya and his sword flying and fell heavily on a table in the furthest corner, causing the table to fall to the ground.

Vilis did not continue attacking.

This was their territory. Since this orc young man was an important figure of Kast, no matter how simple-minded she was, she knew to stop when it was necessary.

She put away her sword and inserted it into the sheath.

Mo Ya, who had lost miserably, suddenly turned around and got up. In his anger, he roared angrily, swung the sword in his hand, and rushed over again\!

He was very fast in his anger. Like a ferocious beast, he jumped and pounced over.

Vilis, who had just put away her sword, was caught off guard. Just as she was about to draw her sword again, Chu Xiaoye, who was beside her, had already drawn his sword. With a clang, he received the orc youth's fierce attack.

The pitiful orc youth flew out again and fell heavily to the ground.

However, his physique was very good. After landing, he immediately turned around and got up. He glared at Chu Xiaoye and gritted his teeth. "Someone\! Drag this elf kid out and kill him\!"

On this trip, he brought fifteen guards with him. They were all experts and were loyal to him.

As soon as he gave the order, the fifteen guards immediately held the sword at their waists and rushed in from outside.

"Impudent\!"

The female general, who was standing high up, immediately reprimanded angrily. She raised her eyebrows and said, "Who let you in?"

Just as she finished speaking, the tall and sturdy orc standing in the corner raised the saber in his hand and cut off the head of the orc guard at the front with a whoosh.

Then, more tall and sturdy orcs suddenly surged in from outside. They were all the guards of the young female general and surrounded the remaining fourteen orc guards.

The muscles on Mo Ya's face twitched as he looked at his fiancée with a dark expression. He gritted his teeth and said, "Carter, you actually killed my guard? Just for this pretty boy with a milky smell?"

He found it unbelievable.

Carter walked down the stairs and came in front of him. She stared at him and said, "Mo Ya, please remember that this is my territory. I'm the general here\!"

Mo Ya said angrily, "But you're also my fiancée\!"

"Pfft\!"

Unexpectedly, just as he finished speaking, a dagger suddenly appeared in the girl's hand and she pierced it into his chest\!

Then, the female general leaned close to his face and said, "Not anymore."

Mo Ya opened his mouth, bulged his eyes, and trembled as he slowly knelt on the ground.

"Why… why?"

He did not dare to believe that this was even more terrifying than a nightmare.

Of course, the others here were also stunned by this scene. Who dared to believe it?

Wasn't this a couple that was about to enter the marriage hall?

The female general took a handkerchief from his waist, wiped her hands, and threw it in his face before turning to leave.

She walked in front of Chu Xiaoye and suddenly leaned close to the young elf's ear. She whispered, "Smelly fart king, I didn't expect you to be so lecherous after becoming an elf. Did you trick these little elves into coming to the harem? Did you play with them like how you played with me in the past?"

Her amber eyes revealed a hint of ridicule and coldness.

Chu Xiaoye's body suddenly trembled and he looked at her with his eyes wide open\!

The female general grinned and looked at the elf girls. Then, she turned around and walked up the stairs. She said coldly, "Ha'er, kill them all."
