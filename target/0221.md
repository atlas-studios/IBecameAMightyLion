Chapter 221: The White Lion Sisters

The white lioness seemed to have sensed something.

She turned around and looked at them. Her gaze was cold and dignified, but she was not flustered or nervous. She looked very calm, as if she did not care about this team.

The mixed fur lion and the lions were immediately woken up by her gaze.

They immediately lowered their heads in respect and fear, not daring to look at her impudently again.

Even if this was not a snow mountain, with their strength, they were definitely not a match for this white lioness.

Furthermore, the other party was a lioness who protected her cubs.

The white female lion was tall and larger than the mixed fur lion king. She looked dignified and domineering, and her entire body emitted the powerful aura of a superior.

The white fox brought the team and walked in another direction.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and saw that the white lioness was still standing in place, looking at them coldly.

The three young cubs had curious expressions.

Beside him, Catherine looked at him, her dark eyes trembling.

Was he tempted too?

In the valley ahead, a green grassland appeared.

On the grass, there were two snow-white female lions playing happily.

They looked very young, like sisters.

When the white fox brought the team close, they stopped playing and stood up, looking at the pride with a burning gaze.

There were a total of three prides and more than ten lions alone.

However, there were only two white female lions here.

Obviously, the snow mountain was more strict with the genes of lions.

When the two white female lions looked over, Chu Xiaoye could clearly see the mixed fur lion king standing in front of him. Its butt was twisting and its limbs were trembling. It was so excited that it almost could not stand steadily.

Although the three lions behind the lion king knew that they had no hope, they could not help but be excited. They lowered their heads and wagged their tails, their bodies trembling.

The other lions were naturally the same.

According to the previous few choices, Chu Xiaoye felt that these two lucky lions who were chosen must be from the three lion kings.

The mixed fur lion king still had hope.

The two young white female lions were not in a hurry to walk over and choose. Instead, they observed the three prides carefully, their gazes not letting go of any lion.

When their gazes landed on Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, who was beside him, stared at them coldly.

The other lions, be it the lions or the lionesses, all lowered their heads respectfully when the two white female lions observed them. Only she still raised her head and looked at them fearlessly and with hostility.

Hence, she seemed so striking.

The two white female lions saw her at first glance. They were stunned at first, but then they sized her up playfully.

The surroundings were silent.

The two white female lions stared at Catherine, and Catherine also stared at them.

"Whooshâ€”"

One of the female lions suddenly rushed over with lightning speed\!

She suddenly jumped over the lion king and the three lions and pounced at Catherine.

Catherine's gaze turned cold and she flicked her claws.

However, before she could jump up to face the enemy, Chu Xiaoye, who was beside her, suddenly flashed and jumped up first. With a bang, he collided with the white lioness from the side\!

Chu Xiaoye's head hit the white female lion's back from the side hard, causing the huge white female lion to fly to the side\!

The white lioness was caught off guard, but just as she was about to fall to the ground, she quickly stabilized her body and landed steadily.

She turned her head and looked at the young lion with a burning gaze.

She was not angry, but a little surprised.

The air instantly froze.

Even the white fox at the front was shocked.

The mixed fur lion king and the other lions were shocked and looked at this daring young lion in shock.

Another white female lion's eyes flickered and the claws on her feet could not help but show.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of Catherine and looked at the white lioness lion that was about to attack Catherine without showing any weakness. He grinned and bared his two sharp fangs.

They came to the snow mountain to help, not to be beaten\!

No matter how noble the status and identity of these white female lions were, they could forget about touching his sister\!

At most, they would leave the snow mountain and return to the grassland.

He had raised Catherine since she was young. Although her relationship with him was not as deep as that of Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, she was still his family.

He would not allow anyone to bully his people\!

This white female lion was clearly bullying the lion a little too much. She attacked without saying a word. Did she really think that they were slaves that could be beaten and killed at will?

"Roarâ€¦"

At this moment, another white female lion walked over and let out a provocative growl. Her flickering gaze was clearly a little excited, as if she was a martial fanatic who had encountered an interesting opponent.

The first white lioness that Chu Xiaoye knocked away could only take a few steps back helplessly when she saw this scene, as if she was saying, "Alright, I'll let you have this kid."

She was her sister, Alice.

As for the white lioness cub that had been fighting since she was young, it was her younger sister, Wei Li.

Although the two sisters looked tall and strong, they were only one and a half years old.

They did not come here to reward these victors. Instead, they were curious about these lions on the grassland and wanted to test their strength.

Alice had just attacked the lioness cub that dared to look her in the eye. She only felt that the other party's aura was not bad and wanted to test his skills.

Wei Li seemed to be impatient.

She took a few steps forward and suddenly roared angrily, telling the mixed fur lion king and the other lions standing in front to scram to the side.

The lion king trembled in fear and hurriedly lowered its head and wagged its tail. It let out a begging growl, as if it was pleading for Chu Xiaoye.

"Bang\!"

However, Wei Li ignored him. Just as she walked in front of him, she swung her right claw and slapped him flying\!

They could not withstand a single blow\!

The two sisters were very disappointed when they saw this scene.

Since this lion king was so weak, then even if this kid in the other party's pride had some ability, he could not be that strong.

It seemed that they had come for nothing today.

Although the three lions behind the mixed fur lion king were trembling in fear, they still stood in place and did not leave.

Wei Li looked at them with surprise and confusion.

Why did she suddenly feel that the mixed fur lion did not seem to be the lion king of this pride?

Be it the mixed fur or the three lions, they seemed to be protecting the daring kid behind them. This made her a little suspicious.

However, she soon knew.

"Whoosh\!"

She suddenly jumped up, swung her sharp claws, and pounced mercilessly at the young lion in front of her\!

The way this kid hit her sister just now looked a little interesting. She hoped that he would not be as weak as a chicken like that mixed fur\!
