Chapter 354: Untitled

 Whoosh\! 

A figure shot over\!

Just as the savage pounced in front of Chu Xiaoye and was about to punch him, Catherine arrived in a flash and suddenly pounced on the wild man's back, opening her mouth to bite his neck\!

"Roar —"

Before her sharp teeth could close, the savage suddenly roared and threw a backhand punch. With a bang, it hit her head and sent her flying.

Catherine fell heavily to the ground and struggled for a few times before stopping.

When the savage turned around and prepared to continue pouncing on Chu Xiaoye, Chu Xiaoye had already disappeared from where he was.

The savage was stunned for a moment before his expression changed. He threw a punch to the right with a bang\!

"Bang\!"

A rock that was flying over was shattered\!

At the same time, Chu Xiaoye, who was hiding behind a rock and shooting over, suddenly appeared and grabbed the savage's face\!

The savage could not dodge in time and could only quickly raise his huge foot and kick out\!

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw pierced through the wildling's face and into the muscles on his face. Just as he was about to continue stabbing into the bones, the huge foot had already roared over\!

Chu Xiaoye could only give up and suddenly jump back. With a whoosh, his golden claws tore off a piece of the savage's face\!

"Roar —"

The savage kicked empty air. His face was covered in blood and his face was distorted from the pain. He roared endlessly and jumped up from the ground.

Chu Xiaoye succeeded in his attack and quickly retreated. He came to Catherine's side and lowered his head to check on her injuries.

Catherine seemed to have sensed his aura and her body trembled slightly. She slowly opened her eyes and looked at him with difficulty. Blood flowed out of her mouth and nose.

Chu Xiaoye reached out with his trembling claws and rubbed her head. Then, he suddenly turned around and looked at the miserable savage.

"Whoosh\!"

He rushed over at lightning speed.

At this moment, Tilly was waving her golden claws and killing in the group of chimpanzees\!

The black gorilla that was holding the little girl hostage had already been knocked to the ground by the roars of the savage. Now, it stood up again and picked up the little girl that was preparing to escape.

When Chu Xiaoye rushed towards the savage like a bolt of lightning, the savage roared and rushed towards him.

"Bang\!"

Their bodies suddenly collided and let out the sound of bones breaking. Then, they separated from each other and took a few steps back.

Chu Xiaoye's head buzzed, but he was fine.

As for the savage's chest, a portion of it was dented. A few ribs seemed to have been broken.

He stood in place, his body trembling slightly. He bit his fangs and his face twitched, as if he was enduring intense pain.

Just as Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to pounce over again, the savage suddenly opened its mouth, widened its eyes, and contracted its abdomen. "Roar—" It let out a deafening and extremely terrifying roar\!

His face distorted and the little tongue in his mouth swayed crazily. His mouth opened wider and wider\!

Chu Xiaoye, who had just pounced in front of him, suddenly felt a terrifying airflow slap over like a monstrous wave and sent him flying\!

"Ugh —"

He suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood and flew more than ten meters away. His heart seemed to have been shaken by this terrifying roar until it suddenly started beating crazily. For a moment, his soul was in chaos, his head was dizzy, and his internal organs seemed to be trembling\!

He fell heavily to the ground, blood flowing from his mouth and nose. His entire body was limp and he continued to withstand the aftershock of this roar.

Catherine, who was lying on the ground, fainted.

Tilly, who was fighting, suddenly tilted and fell to the ground.

The remaining chimpanzees also fell to the ground and roared in pain.

The black gorilla holding the little girl spat out a mouthful of blood. As if it was drunk, it took a few crooked steps forward and fell to the ground with a bang.

The roars continued\!

One could even see a circle of airflow ripples spreading out from the savage's open mouth and quickly spreading out.

The huge rocks around him actually cracked and cracked open, revealing cracks.

Many dust and stone fragments attached to it flew up and drifted into the distance\!

Just as this roar continued to pierce Chu Xiaoye's eardrums and enter his brain, destroying his soul, a fragrant wind suddenly swept past him. Two small and soft fingers suddenly stuffed into his ear and blocked it for him.

The terrifying trembling instantly stopped\!

His heart, which had almost jumped out of his chest, gradually calmed down.

The consciousness that was shaken to who knows where quickly woke up.

The little girl lay beside him and blocked his ears with two fingers. Her cold and tender face was tightly pressed against his face. She was crying and saying blurry words.

The savage's roar finally stopped.

However, his body swayed and he staggered before falling to the ground. Blood flowed from his mouth and nose.

However, he soon got up.

He opened his mouth and let out an ear-piercing grin. His face was badly mutilated and he looked like a devil that had just crawled out of hell. He was extremely ferocious.

He swayed and walked towards Chu Xiaoye, muttering.

"I won… I won… I'm the king, I'm the hero\!"

He seemed to be talking to the little girl or Chu Xiaoye. His huge feet made banging sounds on the ground.

He came in front of Chu Xiaoye and slowly raised his fist. The smile on his face was even more ferocious and terrifying.

The little girl suddenly got up and screamed. She pulled out the knife at her waist and stabbed at his abdomen. However, just as it pierced through his fur, it was clamped in his muscles and she no longer had the strength to stab it in.

The savage let out a low growl and grabbed her golden hair, lifting her up. He stared at her angrily and resentfully, as if he was questioning her why.

The little girl struggled hard, pulled out her knife, and swung it at him with all her might, but she could not stab him.

The muscles on the savage's face twitched a few times, and a fierce look flashed in his eyes. He suddenly extended his other big hand and grabbed her neck\!

Just as he was about to crush the little girl's throat, golden light suddenly flashed in front of him\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw suddenly shot over and pierced through his neck. With a whoosh, it tore his entire head off\!

Blood sprayed and his head fell to the ground\!

The headless corpse stood in place, still strangling the little girl's neck, but it could not use any more strength.
