Chapter 276: Giant Crocodile in the River

The dignity of a lion king could not be violated.

In order to not let the cold father be too embarrassed and feel like dying, Chu Xiaoye immediately brought everyone back quietly and pretended to not see anything.

The cold father's thoughts were all on the fruits on the ground and did not realize that his children had seen the scene of his image collapsing.

Belita jumped on the tree and helped him eat fruits.

Belia played with him from below, teaching him to shake his head and swing his butt, doing all sorts of comical and strange actions.

The cold father gradually immersed himself in it and became higher and higher. He was so high that he could not extricate himself and felt that his lion life had reached its climax.

Until evening.

When Chu Xiaoye was about to bring the members of the pride to the river to drink water, the cold father walked back with his head held high and a dignified expression.

He looked at everyone and walked proudly to the grassland at the side to lie down. He did not intend to go to the river with them to drink water.

He was no longer thirsty.

However, Chu Xiaoye stood in place with the other members, staring at him uniformly and waiting for him.

Little Curly Tail walked over with a faint smile. He wagged his tail and swayed in front of him, letting out mocking cries.

Just like how he cried out in pleasure when he ate the sour fruit previously.

"Didn't you say that you were very thirsty this morning? Could it be that you've already secretly drank water in the forest?"

Little Curly Tail was asking the obvious.

The cold father panicked and hurriedly stood up. He licked his lips, indicating that he had yet to drink water. He definitely did not eat those strange things in the forest\!

"Let's go and drink water. This King is indeed a little thirsty."

He immediately strode forward and walked in front of Little Curly Tail, looking calm and dignified.

Thinking of his comical appearance previously and looking at him pretending to be dignified, Little Curly Tail tugged at the corner of his mouth and swayed as he laughed until he could not walk steadily.

"This unfilial son\! Are you mocking me for not daring to drink water by the river?"

The cold father turned around and looked at him angrily.

The bushes were only about a kilometer away from the river.

Over the past two days, wandering lions that had lost their homes came here one after another.

Some formed groups, some were alone, and some brought young cubs. Most of them were very vigilant and fierce. At first, they did not believe them and were very aggressive.

Therefore, this seemingly short journey actually hid many dangers.

In order to gather these wandering lions, Chu Xiaoye sent out the mixed fur few to assist Lars and One-eyed.

After all, they were tall, strong, more convincing, and dignified. They could also deal with those ferocious wandering lions at any time.

This territory had just been built. They could only defend first and stabilize the entire team. They could let the female lions at the back feed the cubs better and let more homeless lions join them to obtain more combat strength.

Only in this way could they reclaim the grassland.

If he left this place with his only combat strength now and went to fight those black lions, he would probably be wiped out before he could win the battle.

Furthermore, he was not so arrogant that he thought that they could defeat the entire black lion tribe with their little combat strength.

The reason why they won the first battle that night was not because they were strong, but because there were no strong characters among the hundred-over black lions.

If he encountered a mutant as strong as the black lion king last time and brought more black lions, he, Catherine, and the others would be doomed, no matter how powerful they were.

In a large-scale war, the courage of a few members could not determine the outcome.

Therefore, they had to conserve their energy, strengthen their strength, and plan slowly.

He did not want the team that he had painstakingly gathered to be destroyed by his blind arrogance before it could be of use.

These members had survived through all sorts of hardships. He had to be responsible for them and not let them die for nothing.

"Roarâ€”"

An angry roar interrupted his thoughts.

On the hill near the river stood a few young lions. Their fur was messy and their bodies were thin. Because they had not had the time to rest after a long journey, their eyes were filled with red threads and they looked extremely haggard.

There were a total of five lions and they looked like cousins in a pride.

At this moment.

When they saw Chu Xiaoye's team, they immediately bared their fangs and let out fierce roars.

The cold father finally found a sense of existence and immediately roared angrily. He walked in front majestically and looked fiercely at this group of invaders who had trespassed his territory.

The five lions looked at his lush mane and strong body. Although they were a little panicked, they still bared their teeth and roared, standing side by side.

They only passed by here and wanted to continue forward.

No matter what, they would never look back. The terrifying scenes and the groups of black devils had already terrified them and they did not dare to return to the grassland again.

They wanted to escape to the edge of the grassland and into the forest.

Because they knew that this grassland, including this place, would be occupied by those black devils, and the pride living here would be cruelly slaughtered like their father and mother.

The cold father walked forward and was about to flaunt his might and ask questions when the five young wandering lions immediately roared angrily and pounced forward together.

The cold father was caught off guard and stood in place in a daze, as if he had forgotten to resist.

His pampering and the respect the other lions had for him during this period of time made him confident that no lion would dare to be impudent to him in front of his unfilial son.

Therefore, he was not prepared at all.

Fortunately, Little Curly Tail was behind him. When he saw this scene, he swung his tail and swept the five tired and hungry lions to the ground with a single move, chewing on a mouthful of mud.ã€�

"Roarâ€”"

The cold father finally woke up and was furious. He immediately roared angrily and pounced forward, biting the neck of a wandering lion, erupting with the anger of a lion king\!

Just as he was about to fly into a rage out of humiliation and bite the neck of this blind lion, Chu Xiaoye walked in front of him and slapped his head to make him let go.

The cold father glared and let go.

At this moment, Lars, who had just returned, heard the roar and rushed over with the blue eyes.

Lars had been running around busily these few days and almost never rested. Furthermore, he did not look tired at all and was still serious and engrossed.

Chu Xiaoye saw this and his impression of this big brother changed greatly.

The other members of the pride of the cold father also changed their attitude towards this former family member and companion.

Even Little Curly Tail, who always liked to tease him, did not find trouble with him again.

Chu Xiaoye handed the five young wandering lions to this big brother for him to handle.

Under the threat of the blue eye's huge body and strong aura, the five thin wandering lions almost fell to the ground in fear and could not stand up. They did not dare to resist.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride of the cold father and walked down the hill to drink water by the river.

When Lars and the blue-eyed man left with the five wandering lions, Little Curly Tail leaned in front of his brother and asked him somewhat aggrievedly why he was so good to Lars and why he handed such a good job to Lars and not him.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and walked straight to the river.

He could not tell him "Because this task is too difficult for you to do".

Lars had been expelled from the pride very early on and had always lived a wandering life with no guarantee of survival. He had experienced many ups and downs. Now that he was given such an important task, he would definitely cherish and treat it seriously.

Little Curly Tail was different.

Chu Xiaoye knew how playful his younger brother was. It would be fine if you let him do it for a day or two. If he continued to do it, he would lose his patience in a few days and mess up many things. He might even ignore his image and go around fighting.

Now that the team had just been established, the morale of the army looked stable, but there were still many unknown changes. He did not want this kid to mess things up.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was lowering his head to drink water, a bloody mouth full of fangs suddenly jumped out from the water and bit his head\!

It was a huge crocodile that was five meters long\!

Before Chu Xiaoye could extend his claws to slap, Little Curly Tail's tail had already flown out with a whoosh and instantly wrapped around the huge crocodile's mouth\!

Then, Little Curly Tail swung his butt and suddenly swung his tail forcefully, causing the huge crocodile to fly up and land heavily on the shore.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, just as the giant crocodile landed on the ground, its tail suddenly swayed and actually slapped the cold father standing on the shore, sending him flying. With a whoosh, he fell into the river.

Little Curly Tail and the other members were stunned.

The water level of the river was already very high and flowing downstream. The cold father had just fallen in and disappeared.

At the same time, on the water not far away, a few giant crocodiles heard the noise and immediately sank into the water, swimming quickly towards the place where the cold father fell.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately jumped down and sank into the water.

He saw the cold father at a glance.

At this moment, the cold father's eyes were wide open. He raised his body and was floating downstream. His limbs were struggling violently, but he could not float up. Clearly, he was injured by the tail of the giant crocodile just now.

Not far ahead, there were a few giant black shadows swimming quickly towards him against the water\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly held his breath and swam over quickly.

He was anxious and uneasy.

The few crocodiles had now become extremely ferocious giant crocodiles. They were originally the overlords of the water, and now, they must have become even stronger and more terrifying. Perhaps he was not afraid on the shore, but at the bottom of the water, he really could not resist them.

He could not even protect himself, let alone save the cold father.

Unfortunately, Tilly did not follow. Otherwise, with the female cub's water nature and strength in the water, there might be some hope.

"Whoosh\!"

When he quickly swam to the cold father's side, the few giant crocodiles also opened their bloody mouths and swam over excitedly.
