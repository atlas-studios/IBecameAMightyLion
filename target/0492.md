Chapter 492: My Name Is Night\!

"Whoosh\!"

This time, Vilis did not stand on ceremony and took the initiative to attack\!

She dragged the huge sword with both hands and ran a few steps. Her body suddenly spun and she jumped up. After spinning a few times in midair, she swung the huge sword in her hand and gathered strength. She raised it high and seemed to have pounced out with her, slashing at Chu Xiaoye's head\!

This strength and sharpness was not something that any flesh could withstand\!

However, Chu Xiaoye did not dodge\!

He decided to fight head-on\!

He jumped up, raised the golden claw in his hand, and faced it\!

A claw glint suddenly lit up on his golden claws and jumped on them like flames. They shone in his amber eyes, causing them to seem to be burning with two balls of flames, demonic and cold\!

Vilis was stunned for a moment.

"Clang—"

An ear-piercing metallic collision sounded, bringing with it a string of dazzling sparks\!

The huge sword in Vilis' hand suddenly trembled and she was sent flying while spinning. She was like a butterfly stuck to a fallen leaf that could not help but fly and land lightly.

Vilis fell to the ground and still did not stop.

She tiptoed like a girl dancing ballet. Her silver hair fluttered and her posture was beautiful. After the huge sword spun her a few times, she stood steadily.

A heavy force also came from Chu Xiaoye's claws.

The accumulated strength after the huge sword spun and combined with the elf's natural divine strength, sending him flying.

He landed on the ground and took a few steps back with a whoosh. After leaving a few clear marks on the grass, he stopped.

The claw light was extinguished, but the flames in his heart were still burning.

Indeed, he was born with a thirst for battle.

Just like all lions, they fought\!

"Whoosh\!"

The tip of his claw was ignited again. The flames in his heart burned and his fighting spirit was high. He decided to use this little fairy to show his true combat strength\!

However, the other party did not give him a chance.

"Deal\!"

Vilis picked up her huge sword from the ground and placed it on her shoulder, neatly agreeing to his condition.

However, the little elf still had a cold expression.

She turned around and stopped looking at him. She said to Annie, "Your Highness, we should go to the palace to see Her Majesty."

Annie was very happy. She went over and held her little hand. "Vilis, are you really willing to… leave them behind? Thank you. I hope that you won't lie to me again this time."

She was about to call Chu Xiaoye king again, but she immediately changed her mind.

Vilis did not turn around and said coldly, "Give him a name. It's best if it's simpler."

Annie was in a difficult position.

She did not know what name would not make her king feel insulted.

"Let's call it bald."

Vilis said.

Annie immediately objected, "No\! It's so ugly\!"

"You can call him Little Baldy too. He's quite cute."

Vilis turned away and blinked at her.

Annie shook her head again and said, "His fur will grow again. He won't be bald forever. He can't be bald."

"Where's the lion?"

Vilis asked again.

"This…"

Annie could not decide. She looked at her king.

Chu Xiaoye had no choice but to extinguish the flames in his heart. He walked forward, extended his claws, and wrote his name on the ground. However, he only wrote one word. "Night."

"Night?"

Annie was stunned for a moment before she immediately smiled. "It's very nice\! The King of the Night\! The night of all the enemies\!"

Alice pondered for a moment before nodding. "Alright, let's use this name."

Chu Xiaoye wrote Catherine's name on the ground again.

He had personally given this lioness cub a name.

"Catherine? Wow, this name sounds even better\!"

Annie clapped her hands and smiled at Catherine. "So you have such a nice name. You should have told me."

Catherine lowered her head slightly and looked at her king. Like a little girl who had been praised, she was a little shy and happy.

"Night, Catherine, wait here. You can walk around, but only in this garden."

After Vilis instructed, she carried the huge sword and left in a hurry with Annie.

They needed to go to the palace to see the Queen and inform Annie of something.

Princess Annie's return would definitely cause a storm in this city. If nothing unexpected happened, this storm would definitely spread out of the city.

At that time, that traitor would not be able to sit still.

"Hahahahahahahaha…"

Just as she walked out of the garden and closed the wooden door, Vilis suddenly laughed out loud without warning. She laughed until her flowers fluttered and her silver hair fluttered. Even the huge sword on her shoulder fell to the ground.

Annie, who was following at the side, was shocked and looked at her in shock.

Although she knew that this elf swordmaster's appearance was inferior and her personality was unpredictable, she did not expect her to suddenly laugh so crazily.

"Annie\! My dear Annie\! I like this mount you gave me\! I'm so happy that I'm about to explode\! Hahahahaha…"

Vilis hugged her shoulders and continued to laugh, as if she wanted her to laugh with her.

Annie laughed and reminded her, "Vilis, Night is not your mount."

"He is\!"

Vilis suddenly stopped laughing and looked at her with a burning gaze. She said with certainty and confidence, "If I say yes, he is\! Even if he isn't now, he will be in the future\! There's nothing that I, Lady Vilis, can't get\!"

Annie's expression became serious and she said seriously, "Vilis, listen to me. Perhaps in this city of elves, you can do whatever you want and obtain many things you want to make many elves submit. However, I can be sure that he won't. He's a king, a king on the grassland, an arrogant and arrogant king. Even if he dies, he will never be humiliated by you and be your mount. Believe me, Vilis, you can't make him submit willingly. You can only make friends with him and give him respect and trust. This is why he's willing to stay here and help you."

Vilis eyes flickered and she said coldly, "Be friends with a lion?"

Annie shook her head and said, "No, he's not just a lion. He knows how to write, communicate with me, and have all sorts of skills that you don't expect. He's also smart and even smarter than many humans. Most importantly, he's very strong and kind."

Vilis shrugged and said, "But I'm not good at making friends with beasts."

She bent down and picked up her huge sword from the ground, staring at the clear claw marks on the blade with a burning gaze. She suddenly raised her head and smiled at Annie. "Why don't I be his partner?"
