Chapter 562: The Great Scholar, Tang Yin

The light swayed.

The first couplet wrote: Idle people are not allowed to enter but the wise are.

Obviously, this couplet indicated that this young stall owner wanted to make friends with like-minded people.

Chu Xiaoye said, "A thief should not come but like-minded people should."

When the few young men who had stopped in their tracks heard this, they were immediately stunned. They did not expect this young man to really complete the couplet, and it was rather neat.

"Boss, is this gift okay?"

Chu Xiaoye pointed at the first gift.

"The thief should not come but like-minded people should… Good\! Very good\!"

The young stall owner immediately picked up the first gift and handed it to him. He praised with a smile, "Little Brother, you matched the couplet well."

Chu Xiaoye felt ashamed. He took the gift and stuffed it to the brat who was still hugging the table leg tightly. "Can we go now?"

Little Guai took it happily, but she still shook her head and said, "No\! Brother Chu is so powerful. You still have to help Little Guai win all these gifts, okay?"

"Sss… What arrogance\!"

When the young men heard this, they immediately sneered. It was bad enough that they completed a couplet, but they still wanted to complete them all? Did they think they were Tang Bolang, who was known for his ability to complete couplets among the four great talents of Suhang?

Chu Xiaoye looked at the second couplet: Shift the chair and enjoy the moon together.

This was difficult. The young men thought for a long time and could only shake their heads and sigh bitterly.

Qin Mo whispered beside Qin Yu and Qin Zhitan, "Even Brother can't match this couplet. The first three words and the middle two words sound the same. The first two words are verbs. Furthermore, this first half is extraordinary and is extremely difficult to match."

Chu Xiaoye said, "Light the lanterns and go to the pavilion to attack the books."

"Amazing\! Amazing\!"

The few young male scholars who had been sneering and waiting to see him fail immediately could not help but praise when they heard the second half.

This time, they no longer looked at this youth disdainfully.

The young stall owner picked up the second exquisite gift and handed it to Chu Xiaoye. He smiled and said, "Little Brother, this second half was written for us scholars. We read day and night and spend our lives immersed in books. This is the picture of a scholar."

Chu Xiaoye was a little ashamed, but he did not dare to agree.

Most people in the ancient times did not read for the sake of reading, let alone be immersed in books. Most of them read to study for tests and to become government officials.

The mental state of the young stall owner in front of him seemed to be completely different from that of other scholars.

"Brother Chu\! You're so powerful\! You're much stronger than my brother\!"

Little Guai took the second gift and was so happy that her nose was bubbling. She finally let go of the table leg and pointed at the third gift. "Brother Chu\! I want more\!"

Qin Zhitan, who was beside her, hurriedly said with a dark face, "Nonsense\! Your Brother Chu is a guest and not your servant\! Don't be stubborn\!"

Little Guai pouted and was about to cry again.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "Uncle Qin, it's okay. Just one more. Little Guai, this is the last one. You can't ask for more okay?"

Little Guai immediately smiled through her tears and nodded. "Yes, the last one\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the third couplet: A Confucian scholar like yourself brings a three-word couplet to meet a top-ranked official like me and dares to call me your brother?

This couplet's tone was arrogant and did not seem to be done by this young man. Or was it the young stall owner's self-deprecation? Presumably, his former schoolmate or brother had already soared. As for him, he had gone to see the other party but was rejected.

Qin Mo looked at the couplet and was about to explain it to her brother and father in a low voice when Chu Xiaoye already said, "After walking a thousand miles and reading ten thousand books, a commoner can also be prouder than a noble\!"

When the couplet was completed, not only were the young male scholars stunned, the young stall owner in front of him suddenly looked at him in shock.

It was fine if it was completed neatly, but this aura immediately made them feel proud and excited. They could not calm down for a long time\!

Qin Mo also stood there in a daze. Her mouth was slightly open as she looked blankly at this young guest.

"Boss, this third gift…"

Fortunately, it was night and Chu Xiaoye hid his blushing.

He only had a good memory.

"Young Master is so talented and imposing\! Impressive\! Impressive\!"

The young stall owner praised as he handed him the third gift. Then, he cupped his hands and said, "I'm Tang Bolang of Suhang. May I be friends with you?"

"What\! Tang Bolang? He's actually Tang Bolang?"

"The leader of the four great talents of Suhang, Tang Bolang?"

When the young man heard this name, his jaw almost fell from shock.

With their current unknown talents, they were not even qualified to participate in the Scholarly Meeting, let alone see this famous great talent of Suhang\!

He did not expect to encounter them here tonight\!

Qin Mo also had a shocked and excited expression. This great talent of Suhang, was the idol her brother respected and admired the most. Unfortunately, her brother was not here, or he would definitely be crazily happy.

Chu Xiaoye saw that everyone was very excited to hear this name and knew that this was a famous person. However, he had never liked famous people, let alone that he had never heard of them.

"So it's Brother Tang. Nice to meet you."

Chu Xiaoye also cupped his hands and bowed, but he did not say his name. He hurriedly handed the gift in his hand to Qin Xiaoye and said, "Alright, Little Guai, we should go look for your brother."

Little Guai was happy and said, "Yes, Brother Chu, Brother will definitely like you."

Tang Bolang froze in place, feeling a little embarrassed.

Did he never hear his name before at all, or was he arrogant and unwilling to care about him?

Qin Mo hurriedly walked to Chu Xiaoye's side and reminded him in a low voice, "Young Master Chu, this Young Master Tang is the number one talent in Suhang now. He is the person my brother admires the most."

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at her and said in confusion, "So what? Do you want an autograph?"

"Huh???"

Qin Mo was dumbfounded.

Chu Xiaoye held Little Guai's hand and left quickly.

Lanisi and the others wrapped their headscarves and followed behind.

Fei'er could not help but whisper, "Your Majesty, I didn't expect Lord Night to be so talented. We really picked up a treasure."

Beside him, Vilis snorted coldly and said disdainfully, "What do you mean by talented? This is a small trick used to seduce ignorant girls\!"

"Brother Chu\! Brother Chu\! Wait a moment\!"

The great talent named Tang Bolang actually abandoned his stall and hurriedly chased after him.

Chu Xiaoye could only stop and turn to look at him. "Brother Tang, I'll stay in Suhang for a few days and leave soon. It's not impossible to make friends with you, but it will definitely not be useful to you."

Tang Bolang came in front of him while panting and said with a smile, "Brother Chu, what do you take me, Tang Yin, as? When I make friends, I don't care about their birth, age, or future. I only ask if I was happy back then. I treat Brother Chu like I've known you for a year. Even if you leave tomorrow and turn around and don't know me, I still want to make friends with Brother Chu tonight\!"

Tang Yin?

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. He stared at him for a few seconds before saying, "Did you raise a cockroach called Little Qiang in your family?"

Tang Bolang was stunned and said in shock, "Cockroach? Can that thing be raised too?"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the shoulder and smiled. "I'm joking. Alright, since Brother Tang is so open and honest, let's be friends\! There are some things I still have to ask Brother Tang for advice on."

Tang Bolang immediately beamed and said repeatedly, "No, no, no. Brother Chu, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. However, there are many people here and it's very noisy. It's not a place to talk. Let's go on the ship. There's a scholarly meet being held there. We'll listen to beautiful women playing the guzheng, drink wine, and talk about the world's matters. Wouldn't that be beautiful?"

"Scholarly Meet?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the luxuriously decorated double-story ship hanging with lanterns on the Qinhuai River.

Little Guai hurriedly jumped in joy and said, "Alright\! Get on the ship\! Get on the ship\! Little Guai has never been on such a ship\! Brother is definitely on it too. We can go find Brother\!"

The expressions of Qin Zhitan and Qin Yu, who were following behind, changed.

How could merchants like them go to such a place? Furthermore, children could not go.
