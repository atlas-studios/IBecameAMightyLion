Chapter 472: The Bald Lion King

The fierce battle lasted for a long time.

What disappointed Chu Xiaoye was that the green pterosaur did not seem to be able to spray flames and burn the enemy alive like in the legends.

It could only use its claws and sharp teeth to fight enemies.

However, this barbaric and violent method of attack was not too ideal for poisonous bees that won in numbers and were not too big.

Fortunately, the defense of the armor on its body was not bad and its immunity to bee venom was about to be reduced. Therefore, after blocking for a while, it could still retreat calmly and return to the nest on the main branch of the giant tree.

To Chu Xiaoye's surprise, the furious poisonous bee army did not chase after them, as if they were afraid of something.

The victory of the poisonous bee army could not restore their beehives to their original state, nor could they bring back the young bees and queen bees that had fallen to the ground and were eaten by all sorts of insects and poisonous creatures.

They could only turn their grief into strength and rebuild their homes.

At this moment, the culprit, Chu Xiaoye, was still lying motionless on the branch, waiting for them to leave.

At the same time, he was feeling pleased with himself. This was the outcome of you bullying This King\!

However, the poisonous bee army did not seem to have any intention of leaving, nor did they have the intention to find a better place to build their nest.

They were still preparing to build their nests here.

Furthermore, they liked the fur on Chu Xiaoye's body.

Even if it was not golden.

"Buzz…"

The poisonous bee army came.

"Buzz…"

The poisonous bee army left again.

Chu Xiaoye was like a pitiful worm whose clothes had been stripped off. All his fur was stripped clean and not a single strand was left.

He lay there bare, trembling in the cold wind and feeling sad under the setting sun, sad for his lost youth and his lost handsomeness.

The green pterodactyl hid in the nest to heal. The poisonous bee army was busy building the nest.

The sun finally set.

After the sky turned dark, their vision would be blocked.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and left carefully.

If he did not leave now, he could forget about leaving forever.

The poisonous bees blocked the way to rob him and the wyvern guarded the fortress. The exploration mission ended here.

After walking to the spot where he had jumped up previously, he took a deep breath and jumped down.

Although his clothes were removed, he was still agile and agile.

He landed steadily on the canopy of the big tree below, causing the canopy to sway left and right.

He saw Catherine, who had been waiting here, and also Alisa, who was sleeping with her eyes narrowed. Just as he stabilized himself and was about to greet her, the two figures had already pounced over very enthusiastically.

Then, with two bangs, she slapped him heavily on the face.

They treated this bare young lion king as a monster that had fallen from the sky.

Chu Xiaoye fell from the canopy in a sorry state. His sadness and shame did not make him lose his composure. His sharp claws agilely grabbed the extended branch. After swinging in the air a few times, he landed steadily on the ground with a whoosh.

This was originally a smooth and handsome move, but to the naked lion king, he would no longer get such praises.

He was so ugly that he did not even dare to look at himself and think again.

He stood on the ground, raised his head, and stuck out his chest, trying his best to still have the might and dignity of a lion king.

His mane was no longer there and his body was stripped bare, but he was still the powerful and confident lion king\!

"Roar—"

He raised his head and roared, telling the two blind women on the canopy, "I'm your king\! Your lion\! Your supreme leader\! Get down and kowtow to admit your mistakes\!"

Actually, Catherine had recognized him when he slapped her. However, she did not have the time to retract her claws and was so shocked that she almost killed him.

Alisa was the first to jump down from the tree. She widened her eyes and looked at the bare fellow in front of her as if she was looking at a monster, her face filled with shock and disbelief.

She seemed to be asking, "What's wrong with you? Where's your fur?"

Catherine also jumped down. Although she was very shocked and shocked by his current appearance, she was still loyal to him. She was very sorry for her claw just now. She immediately lowered her head and lay on the ground to admit her mistake.

"S-Sorry, I was wrong…"

She was like a little girl who had done something wrong.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye would not mind her unintentional mistake, but he did not have such a good expression towards Alisa, who refused to admit her mistake and had a strange expression.

"Get down\! Apologize\!"

He widened his eyes in anger and glared at the proud and annoying lioness cub in front of him.

Alisa did not seem to see his anger. She still widened her eyes and curiously asked why he had become like this.

"Where's your fur? Where's your fur? Why did it fall off? Could it be that someone pressed it against the tree and pulled it out?"

They were questioning and mocking him.

The corner of his mouth twitched and he looked like he could not help but laugh, although he was still trying his best to hold it in.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and stuck out his chest, showing extreme calm and composure. He looked at her sideways, as if he was looking at a bumpkin that had popped out from some corner and used his disdain for her to hide his embarrassment.

"The weather is hot. This King wants to change his hairstyle and clothes. Why? It's none of your business\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to talk to her anymore. He turned around and left, returning to the camp.

He used his calm steps and cold expression to hide the anxiety and embarrassment in his heart. These two female lions were easy to deal with, but there were still more companions in the camp.

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly sounded from the bushes in front of him\!

Then, Little Curly Tail bared his fangs and jumped out of the bushes majestically, revealing a fierce face. "Where did this bald monster come from? Get lost\!"

Although this kid was loyal and a good kid, as his brother and king, Chu Xiaoye could not help but slap him.

Alisa, who was following behind, immediately fell to the ground, cracked her mouth, and laughed until her limbs twitched.

God knew where she learned this laughter from.

Seeing her open her limbs and laugh without restraint, Chu Xiaoye fiercely decided that he would make her wail until dawn tonight\!

Little Curly Tail seemed to have become a stone sculpture and suddenly stood there in a daze. Only when Chu Xiaoye walked far away did he suddenly roar and exclaim, "Oh my god\! That's my brother? Damn it, what made him look like that?"

Chu Xiaoye returned to the camp and tried his best to appear calm.

Before anyone could ask, he took the initiative to twist his body and showcase his good figure to everyone with a flaunting and pleased expression. "Do you see this? This is the newly popular hairstyle and clothes this year. Is it cool? Is it cool? Little companions who want to be as cool as me, feel free to tell me. I'll help you fulfill your wish."

However, all the members looked at him in shock, silent.

The atmosphere was terrifyingly awkward.

"Hahahahahaha…"

Right at this moment, an ear-piercing laughter suddenly came from above.

The human little girl lay on the ground like Alisa, holding her stomach and laughing hysterically.

The big black bear, who was originally in a daze, was immediately infected. It also held its stomach and lay on the ground, rolling on the ground and laughing strangely.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and the corner of his mouth twitched.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly jumped up and lit up his sharp golden claws. His eyes flickered with a cold light like the edge of a blade as he pounced at the little girl laughing hysterically above him\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and juice splashed everywhere\!

A black shadow that looked like a vine fell in front of the little girl with a bang.
