Chapter 163: New Territory

The sky turned dark in the evening.

It seemed to only be for a moment.

The sun, which had been hanging on the horizon for a long time just a second ago, fled under the attack of the rain and disappeared.

The bushes were not far from the river.

This forest was much larger than the forest behind the pride of the cold father.

Furthermore, the trees were lush and the bushes were deep. There was everything one could think of.

The rainy season all year round made the vegetation inside lush, like a forest.

The raindrops pattered and hit the huge bushes.

The birds in the forest chirped non-stop.

When Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes with the rain pouring, he was attracted to the tall and lush trees at first glance.

They were a few Baobab trees.

Baobab trees usually grew in places with more dry seasons. Their thick trunks were like water tanks that stored a lot of water.

As for the Baobab trees here, due to the constant rain all year round, their trunks did not seem especially swollen. Instead, they were growing higher, and were almost the highest trees in this forest.

Chu Xiaoye felt a sense of familiarity when he saw them.

At this moment, his heart started to stir.

Perhaps this place could be his first stronghold in building his new kingdom.

However, he did not know if this place was already occupied by a pride.

The frequent rain made the scent of the lion marking its territory disappear very quickly.

Here, every pride seemed to be familiar with each other's territory, and those wandering lions almost did not dare to come to the richest place in this grassland.

Therefore, they were rarely like the lions over there. Every few days, they would go to the borders of the territory to leave their scent.

Chu Xiaoye decided to walk around the bushes after the rain stopped tomorrow.

If it was really ownerless, he would start to plan his territory immediately.

If it was already occupied by a pride, he would see how strong the pride was.

The rain continued for a long time before gradually decreasing.

However, there were no signs of stopping.

Chu Xiaoye stood alone under a lush bush to avoid the rain, thinking about the territory.

Normally, after a lion matured, it would have to wait until it was at least five years old and after its mane grew completely. That would be the best opportunity to fight a lion king for territory.

However, he could not wait that long.

Many wandering lions were slowly tortured to death by the cruel environment while waiting.

Furthermore, in a lion's life, their teenage years were not too long. Becoming a king and owning one's own territory and pride earlier was also a way of being responsible for one's own life. 

Furthermore, he was different from other lions.

He had to have his own territory as soon as possible and then bring Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the others over.

The environment over there was very complicated.

The grassland, which was already difficult to survive in, had humans interfering and many messy creatures. If they lived there, they would be affected sooner or later.

Therefore, he had to open up a home that belonged to him as soon as possible so that the entire pride could survive here.

As for what species were different, noble and low, city people and bumpkins, sorry, he did not understand these.

He would only use his palm to let them understand that no matter how tall and majestic they were, how good their genes were, or how well they were born, they were trash in front of him\!

Pitter-patter.

The rain gradually lessened.

A group of female lions suddenly walked out of the forest.

They shook their fur and came in front of them arrogantly, as if they were noble madams tidying up their expensive fox fur coats.

There were only five female lions.

Obviously, their team was not compatible with the luxurious environment here.

If the territory here was really theirs, then more members of their pride might not have appeared yet.

They were tall, and their fur was beautiful and smooth. They were clean and beautiful, and their eyes were filled with confidence and pride. They formed a sharp contrast to the pride on the other side of the mountain.

Even the Chino brothers, who had already recovered their bodies, could not help but look at them a few more times. Then, they lowered their heads and avoided their gazes, feeling inferior and envious.

They subconsciously felt inferior.

It was like the poor in the slums came to a bustling city and saw the rich who lived luxuriously.

The five female lions looked at them with disdain. They did not have the fear and anxiety that the female lions had when they saw an adult lion.

They stopped in front of the two brothers and stared at them aggressively.

They seemed to be saying, "Country bumpkin\! Get out of our territory\!"

The Chino brothers did not dare to look at them in the eye. They quietly walked behind Chu Xiaoye, seeking confidence and courage.

It was not that they were not brave, but what they encountered after coming to this grassland had given them a heavy blow, making them completely dejected and lose their confidence.

Even the hyenas were so big and united that they were not afraid of them at all.

What use did these two adult lions have?

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and shook the rain off his head. He walked out from under the bushes and looked at the five female lions in front of him.

"Roarâ€”"

A female lion opened her mouth and bared her sharp fangs, looking at him disdainfully and coldly.

Usually, when they encountered fellows who trespassed their territory, they would swarm over, bite the other party to death, or chase the other party out of the territory.

However, it was still raining and the ground was muddy. It was these few foreign bumpkins who had trespassed their territory again. They had no interest in wasting their energy chasing. They only hoped that they knew their limits and could scram.

They never looked at these foreign lions much.

That was because if foreign lions wanted to survive in this land, they had to be slaves and do the lowliest things. Only then could they hope for the lion king to show mercy and give them a little space to survive.

Therefore, they were not even interested in biting these fellows in front of them.

Because they were not worthy\!

Would a high and mighty rich person personally deal with a poor person who had nothing?

Of course not.

Unless he was bored to death.

"Roarâ€”"

Seeing that they were still refusing to leave, the five female lions were furious. They immediately bared their fangs and roared fiercely.

A female lion walked towards Doya, who was at a loss, and flicked her sharp claws.

When she raised her claws and was about to tear off a layer of skin on this little thing's face, she suddenly heard a few furious roars\!

It was the roars of her sisters\!

Furious and terrified\!

She turned around and looked over in shock.

At some point in time, one of her sisters was actually pressed to the ground by the little lion that had yet to grow fur and her throat was bitten\!

The other sisters roared and retreated in panic.

No one could react.
