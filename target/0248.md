Chapter 248: Big Brother Lars

After dark.

The temperature clearly fell.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued traveling.

Now, this forest was lush with vegetation and had plenty of water sources, attracting many herbivores.

In the evening, everyone ate their fill.

After resting during the day and eating in the evening, everyone was full of energy and spirit.

There was a hidden river in the forest.

When he came, Chu Xiaoye walked through the narrowest place. He had no choice but to take the risk.

Now, he brought the team to the narrowest part of the downstream and jumped over easily.

When they reached the foot of the mountain, it was already the afternoon of the second day.

This was the time when the sun was strongest. On the grassland, there were sparse bushes far away.

To Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, this weather was much better than the previous dry season.

However, to the mixed fur lion kings and other members who lived in a suitable climate and had a cool temperature on the grassland on the other side of the mountain, this weather was definitely a terrifying torture.

These lions were tall and strong. They had dense manes on their necks, and some of their manes even extended to their entire bodies.

If they continued to advance under the hot sun, they would probably faint.

Although the Chino brothers had also gone out from this grassland, they had long been used to the temperature over there. Now that they had mutated to become taller and their fur was more vigorous, they were naturally uncomfortable from the heat.

Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry to continue traveling. He found a forest at the foot of the mountain and brought the team to stop and rest.

Not long after he rested, a roar suddenly came from the forest not far away.

Then, a group of strong gorillas ran over aggressively from the forest. They bared their fangs and roared angrily with a murderous aura, as if they had an irreconcilable hatred for them\!

There were about twenty gorillas in this group and they were even larger than ordinary gorillas. However, compared to the lions beside Chu Xiaoye, they were like a group of children.

The leading gorilla was the largest and strongest.

Its roar was extremely loud and it was actually holding a stick in its hand. Just as it ran close, it looked at Chu Xiaoye, looking extremely angry.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it in surprise.

This gorilla was clearly a member of the gorilla tribe he had killed by the river. He did not expect that the other party still remembered his scent and appearance.

Furthermore, this fellow had actually started to use weapons\!

Indeed, the blood-colored rain did not only affect the other side of the mountain.

However, things were different now.

He would not imagine being as miserable and dangerous as that time today.

Before he could speak, the six lions beside him stood up aggressively and looked at this group of clowns with cold and disdain.

The moment they stood up, the group of gorillas that had been aggressive and roaring non-stop a second ago immediately stopped and were silent.

This aura and the natural suppression of species made them instinctively feel fear and tremble.

The roar of the leading gorilla also stopped abruptly and looked blankly at this terrifying group of super lions.

It had never seen such a big lion in its life\!

"Roarâ€”"

The mixed fur lion king suddenly roared angrily, its voice shaking the forest\!

The group of gorillas immediately let out a scream and turned to run. They instantly dispersed like birds and beasts and fled without a trace.

At this moment, the Chino brothers roared angrily and pretended to chase for a distance. Then, they returned proudly with their heads held high.

To be honest, to the current them, this group of gorillas was nothing.

Of course, the prerequisite was that they could not bully others with numbers and had to fight alone.

In a one-on-one battle, their brothers had never been afraid of anyone—other than the king, the king's personal guard, mixed fur and blue eyes, the Jerry brothers, and so on.

After the sun set.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team out of the forest and stepped onto the grassland.

The once withered land was now covered in green.

The grass was lush and green. It grew crazily, as if it was going to release all the energy that had been stored underground during this rainy season.

Stepping on the soft grass and smelling the fragrance of the grass, Chu Xiaoye was in a good mood and wanted to return.

The once dry river had also recovered its vitality and flowed endlessly downstream, bringing life and hope to land on both sides of the river.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and walked quickly along the river.

When he passed by a certain grassland, he suddenly thought of his brother, Lars.

Back then, Lars had formed an alliance with the few lions and occupied this land and the female lions here. He wondered how they were doing now.

He hesitated for a moment and stepped into this territory with the team.

Before long, their invasion was discovered by a lion that was patrolling.

"Roarâ€”"

The lion roared angrily from afar, as if it was warning and threatening, but also looking for help from its pride.

The lion's roar almost spread throughout the entire territory.

Soon, the lion king brought the members of the pride and ran over aggressively. He joined the patrolling lion and roared as he ran towards the invaders.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in place and waited for them quietly.

When they came close, Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that this pride had a total of three lions, but they were all unfamiliar faces.

Lars was not among them.

The four lions that had once formed an alliance with Lars were not among them.

However, behind the three lions, Chu Xiaoye still remembered the female lions from before.

It seemed that in these few months, this pride had changed to a new ruler. No one knew if Lars's five lions had been chased away or killed.

How mighty those five brothers were in the past. They bit the lion and cubs of this pride to death and domineeringly occupied these female lions and this territory.

Unexpectedly, their rule was ended so quickly.

These three lions indeed looked very strong. The mane on their necks was black and shining. Standing with the female lions, they looked extremely male and majestic.

The Lars brothers' defeat looked natural.

After all, among the five brothers, Lars and the fourth were only pseudo-adult. Be it their size or strength, they could not compare to the three strong male lions.

However, now, after these three once extremely ferocious male lions saw Little Ye's team clearly, they immediately abandoned their wives, children, and this territory that they had painstakingly obtained. They turned around and ran, shocked beyond compare\!

Any one of the six lions behind Chu Xiaoye could shatter their heads with a slap.

Not to mention the largest Jerry brothers, even the Chino brothers were twice their size now, and their auras were incomparable.

How could they fight?

In the face of survival and benefits, they naturally chose to live.

As for the lionesses, children, and territory, as long as they lived, they still had hope to have it. And if they died, everything would be over.

When they fled in panic, the abandoned female lions stood in place, trembling in fear and at a loss.

In front of absolute strength, they had long given up resisting.

They wanted to protect the children in the distant bushes, but they were unable to resist these powerful invaders.

Their size and strength were even less worth mentioning in front of this team and they almost had no combat strength.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them quietly, wanting to wait for another lion to appear. Perhaps Lars was still in this pride. Perhaps they had formed an alliance with the three lions.

However, to his disappointment, no more lions appeared.

The nine female lions stood in place in fear, not daring to move. They did not know what these invaders were doing. What did they mean by standing here and staring at them?

Not only were they puzzled, even the lions behind Chu Xiaoye were puzzled.

Could it be that our young king is already mature and is starting to be interested in this group of female lions? Or is he preparing to snatch this group of female lions back and expand the team?

Only Catherine understood what he was doing.

Tilly looked down on him and deliberately walked in front of a female lion. She turned the female lion's butt around and slapped the female lion's butt at Chu Xiaoye. She grinned as if she was mocking him. "Since you want to, come on. If you have the ability, visit these female lions in front of us\! Don't be embarrassed, little lecher\!"

The female lion trembled and did not dare to resist.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked at the distant bushes. He did not see the figure he wanted to see. Then, he did not stay any longer and turned to leave.

The mixed fur lion king and the others were even more puzzled and immediately followed.

Catherine glanced coldly at the little white lion and followed behind him.

Tilly was stunned for a moment and felt her face heat up. She must have misunderstood something. She hurriedly followed and rushed in front. She opened her mouth and drooled, turning into a fool again.

Sometimes, being a fool was a form of happiness.

The female lions froze in place and stared blankly at their backs as they quickly left. They did not stop until they left this territory.

When the three lions that had fled into the distance saw this terrifying team leave, they felt a little unbelievable and immediately ran back excitedly.

The female lions and young cubs still accepted them.

Everyone would fail and be qualified to survive. This was not shameful.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team forward in the night.

When they walked to a riverbank, they suddenly smelled blood.

At the same time, the low growl of a lion came from ahead.

There was a sickly zebra lying by the river.

Three wandering lions were fighting over this corpse.

Two of the wandering lions seemed to be together and were biting another wandering lion ferociously.

The lone wandering lion was the first to discover the zebra corpse. Furthermore, its stomach was already rumbling with hunger and it was so hungry that it could not hunt anymore. Therefore, it did not back down and fought the two alone with all its might.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the team close, the thin wandering lion had already been bitten to the ground by the two wandering lion brothers, but it was still fighting back with all its might.

Chu Xiaoye stared blankly at the thin and weak wandering lion covered in scars. He almost could not recognize him.
