Chapter 303: King vs King

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail brought the pride to his brother's side. He bared his fangs and roared at the golden-haired lion king with a provocative expression.

He had long disliked this golden retriever\!

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur also rushed over with a group of lions.

Then, the cold father also ran over aggressively with the old lion team.

The two teams that had just calmed down during the day turned hostile and murderous again.

However, this time, Chu Xiaoye's team had clearly broken the rules.

Now, they were standing in each other's territory.

Haas looked at Tilly gloomily and recovered his usual noble aura. He looked at Chu Xiaoye politely and expressed his doubts.

"Why did your two subordinates barge into my territory late at night and assassinate me? Could it be that your pride is dissatisfied with our team stationed here?"

"Roar—"

The lions behind him immediately bared their fangs and roared angrily.

Little Curly Tail and the others were not to be outdone and roared even louder.

Chu Xiaoye ignored the golden-haired lion king. After bringing Tilly and Catherine back to his pride, he raised his claws and pointed at this territory, looking at him coldly.

"Sorry, I think you forgot that this territory is not yours. We only gave it to you as a charity to let you stay for the time being. Didn't you respectfully ask for my opinion previously?"

The moment he said this, the gentle expression on Haas' face froze and he looked at him with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye did not blush and continued to express his opinion matter-of-factly.

"Therefore, my subordinates are qualified to enter this place. As for whether they really came to assassinate you, do you have evidence? Why did I rush over and see you bullying them? As a strong lion, as a high and mighty king, you secretly bullied two underage female lions. Don't you feel that you're embarrassing yourself?"

"Roar—"

Tilly immediately roared angrily at the right time, showing her anger and grievance. She even deliberately swayed a few times and fell to the ground, indicating that she had been bullied by this lion king and was seriously injured.

Haas' gaze was dark and the muscles at the corner of his eyes trembled violently. He could no longer maintain his previous geniality and his face became a little ferocious.

"However, don't worry, I will not take offense. Seeing that you are new and do not know the rules, it's understandable. Let's stop here for tonight."

Chu Xiaoye looked at him calmly, his eyes showing the tolerance of a king. Then, he turned around and left slowly with the team.

After crossing the border, he heaved a sigh of relief. He turned around and glared angrily at the little white lion beside him. Just as he was about to raise his claws to slap her, Tilly had already sensed it and immediately jumped away to hide behind Aisha. She even stuck out her tongue at him provocatively.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Catherine.

Catherine lowered her head and did not speak. She took the initiative to approach him so that he could hit her more easily.

Chu Xiaoye did not hit her. He only raised his claws and slapped her head, reminding her.

"Don't save her next time. Just wait for her to die and bring the corpse back."

Tilly gritted her teeth and glared at him fiercely.

Chu Xiaoye looked back, still feeling lingering fear.

If a battle had happened just now, they would definitely have suffered heavy casualties.

Their team did not rush over completely, and the team left behind by the other party was all strong lions with much stronger combat strength than theirs.

Furthermore, from the situation of Tilly and Catherine when he arrived just now, the strength of the lion king could not be underestimated. It was only stronger than him, or else, it would not have been able to make the two female lions look so miserable.

Fortunately, the other party seemed to be a little afraid of them. Or perhaps they had just stationed themselves and had yet to rest. Therefore, they let them leave arrogantly and did not stop them.

However, this hatred must have been formed.

He did not blame Tilly.

Because no matter what, both sides would definitely fight.

Be it because of food or resources, or the wandering lions that had retreated from the grassland, or other reasons, these two super lion prides could not coexist peacefully.

After returning to the bushes.

Tilly was afraid that he would pursue the matter. She immediately jumped up the tree and lay on the branch where he was sleeping. She closed her eyes and started snoring.

She originally wanted to pretend to be asleep, but she really fell asleep.

Since she was young, when she was injured, she would be fine after sleeping even if she was seriously injured.

This time was no exception. 

Catherine returned to the bushes and lay down. Her head was dizzy and she was in a daze. She was not beaten by the lion king, but by Chu Xiaoye.

The night grew darker.

The moon hid in the clouds and the stars disappeared.

The grassland was silent.

Suddenly, Molly, who was patrolling, let out a roar, eager and terrified.

Then, Little Curly Tail roared angrily.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed out of the bushes and rushed over at his fastest speed.

At the border.

Molly lay on the ground, her neck covered in blood. Her body was trembling, and her eyes were wide with fear.

Little Curly Tail roared as he chased after a black shadow. He crossed the border and rushed opposite.

"Roar—"

Suddenly, more than ten tall and mighty lions rushed out of the darkness opposite and pounced at Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail suddenly straightened his tail. Just as he was about to fight, Chu Xiaoye roared and told him to scram back.

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs, his face filled with anger and unwillingness. However, he had no choice but to turn around and run back.

He came in front of Jasmine, his eyes red as he looked at the female cub he always bullied, his face filled with anger and guilt.

Molly's eyes widened and trembled for a moment. Then, she looked at him, seemingly confused by his current expression.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and stuck out his tongue to lick the wound on her neck.

Those were two rows of teeth marks that almost pierced through the female cub's neck. If Little Curly Tail had not roared and rushed over, the female cub's entire neck would have been torn apart.

Catherine and the other members of the pride of the cold father also rushed over one after another.

When they saw this scene, they were shocked and furious. They roared angrily and were extremely furious\!

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head without any expression and seriously licked the wound on her neck.

He had not used his tongue to help anyone in a long time.

Because he did not like to lick the blood of his own kind.

However, tonight would be the exception.

Haas walked over from afar with more than ten lions and stopped at the border three meters away, looking at him in surprise.

"Tsk tsk, esteemed king, are you preparing to eat the corpse of your female cub? That's right, it's all flesh and blood. You can't waste it."

At this moment, this young golden-haired lion king no longer had its previous refined manners and did not look so gloomy. Instead, it had a cheeky and mocking expression.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs and roared angrily at the tall lion beside him.

It was one of Haas's four guards, Merck, who had ambushed Molly.

Haas grinned and looked at Little Curly Tail.

"You can't blame my subordinates. According to my subordinates, it was your female cub, who deliberately provoked my subordinates and pounced on them to bite them first. Unfortunately, her skills are inferior and she almost died. As for the evidence, sorry, can you prove that it was not your female cub who attacked first? You can show evidence."

Haas looked at Chu Xiaoye provocatively and teasingly, as if he had returned a round of humiliation.

Little Curly Tail trembled in anger.

The other members of the pride of the cold father bared their teeth and roared angrily, as if they were preparing to pounce on him and risk their lives.

Chu Xiaoye still lowered his head and licked the wound on Molly's neck. Blood stained his tongue and he swallowed it.

Then, he slowly raised his head and looked at the strong male lion named Merck.

"You did it?"

Merck grinned and looked at him disdainfully and provocatively. He even deliberately bared his fangs.

"Of course. Look at these sharp fangs. They were the ones who pierced your lioness cub's neck\! Unfortunately, I was about to bring her head back and pee."

The other lions beside him grinned and let out mocking growls.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly disappeared from where he was\!

In the night, they could not seem to catch his figure\!

Haas' expression changed and he hurriedly protected Merck.

The other lions immediately stood around Merck and waited solemnly.

"Bang\!"

A figure suddenly appeared in front of Hass. Before he could react, it collided with his head and sent this powerful lion king flying\!

Before the other lions beside him could react, Merck, who was standing in place foolishly, was bitten in the neck and sent flying\!

Everything happened in a flash\!

Not to mention them, even Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were standing beside Chu Xiaoye, did not react.

When they saw the figure clearly, Merck, who had been standing opposite baring his teeth and roaring angrily a second ago, flaunting his might, was already lying beside Molly like a dead dog in the next second\!

The figure that was even faster than a ghost was pressing his head with a claw, making him unable to move. There was still fresh blood at the corner of his mouth, dripping down drop by drop.

The mighty and strong Merck's neck was dripping with blood. He struggled with all his might, but he could not get up.

The suppression of a claw weighed more than 500 kilograms\!

Opposite, outside the border, the young golden-haired lion king jumped up from the ground and looked at the other young lion king in shock.

"Roar…"

The terrified Merck let out a hoarse whimper, as if he was begging for help or begging for mercy. He no longer had his previous arrogance and pride.

"Whoosh—"

Little Curly Tail suddenly walked over, raised his hind legs, and peed on his head.

"Didn't you say that you wanted to pee on heads? I'll fulfill your wish. You don't have to thank me."

Little Curly Tail bared his teeth and peed all over his head, face, and neck wounds.

Merck let out a pitiful whimper, his entire body trembling, terrified and furious. He felt extremely humiliated, but no matter how he struggled, he could not escape the claw that was as heavy as a mountain on his head.

Molly lay beside him and looked at him in a daze. There was no hatred, only confusion.

Was it worth it for her?

"Roar—"

Haas, who was opposite, suddenly let out an angry roar.

This was the first time this golden-haired lion king had lost its composure and become so furious in front of so many members.

"This is the end\! Let him go and we'll let bygones be bygones\!"

He looked angrily and coldly at the younger lion king, indicating that his endurance was limited.

The lions beside him and behind him also bared their fangs and roared angrily, looking like they were prepared to charge over and risk their lives.

Little Curly Tail brought the pride of the cold father and did not show any weakness. He also bared his teeth and roared.

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur, Lars and One-eyed also rushed over with the pride roaring.

The battle was about to start\!

At this moment, all eyes were gathered on Merck and the young lion king's claws.

Molly suddenly let out a whimper and looked gratefully at the young lion king in front of her. She told him to let go of this lion and not let all the lions fall into danger for her.

She knew clearly in her heart that her side was simply no match for this group of enemies.

Time seemed to have suddenly frozen.

The scene fell into a short silence.

Chu Xiaoye slowly raised his claws.

The prides on both sides, whose muscles and nerves were tense, seemed to heave a sigh of relief.

Haas grinned and his eyes revealed a hint of ridicule and the pride of a victor.

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs, his eyes filled with anger and unwillingness. However, he could only turn around and could not bear to see his brother's timidity and retreat.

He knew that he could not be impulsive, or he would harm all his companions.

Merck finally obtained freedom. He shook his head and got up from the ground. Then, he turned his head and looked down at the young lion king in front of him. He opened his mouth and let out a hoarse mocking laugh.

However, he did not mock or provoke the other party again. Instead, he raised his head and walked proudly towards his strong pride, the powerful king.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

He suddenly stopped in place.

Blood sprayed\!

A huge lion's head with a lush mane fell to the ground with a bang.

The headless corpse stood in place in a daze. A few seconds later, its body tilted and it fell to the ground softly.

Blood was still sprayed and his body was still spasming.

The young lion king standing beside him lowered its head and extended its blood-stained claws to wipe his fur a few times. Then, it raised its head and looked at the young lion king opposite it with a sincere expression.

"Sorry, your guard trespassed my territory. We can enter your territory because it's our territory to begin with. As for you, you can't enter my territory because this is my territory to begin with. As for the evidence, sorry, can you prove that he did not trespass my territory himself? If you can, show us the evidence."
