Chapter 119: Lion King's Fury

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail called out and went to Chu Xiaoye's side, rubbing against his body in a fawning manner.

Tonight, he saw for the first time how powerful a trap was and was the first to understand the true gap between him and his brother.

His brother was indeed much smarter than him\!

Mei Mei also leaned over in a fawning manner to lick her brother's butt, wanting to express her admiration.

As expected, she was kicked away by Chu Xiaoye.

Catherine was much more reserved. She stood not far away and watched silently, her eyes filled with drunken obsession.

Such a powerful beast could only flee in front of him.

As for him, he had yet to make a move\!

He was indeed the most perfect lion in Catherine's heart\!

As for Maya right now.

She suddenly remembered the terrifying eyes she saw in the bushes that night when she returned to the pride with the two children.

She recalled the day when this kid suddenly rushed towards her fiercely and then brushed past her.

There was also their battle in the bushes that night.

At this moment, she finally understood.

What he and they had done these few days was actually to protect her and her children.

When she first gave birth, he was the one who brought them to protect her and give her food and water.

Without them, how could she and her children be here now?

Maya raised her head and looked at the figure with a complicated gaze. Her heart was immediately filled with guilt.

Qiqi and Nunu were terrified. They curled up under her legs and shivered.

They were not only her children, but also the children of the pride. How could they have any ill intentions towards these two children?

She was too crazy.

After dawn.

The cold father and the three female lions returned empty-handed.

This was the norm during the dry season.

The pride was already used to it.

However, when they saw that there was still a living prey in the camp, their mood immediately turned terrible.

As for the warthog, it was a little arrogant.

Relying on Little Curly Tail's dominance, it deliberately bit a plant root and crawled beside Maya and the two children, eating with relish. From time to time, it would even grunt at the tired cold father and the three female lions. It was so pleased with itself that it forgot its manners\!

The cold father looked at this bastard's arrogant appearance and was furious. He bared his fangs and roared angrily with a fierce expression\!

At this moment, the lion king's might finally erupted\!

The warthog trembled in fear and immediately picked up the food with its mouth and hid behind Maya.

Maya looked at it with a complicated gaze, then at the hole on the ground, and then at Little Curly Tail beside her. She was instantly in a difficult position.

The cold father looked at her as if he was looking at an alien lion. He had not seen her for a night. Why did this woman betray him so quickly?

Seeing that he did not dare to come over, the warthog continued to grunt as it ate.

Qiqi and Nunu were not afraid of it anymore. They walked to its mouth and curiously fiddled with the root with their claws. They even leaned over to try it, but it was not delicious at all.

What made the cold father and the other lionesses feel disbelief was that the warthog actually did not show any signs of hurting the two young cubs. As for Maya, she did not seem to be afraid at all.

This… What the hell was this?

They had only gone out for a night. What happened in the camp?

Little Curly Tail lay in the grass at the side, feeling bored and wronged.

His brother brought the two female lions to play, but he let him watch this pig. He was so biased.

The despicable lioness snatched his brother's love away\!

He was very angry\!

Hence, he looked at the cold father impolitely.

When the cold father bared his teeth and roared at the warthog, he immediately bared his fangs and glared fiercely at his father, like a little ruffian who did not care about his family\!

It seemed to be saying, "Try touching it? Do you believe that I will slap you to death?"

The cold father immediately trembled in anger.

This unfilial son\! This unfilial son\!

Damn it\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily. He decided that no matter what, he had to teach this brat a lesson today\!

The female lions were watching\!

Most importantly, there was also a pig watching\!

His dignity as a lion king could not be blasphemed\!

Anyone who dared to challenge his dignity as a lion king would pay a heavy price\!

He wanted this unfilial son to beg for mercy\!

He bared his fangs, his mane fluttered, and his eyes spat fire as he charged over aggressively\!

Aisha and the other lionesses were shocked.

Little Curly Tail immediately jumped up from the ground and arched his body, baring his fangs. His gaze was burning with excitement, and he looked like he had long wanted to spar with this old man\!

Now, the opportunity had finally arrived\!

"Roar—"

He also roared angrily and pounced forward. He raised his sharp claws high and, like how his brother fought in the past, grabbed mercilessly at this father's face\!

He looked excited as if he was saying, "Pops, eat this\!"

The lion king was furious. He suddenly raised his upper body and swung his two sharp claws up high, showing no mercy\!

It was as if he was saying, "Unfilial son\! Eat my claws\!"

"Smack\! Smack\!"

In the end, just as the father and son were about to let the other party eat their claws, a figure suddenly rushed out of the bushes at the side. With a whoosh, he rushed to the middle of them and slapped them on the face\!

He was not polite at all\!

The cold father only felt a heavy force suddenly slap his old face. He could not help but tilt his head and fall to the ground.

As for Little Curly Tail, his head tilted from the slap and he turned around before falling to the ground. At that moment, he was seeing stars and feeling dizzy\!

Chu Xiaoye stood in the middle of the father and son pair and looked at them coldly. Then, he turned around and left to continue guiding the two female cubs in peeling the tree bark.

They really made him worry\!

At this time, with the enemy in front of them and their lives unpredictable, they actually still had the mood to fight among themselves\!

How childish\!

The female lions looked at his retreating figure and then at the king, who was lying on the ground with his mouth bleeding. They immediately froze in place and were collectively petrified.

As for the warthog hiding behind Maya, it opened its mouth and widened its eyes.

It was as if he was saying, "This guy is so violent\!"

Little Curly Tail got up from the ground. Although his face was burning, he was not angry at all. Instead, he looked at his father, who was still crawling on the ground in a daze, with schadenfreude and roared a few times.

He seemed to be saying, "Dad, continue to fight. Brother's slap is not a tickle\!"

His mouth was not bleeding. It seemed that his brother had mercy on him.

His brother still loved him\!

The cold father crawled on the ground with blood flowing from the corner of his mouth. He looked absent-minded and was stunned by the slap.

"Roar—"

After a long time, a terrifying roar suddenly sounded from the camp\!

Then, everyone looked at their king in shock. He used his sharp claws and teeth to crazily ravage and destroy a small tree beside him\!

Soon, the small tree broke and lay on the ground dead.

A Lion King's anger was indeed terrifying\!
