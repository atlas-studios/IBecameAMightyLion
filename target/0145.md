Chapter 145: Battle in the Forest\!

Finally.

The python completely stopped breathing.

The leopard still did not dare to let go of it and continued to bite tightly.

As for the huge crocodile, Chu Xiaoye ate until only its tail and head were left.

The leopard was angry and hateful, but there was nothing it could do.

After Chu Xiaoye ate and drank his fill, he did not leave immediately. Instead, he walked in front of it and stared at it carefully. He raised his front palm and waved it before turning to leave.

He seemed to be saying, "I'm leaving, brother. Thank you for your hospitality."

The leopard glared\!

Chu Xiaoye bulged his stomach and walked into the forest, disappearing.

Not long after.

The leopard loosened its teeth and let go of the python in its mouth. It walked towards the crocodile with only its tail and head left. It was so angry that its entire body was trembling.

At this moment.

The bushes beside it suddenly moved.

A small leopard walked out with its tail raised and a few leaves on its head.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

She called out like a spoiled child and quickly walked in front of the remaining corpse of the crocodile, preparing to eat.

In the end, she was stunned and immediately stared angrily at the big leopard in front of her.

Then, another female leopard walked out of the bushes.

The little leopard immediately turned around and ran over, roaring.

It seemed to be saying, "Mom, Mom\! Look\! This fellow is terrible\! He ate the prey until only its tail was left\!"

The female leopard looked at her helplessly, then at the big leopard.

The strong big leopard looked at the mother and daughter pair gently. He could only walk in front of the python and signal for them to eat here.

He was their husband and father.

Usually, male leopards and female leopards would only live together when mating.

After mating, they would return to their respective territories and be alone.

Male leopards would never live in the same territory as their wives and children.

This was not beneficial to their survival.

However, their family of three was gathered together now. Furthermore, the strong male leopard was actually hunting for the female leopard and his daughter. It was a little strange.

"Roar… Roar… Roar…"

Suddenly, the little leopard cried out shrilly in front of the remaining corpse of the giant crocodile.

She seemed to smell something familiar and looked a little excited but also a little afraid. Her eyes were bright as she looked at her father.

She seemed to be saying, "Daddy, it's Big smelly fart\! Is it Big smelly fart?"

The big leopard looked at her in confusion, not understanding her.

Belita hurriedly raised her head and searched the surroundings. Then, she raised her neck and roared at the dark forest, as if she was indignant. "Big fart\! Big baddie\! Come out quickly\! Return the meat to me\!"

However, the forest at night was exceptionally quiet.

She did not get any response.

Belita was very angry\!

That fellow actually did not change his behaviour. He had been tailing her and even snatched the meat her father left her. Damn it\!

The female leopard looked at her for a while, walked in front of the remaining corpse of the crocodile, and started eating.

The big leopard bit off the python's body, bit off the fat and tender abdomen, and placed it in front of her.

Belita was in no mood to eat.

She only wanted to find that smelly fellow and make him scram far away and stop following her\!

She hated his big farts\!

The big leopard looked at her lovingly as he ate. Then, he raised his head and looked at the distant mountain peak.

He came from the other side of the mountain and was about to bring them back to the other side of the mountain.

That was the true heaven\!

Chu Xiaoye ate very much.

He wandered in the forest for a while but did not find any other prey. He could only return to the camp.

The Chino brothers and the female lions could only rely on themselves to hunt and fill their stomachs.

They had to show their value and use to him like the little elephant. Otherwise, he would not let them follow him again.

He would never rear a group of trash that only knew how to beg for food.

The Chino brothers were still okay. They had the dignity and size of lions. If they followed beside him, he could avoid a lot of trouble and help him conquer the world in the future.

As for the female lion and her daughter, he did not see what use they had for the time being.

They seemed to only have the function of being burdens.

"Roar—"

Just as he was about to walk back to the camp, the furious roars of the Chino brothers suddenly came from ahead\!

Their roars seemed to be filled with anger and fear\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly increased his speed and ran back.

When he ran back to the camp, he was shocked to discover that a few huge gorillas were fighting the Chino brothers, letting out terrifying roars\!

The two adult lions were actually scratched until their faces were covered in blood and they did not dare to move forward\!

"Bang\!"

With a muffled sound, a gorilla suddenly jumped down from the tree and its fat and huge palm suddenly slapped Big Chino's head\!

Big Chino tilted his head and fell to the ground\!

On the other side, three gorillas with a few white fur on their heads were roaring and tearing the female lion's body\!

As for the female lion, it was actually dripping with blood and had long died\!

"Bam\!"

Her body was suddenly torn into three pieces by the three white-haired gorillas, and her blood and internal organs splashed all over the ground\!

The three white-haired gorillas immediately started eating.

Chu Xiaoye was furious. With a whoosh, he suddenly rushed over and pounced on a white-haired gorilla, biting its neck\!

The other two white-haired gorillas were shocked\!

However, they were not like other animals that immediately fled in panic. Instead, they roared angrily and pounced ferociously at Chu Xiaoye, preparing to save their companions\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and swung his arms left and right. "Bang bang\!" Two slaps landed heavily on their faces\!

The two white-haired gorillas tilted their heads and fell to the ground.

However, the gorilla that he had just bitten in the throat suddenly jumped up and bit his hind leg\!

Those sharp teeth cut into the muscles on his legs\!

An intense pain suddenly assaulted him\!

Chu Xiaoye slapped it hard in the face, shattering its nose and causing blood to spray out\!

However, its ferocity seemed to have been aroused and it still did not let go\!

At this moment, the two other white-haired gorillas that he had slapped down immediately jumped up from the ground. They bared their fangs and pounced at him ferociously again\!

Not only were these gorillas exceptionally large and strong, but they were also extremely united and brave. Their combat strength and resistance looked extraordinary\!

In their anger, they were not afraid of death and actually gathered together to risk their lives\!

Chu Xiaoye's hind leg had already been bitten by a gorilla. He could not let the other two bite him. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly let out a furious roar as the strange heat in his lower abdomen surged towards his limbs\!

He endured the pain on his hind legs and suddenly raised his upper body. His two hot front palms suddenly looked like two pieces of stiff steel. With a bang, he slapped heavily on the heads of the two fierce gorillas that pounced over\!

"Crack\!"

Two crisp sounds, like the sound of bones breaking\!

The two ferocious white-haired gorillas actually fell to the ground like kites with their strings cut\!

Then, they bled from their seven facial orifices and their bodies twitched as they died\!
