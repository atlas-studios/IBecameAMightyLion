Chapter 46: The Wandering Lion

"Roar\!"

Unexpectedly, just as they walked into the bushes at the back, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately roared in fright and jumped up\!

In the surrounding forest, the corpses of baboons were everywhere\!

Their bodies were swollen and black. Their eyes were wide open and their bodies were curled up. They looked tragic\!

The two little cubs stood in place, trembling.

Was this the baboon that was chasing after his brother just now?

Why were the appearances of these baboons' corpses identical to those of the prey his brother brought back every time?

Could it be that his brother killed these baboons?

Although Chu Xiaoye knew about the situation here long ago, he still felt lingering fear when he saw it again.

Those poisonous bees were so powerful\!

He remembered that even the notorious African Killer Bee definitely did not have this violent poison\!

Could these poisonous bees be some kind of mutated bee species?

He started to be a little worried that the preserved prey could still be eaten.

However, it was useless to think about this now.

No matter what, he had to clean up the ground full of corpses.

Otherwise, it would be too terrifying to see it every day.

He bit the corpse and climbed up the nearby tree, hanging the corpses on the highest branch.

With so many baboon corpses and their strange appearances, he was not afraid that other carnivores would come and eat them.

It did not matter even if they ate it secretly.

The meat of baboons was far inferior to that of herbivores.

Taking advantage of the fact that the dry season was not completely here yet, he would take the time to continue hunting those herbivores.

After hanging the baboon's corpse, he climbed down the tree and went to deal with the second one.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei stood in place for a while before rushing over to help.

Although it was very hot, the two cubs were very active.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye had become even braver and stronger than their mighty father in their hearts\!

Aisha and Xi'er walked over from the front.

The lion and the other lionesses were missing and they were very worried.

And here, the strong smell of baboons filled the air.

They were worried about the safety of their children.

However, when they came to the bushes and saw the terrifying scene in front of them, they were shocked\!

Looking across the land, the baboon corpses were everywhere\!

And their children were actually busy transporting these corpses\!

It turned out that the group of angry baboons had all died here\!

After being busy for nearly an hour, Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to gather the baboon corpses in the nearby forest and hung them on the tree.

The baboons' corpses were hanging from three big trees.

From afar, it looked like a group of baboons hanging on a tree for a meeting. It was a spectacular sight.

The three little fellows were panting from exhaustion as they returned to the shade of the camp to rest.

Aisha and Xi'er looked at Chu Xiaoye. They thought of the scene of him biting the baboon king and being chased by the baboons. They also thought of how they had just seen the ground full of baboon corpses. The gazes of the two female lions were filled with strange bewilderment.

Why was this kid always able to do things that they did not expect?

Chu Xiaoye looked up at them and immediately lowered his head. He closed his eyes and pretended to sleep.

He felt a little guilty.

His actions during this period of time had indeed exceeded the scope of a lion's abilities and even exceeded their imagination.

He had human intelligence.

At the same time, there was also something in his body that could heal wounds, modify his body, and make him stronger.

He did not know what he was now.

However, since the blood of lions flowed in his bones and his body was that of a lion, and even his living environment was that of lions, he was a lion.

However, he was a lion who was different from the rest.

He only wanted to work hard to survive.

If he could help the pride and his current family and companions while he was alive, he would naturally not be stingy.

As for why he almost dragged his mother and Little Curly Tail down because of the injured Xi'er, he was very sorry.

However, if he was given another chance, he would still do so.

After all, he still had the soul and feelings of a human.

There was no way to change it in a short time.

"Roar\!‚Äù  

Just as he was closing his eyes and thinking about how he would live life as a lion in the future, a furious roar suddenly came from the bushes behind\!

It was his father's voice.

His roar was filled with anger and hatred, as well as a ferocious feeling like he was facing an enemy\!

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately got up and rushed under the Baobab tree. With a whoosh, he climbed up.

The lion, the cold father, and the three female lions roared and rushed out of the bushes at the back. They rushed under the Baobab tree and raised their heads, baring their fangs and looking at him angrily.

They had been terrified by the baboons just now, and in their panic, they had accidentally crossed into their neighbors' territory.

Their neighbor, the lion, Bill, immediately brought a group of female lions and surrounded them with a murderous aura\!

If he had not admitted defeat at the crucial moment and hurriedly retreated with the female lions, a life and death battle would have been inevitable\!

A lion hated lions that trespassed their territory the most, especially other male lions\!

They thought that he was going to invade their territory\!

Thinking of the humiliation of lying on the ground and admitting defeat, the cold father was embarrassed and angry. He raised his head and roared angrily at Chu Xiaoye on the tree\!

It seemed to be saying: Kid, come down. See if I don't kill you\!

Aisha and Little Curly Tail were awakened and came to his side anxiously. They wanted to beg for mercy, but they saw him baring his fangs and looking fierce. He did not dare to approach.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and looked down at him. He was neither servile nor overbearing and neither begged for mercy nor provoked him. He waited patiently for him to vent his anger.

The weather was hot, so why flare up?

The lion roared under the tree for a while before finally being unable to tolerate the hot weather. He returned to the shade while panting and lay down.

To a lion, this ghastly weather was especially unbearable.

Although the thick mane on his neck increased his might and dominance, and could even protect his life at a crucial moment by preventing his throat from being bitten easily, it also made him feel like he was wearing a thick sweater. Furthermore, it was a sweater that he could not take off. It was so hot that he felt uncomfortable and even painful.

Therefore, unless absolutely necessary, lions generally did not do vigorous exercise.

Of course, the exception was mating.

Callie was pregnant.

Maya was also about to get pregnant.

It was extremely dangerous to be pregnant at this time.

Ordinary lionesses would not get pregnant before the dry season arrived.

Because food and water were problems.

However, she had no children.

In this pride, only Mei Mei was left.

If the pride wanted to continue living and strengthening, they had to nurture more female lions.

That was because only female cubs could stay in the pride when they grow up and become the main force of the pride.

Every lion would gradually grow old.

A few years later, perhaps the hunting skills of these female lions would slowly deteriorate.

Only by relying on the young female lions could the pride continue to reproduce and survive.

Therefore, Callie and Maya, who had lost their children, now wanted to continue nurturing them.

Although they knew that this was not a suitable time.

However, to survive and to continue the pride, they had to do so.

They only hoped that their king would continue to protect them.

"Roar\!"

At this moment, a low growl suddenly came from the territory of Bill's pride behind the bushes\!

This was the roar of a lion.

However, it was not Bill's roar.

The cold father and the five female lions, who were resting in the shade, suddenly stood up and turned around to look behind.

Although they could not see anything.

A tense atmosphere immediately spread in the pride.

This was the signal of a wandering lion invading.

As for whether he was invading the territory of Bill or theirs, no one knew.
