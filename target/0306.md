Chapter 306: Brother Grew Big

The black fog dispersed.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the dense bushes and fell asleep.

An exhaustion he had never felt before swept over and caught him off guard. When her face was pressed against his, he closed his eyes and fell.

He smelled a strange fragrance and felt heat flowing in his body.

A snow-white and soft body lay beside him. She opened her light blue eyes and looked at him face to face, breathing opposite and looking at him quietly.

The crystal whisker at the corner of her mouth lit up in the darkness, brighter than before.

Her snow-white fur was spotless and flowed with light.

The night quietly passed.

There was silence in the bushes.

When a ray of sunlight shone through the gaps in the leaves and into the dense bushes, the snow-white figure had already disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye slowly opened his eyes, as if he had been reborn, and looked at the world in confusion.

His originally brown eyes flickered with two golden lights, making his eyes appear even brighter, deeper, and more charming.

He was stunned for a moment before climbing down from the ground. He turned his head and looked at the pit behind him.

However, there was nothing inside.

The airflow yesterday was not farts or feces. After it erupted, although there was also strong black smoke, there was no stench.

He remembered that at that time, the little white lion was also here. Furthermore, its body was emitting a strange fragrance that made his entire body go limp and he quickly fell asleep.

Could the little lioness have lit some Ecstasy Fragrance for him?

Chu Xiaoye shook his head, still a little sleepy. He opened his sleepy eyes and crawled out of the bushes.

When he walked to the orchard, a scream suddenly came from the tree above him. Then, a green fruit fell.

Although Chu Xiaoye did not look up, he easily dodged it.

Belia jumped down from the tree with a scream and landed in front of him. She raised her head and widened her eyes, looking at him in disbelief, as if she had seen something extraordinary.

Belita was also lying on the tree, roaring as if she was in disbelief. "God, what the hell\! What the hell\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was feeling puzzled, Belia took a few steps closer and looked up at him.

This beautiful little leopard's eyes were shining. She swayed her tail excitedly and looked extremely excited.

"How mighty\!"

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. He finally realized that something was wrong\!

Yesterday, he had seen this female leopard. He was not much taller than her, but now, this female leopard was almost a head shorter than him. Even when she raised her head, she could only see his chin\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and hurriedly stood beside her. He turned around and looked. Not only was this female leopard much shorter than him, she was also half his size\!

Belia suddenly lowered her body and crawled under him. Her head crawled out from between his front legs and she lay on the ground. She tilted her head and looked at him, her tail slapping his abdomen excitedly.

With this overlap, Chu Xiaoye realized that his body was more than half a meter longer than this female leopard\!

He stood in place, his heart churning and he could not calm down.

Of course, this was not because this female leopard suddenly became small, but because his body suddenly became larger overnight\!

Belia lay under him and twisted her head and butt with all her might, looking like she was fawning like a female dog in heat. Belita, who was on the tree, let out a roar.

"Shameless\! Shameless\!"

Suddenly, a white figure jumped over from a tree not far away and arrived in the blink of an eye. With a bang, it landed beside Belita and lowered its head to look at the shameless lion and female leopard under the tree.

"Disgusting\! Disgusting\!"

She also mimicked Belita's voice and called out.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at the female leopard that seemed to be in heat and immediately woke up. He hurriedly jumped away and raised his head to look at the little white lion on the tree.

Then, his eyes widened.

This little white lion's body had very obviously become larger. Furthermore, its snow-white fur looked even smoother. Under the bright sun, it flickered with a charming luster.

While deliberately mimicking Belita's cry, she also had the feel of a lioness more than before. She looked more beautiful and charming.

Chu Xiaoye was in a daze, feeling that he must have gone crazy.

Now, he actually felt that this female cub and leopard were much more beautiful and charming than human girls. Furthermore, they were more charming and tempting.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"What are you looking at\! Have you never seen such a beautiful lioness cub?"

Tilly seemed to have seen the shock and admiration in his eyes and immediately became pleased.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his gaze and suddenly realized that the female leopard in heat was twisting her butt again and shifting over from the ground, preparing to crawl under him again.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her face and slapped her to the ground, then left quickly.

Belia lay on the ground, but she was not angry or resentful. She was still very excited. She continued to twist her butt and crawl on the ground, letting out cries like a wild cat calling for a mate.

On the tree, Belita covered her face and expressed her shame. She did not want to recognize this sister who was embarrassing herself.

Tilly stood beside her and looked at the distant back with a burning gaze. The tail behind her subconsciously swayed gently.

"Roarâ€”"

When Chu Xiaoye returned to the bushes, Little Curly Tail, who had just returned from patrolling, immediately roared when he saw him. He jumped up, bared his fangs, and prepared to pounce on him and bite him.

After Chu Xiaoye glared at him fiercely, his body trembled and he stood in place in a daze. His mouth was open and his face was blank.

Then, he roared and swung his tail. He ran over excitedly and circled around this familiar and unfamiliar strong body excitedly.

When Mei Mei heard the noise, she ran over. She was stunned for a few seconds before she cried out too. She spun around excitedly with Little Curly Tail and jumped around excitedly.

"Brother has become bigger\! Brother has become bigger\!"

Aisha and the female lions also got up and walked over.

Then, they froze in place, their eyes wide with disbelief.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye realized that the golden mane on his neck seemed to be much lusher.

Previously, it was thin, but now, it was very wide and almost half the mane of an adult lion\!

With his strong body, he looked majestic and was more like a powerful lion king than before\!

Catherine stood behind him silently and looked at his mighty figure, recalling the scene of him being intimate with that snow-white figure last night.

They were indeed compatible.
