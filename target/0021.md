Chapter 21: Migration

Another three days passed.

The female lions still worked hard but returned empty-handed after hunting.

Be it the lion or the young cubs, they were all so hungry that they could not take it.

If this continued, the pride would face an even greater crisis.

On this day.

The lion finally made a decision and migrated to the southern border of the territory.

There was a river at the foot of the hill.

Although the river was not big, the land was fertile and the vegetation was beautiful. Many herbivores must have gathered there.

But.

Beside the water source, other than many herbivores, there were also many carnivores.

If the pride did not have cubs, it would not be a problem to migrate there.

But now, there were still five young cubs in the pride.

The oldest was only a year old.

If they went there, they would be coveted and attacked by those carnivores at any time.

Their pride was just a small pride.

It would be dangerous if they encountered some large carnivores or other prides.

Furthermore, there were probably many wandering lions gathered there.

Hence, for the past few days, the lion had been hesitating about whether to migrate over.

If the cubs were killed, he could have cubs again.

However, if he was defeated, his territory and his wives and concubines would be snatched away. What awaited him would be a life of wandering where he would have a filling meal one day and go hungry the next day.

He might even die.

Although he was still strong, there was no lack of stronger individuals or even alliances among those wandering lions.

If he stayed here, the other party would not be able to see his true strength and would not know the true strength of the pride. Therefore, normal wandering lions would leave guiltily after smelling him and hearing his roar.

Once they reached the borders of the territory, the strength of the pride would be exposed.

At that time, he would probably have to face one challenge after another.

A moment of carelessness would result in wandering or death.

Reality was cruel.

Making a decision was also very difficult.

However, he had to make a decision now.

Migrate immediately\!

If he continued to hesitate, when he ran out of food and became weak with hunger, once an enemy invaded, he would be doomed\!

The sun had just risen.

On the grassland, the vegetation was withered and the air was hot.

The lion, the cold father, brought the five female lions and the five young cubs, and set off towards the southern border with an uneasy mood.

The cubs and lionesses all felt unwilling to leave their home.

The female lions were more worried than the male lion.

They knew the dangers of the water sources at the borders.

There would indeed be abundant and fresh food for the children there, but there was a possibility that they might lose their lives at any time.

The territory of the pride was not big and only fifty square kilometers at most.

If there were no cubs, they would quickly reach their destination.

However, with the cubs as a burden, their speed became very slow.

After walking for a while, they would rest for a while.

The lion could not help but growl and urge them.

Chu Xiaoye followed his mother with ease and looked back at his former home.

He did not feel any longing, and just felt that it was a bit of a shame.

He had planned to hunt in the bushes at the back again tonight.

With his luck the previous two times, he believed that his luck this time would definitely be very good as well.

Perhaps he would encounter that stupid little leopard again. Perhaps he would be able to snatch prey away from her mouth again. Oh, no, he would be able to catch a delicious prey.

He still admired that big female leopard.

The pride did not catch any prey for several days, but the young female leopard could always catch small animals and let her children practise their hunting skills.

Although a leopard's hunting skills were indeed better than a lion's, where did she find the prey?

Perhaps, she had stolen it in the territory of the neighboring pride.

To be honest, Chu Xiaoye loved leopards very much when he was a human.

Their charming figure, their alertness when ambushing, their heroic bearing when running, and their swiftness and courage when pouncing on prey were always fascinating.

Of course, there was also that sexy and charming leopard print coat.

However.

After becoming a lion, this thought changed.

Lions were the most beautiful.

As for leopards, although their fur was smoother and their bodies were more delicate, they were too fancy and were not suitable for lions' aesthetic standards.

"Roar\!"

Gigi, who lagged behind at the back of the pride, could not move anymore. After crying out anxiously, she crawled on the ground to rest.

Her mouth was dry, and she was tired and hungry. She was dizzy from the sun and the hot air and felt weak all over.

Her mother, Maya, walked over and called out to her softly, asking her to hold on a little longer.

The lion's roar could be heard.

The other lionesses looked at the mother and daughter pair and did not stop. They continued forward.

Chu Xiaoye knew that whenever animals migrated, the injured or weak would always fall behind.

At this time, the group would not wait for them.

The fittest survived while the weak were eliminated.

Be it herbivores or carnivores, they were all like this.

Gigi lay on the ground while crying weakly, hoping that her father and friends would wait for her.

Her mother, Maya, also howled at the lions, as though she was begging them to wait for her daughter.

Under the lead of the lion, the pride continued forward.

No one stopped.

At this time, everyone was very tired and hungry. They were filled with anxiety and confusion about their future. They only hoped to arrive at their destination earlier.

No act that drags down a group will get pity or sympathy.

The mother-daughter pair watched sadly as the pride gradually disappeared into the distance.

Maya knew that it would be extremely dangerous for lone female lions and young cubs to encounter other carnivores.

She could only wail at her daughter again and again, hoping that she could pull herself together and continue forward.

Gigi struggled up from the ground and walked very slowly with heavy steps.

In the pride which had already disappeared into the distance.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and even stopped to pee.

Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail also peed with him. Then, they slowed down and lagged behind.

Aisha and Xi'er had no choice but to slow down and wait for them.

Hence, the entire pride slowed down.

Although the lion was very anxious and angry, he had no choice but to stop and rest.

No matter how anxious he was, he could not rush to the destination alone.

Seeing that he had stopped, Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped in his tracks and lay on the ground matter-of-factly. He even closed his eyes to sleep.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also lay down with him without hesitation and closed their eyes to sleep.

Aisha and Xi'er were helpless. They could only lie down beside them protectively.

Lars was already exhausted. Seeing that everyone was lying down, he did not dare to be stubborn. His limbs turned limp and he fell to the ground.

Then, his mother, the lioness with a broken tail, lay down too.

Hence, all the female lions and young cubs lay down.

The lion was extremely angry when it saw this. It growled fiercely a few times, but could only continue to wait helplessly.

Not long after.

Maya brought Gigi along and caught up.

On a nearby slope, a group of beautiful zebras suddenly appeared. They were running and playing or eating grass.

The female lions' eyes immediately lit up.
