Chapter 468: The Saber-Toothed Tiger's Escape

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and the air was cold.

However, the tree in front of him was still safe and sound.

Not a single scratch appeared on the wrinkled tree trunk.

The breeze blew and the leaves rustled.

Chu Xiaoye's claws were still flickering at the tip of his claws, like small sparks that would extinguish at any time. They did not fly out.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at his claws, feeling a little disappointed.

However, he knew that all skills and abilities were progressive and could not be achieved overnight.

Since he even had the legendary claw glint, what was impossible?

"Whoosh\!"

He rushed towards the big tree in front of him, swung his golden claw, and slashed down\!

The golden claw that was flickering with a cold light was like a peerless sword. With a whoosh, it pierced through the hard tree trunk and cut the entire tree at the waist\!

"Crack\!"

Golden light flashed and the tree fell\!

Chu Xiaoye raised his slightly hot claws and swayed them in front of his eyes. The flickering claws immediately extinguished like sparks.

It was still the same golden claw from before. The texture did not change, but the strength inside had undergone a tremendous change.

This was indeed an extraordinary and unbelievable world.

Everything that happened today also broke away from his previous understanding of this world. The world he thought had changed and evolved and mutated seemed to be too simple now.

Obviously, the appearance of the pterosaur and the saber-toothed tiger and the evolution of the golden claws were just the beginning.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly turned around, swung his golden claw, and slashed backward\!

The figure that pounced from behind seemed to be joking and immediately jumped back. Although it narrowly dodged, it was terrified by the aura of the golden claw.

Alisa was afraid.

This fellow's strength seemed to have suddenly become stronger.

Of course, she was also jealous.

"What sharp claws\! They should be good for chopping wood."

Alisa saw that the atmosphere seemed to be wrong and wanted to adjust it.

However, Chu Xiaoye ignored her. He looked straight ahead and left, leaving her with a cold back.

Alisa understood his feelings, but she could not forgive his rudeness and ruthlessness.

They had just been intimate last night but he was already putting on airs today. Were all males like this?

To her, the casualties of the pride were inevitable at any time and anywhere. This was a very normal thing. What was the use of feeling sad and angry?

If he wanted to dominate the grassland and become the true king of the grassland, he should forget all mercy and feelings.

This was not the time to be sad and dejected.

For this pride that had just arrived, the crisis was far from resolved.

"Indeed, he's not suitable to be a leader\!"

Alisa followed behind him, mocking him inwardly.

When the sky turned dark, Mei Mei and Molly finally woke up.

Perhaps because of their physiques or the effect of Chu Xiaoye's saliva, their wounds healed very quickly and the broken bones in their bodies seemed to be slowly recovering.

However, the two young female lions were terrified. After waking up, they could not recover for a long time. They seemed to have had a nightmare about the terrifying scene previously.

Little Curly Tail dragged them into the tree hole above and let them recuperate.

The corpses of the Chino brothers were buried in the pit.

However, the soil in the pit was not filled.

The night was dark and the wind was strong. There was no moon, and Chu Xiaoye was waiting.

The big black bear was still lying on the ground and did not wake up. It looked like the situation was not good. Even its breathing had become weak.

However, the strange thing was that the little girl still did not panic and still said confidently, "King, don't worry. Tibbs will sleep tonight and be alive tomorrow."

Chu Xiaoye was skeptical, but he had no choice.

The big black bear was seriously injured and its face was injured. Half of its head had collapsed. Even his saliva was useless. It could only rely on itself.

The night grew darker.

Chu Xiaoye looked outside. It was time to set off.

He did not disturb any member and left silently.

Before leaving, he did not remind them to be more vigilant tonight. Before he could give orders, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and even Little Curly Tail took the initiative to patrol outside.

What happened today woke them up and made them return to their former nervousness and vigilance.

The pride should have been like this.

Chu Xiaoye took advantage of the dark night and walked out of the bushes. He followed the still clear smell of blood left behind by the saber-toothed tiger and chased after it.

What happened during the day was too sudden. He could not be sure if the other party still had helpers coming to attack, so he did not chase after them immediately. Anyway, the other party was already seriously injured and would definitely stop to heal. He could not run far.

There was a strong smell of blood on the ground.

The saber-toothed tiger lost half of its feet and face, leaving behind a lingering smell.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with a golden light that could penetrate the night as he quickened his steps.

Catherine followed behind him silently like a ghost in the night.

The saber-toothed tiger did not return to its territory. Instead, it endured the pain and passed through its territory to arrive at a swamp filled with the stench of decay.

The bottom of the mud was filled with rotten corpses and white bones surged out with the rolling bubbles. This was a land of corpses.

The owner here was its brother—another stronger and more ferocious saber-toothed tiger.

They were brothers and were all saber-toothed tigers that had mutated over generations. Be it their physique or appearance, they were different from the saber-toothed tigers of the ancient era.

They were smarter, stronger, and more adapted to the current environment.

The injured saber-toothed tiger agilely jumped over a few mud pits and landed in an open space. It lay down under a withered short tree and let out a desolate growl, calling for its brother.

Although they had long separated and each had their own territory, they still had a brotherly relationship. Usually, when they crossed the border to hunt, they would also be intimate and harmonious.

Now that he was seriously injured, he could only come here and beg for his brother's protection.

Although it was a little embarrassing, his life was important.

The strength that the little lion suddenly erupted with frightened him. This was the first time in recent years that he was in such a sorry state and the first time that he was seriously injured.

If he was a step late, his life would be in danger\!

It was afraid and did not even dare to stay in its territory.

Only his powerful brother could give him a sense of security and help him take revenge\!

He continued to growl and called out to his brother anxiously.

His brother liked to kill. Even if he was full, he liked to hunt everywhere. Then, he would bring the prey here and throw them into the mud pit, making the prey roar in fear and slowly sink.

He hoped that this time, his brother could catch the despicable little lion and the other lions and throw them into the swamp. He wanted to see the desperate expressions of those little things before they died\!

However, his brother did not respond.

Only the wind whimpered in the night.

"Roar—"

He let out a third roar and started to feel uneasy.

His roar traveled far, dignified and terrifying. It frightened the distant animals into fleeing in panic, causing the enemies to tremble in fear. However, it also exposed his location.

The cold wind brought with it killing intent.

He lay on the ground, panting heavily, taking the time to recover his strength and spirit.

Although he was injured, his strength still could not be underestimated\!

A miserable scream suddenly came from afar, like the voice of some ferocious beast.

Perhaps, his brother was about to return.
