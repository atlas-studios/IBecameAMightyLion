Chapter 75: The Elephant's Corpse

The sky was still dark.

The cold father's low growl sounded in the camp.

The four female lions got up.

They decided to set off to hunt before the sun came out.

Otherwise, the heat would be unbearable.

At this moment.

Many herbivores that had eaten for a night were most relaxed and easy to approach.

Now that the weather was too hot, they could not bring back their prey. It was also time for the young cubs to learn how to hunt. Hence, the female lions decided to bring them along.

The pride bathed in the bright moonlight and crawled into the dense bushes at the back. They quietly walked towards the distant thorny Acacia Tree forest.

They decided to hunt giraffes again.

Although it was dangerous, only this type of prey was enough to fill the pride.

The murderous aura of the pride seemed to be innate.

As they walked, they were full of life. The birds and squirrels in the bushes fled after smelling the scent.

However, their stomachs were rumbling with hunger, and they were not in the mood to enjoy this prestige.

The pride entered the Acacia Tree Forest and searched for a while, but they did not find a giraffe.

However, there was a group of elephants resting in the forest not far away.

The cold father walked to the front and stared coldly at the group of elephants for a while. Then, he turned around and led the pride in another direction.

They could not afford to provoke such a huge monster.

On this grassland, there were no animals that dared to have designs on elephants.

Even kings of the grassland like them were no exception.

Of course, there were also things that the elephants were afraid of here.

For example, hornets and all sorts of poisonous bees.

Sometimes, to eat the tender leaves on the branches, the elephants would use their great strength to push the big tree over and break the branches.

However, there would be beehives on some trees.

At this time, the poisonous bees would attack in groups and chase every elephant in the elephant pack crazily.

Therefore, the elephant herd was extremely afraid of these little things. As soon as they discovered them, they would let out rumbling sounds and remind their companions to dodge quickly.

Such a huge monster was afraid of these small things. He could not help but marvel at the wonders of nature.

Everything had its weakness.

Almost every species had their nemesis, holding each other back and maintaining the ecological balance of nature.

Those without nemeses, like the former overlord, dinosaurs, would eventually be eliminated by nature.

"Bang\!"

An explosion suddenly sounded in the forest not far away\!

The elephants that were resting immediately fled in fright.

The ground trembled and rumbled\!

A male elephant fell to the ground, and a bloody hole appeared in its head. Fresh blood flowed out.

The walking pride was also frightened. They turned around and ran\!

Although they did not know what was happening, that sound was really terrifying. Even an elephant herd was fleeing in panic, so they naturally did not dare to stay.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up a big tree and hid in the dense foliage.

His heart raced and his breathing almost stopped. He looked at the elephant that was lying in a pool of blood with fear and complicated feelings.

The humans had arrived\!

The sound just now was a gunshot\!

Soon, two human figures walked in front of the fallen elephant.

The male elephant had yet to stop breathing and was still struggling.

A human pulled out a sharp knife, squatted in front of it, and stabbed it in the head.

Blood sprayed, but the two humans were laughing.

The elephant twitched a few times and finally stopped struggling.

The human started to cut his ivory.

Soon.

They left with their spoils of war.

Only the elephant without its tusks was left lying quietly in a pool of blood.

The expression on his face was still quiet and benevolent.

Chu Xiaoye hid on the tree, trembling all over. He did not know if it was because of fear or something else.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail's cry came from under the tree.

He lost his brother and followed the smell back.

A strong smell of blood filled the forest.

The pride returned after leaving.

They did not understand what the sound just now meant. They only knew that prey was injured or dead nearby.

The cold father brought the lionesses and young cubs and ran over quickly.

Mei Mei stopped under the tree and stood with Little Curly Tail. She raised her neck and called out to Chu Xiaoye on the tree.

Aisha's cry also sounded from under the tree.

They smelled the scent of a feast, so they were very excited.

Chu Xiaoye's mind was buzzing. He climbed down from the tree and walked in front of the elephant with them.

The cold father could not wait to eat.

The hungry lionesses also occupied their seats.

Lars pushed Aisha away roughly and occupied the elephant's abdomen with his father.

Little Curly Tail walked behind him and slapped his butt impolitely. He let out a roar and told him to scram with a fierce expression.

Lars turned his head and roared as well. However, after seeing Chu Xiaoye, he immediately put away his fangs, quietly got up, and made way.

Little Curly Tail immediately called out to his brother in a fawning manner and let him eat there.

Chu Xiaoye stayed in place, staring at the bloody hole in the elephant's head in a daze. No one knew what he was thinking.

Little Curly Tail thought that he was not hungry and could only lie there and wolf down the food.

The elephant's corpse was very big, enough for every member of the pride to eat a full meal. There was still plenty left.

However, this unexpected sumptuous meal did not just attract them.

Jackals came after hearing the news.

A group of wild dogs smelled the scent of blood and ran over.

A few wandering hyenas followed.

However, looking at the pride who was chowing down, they did not dare to approach. They could only drool at the side and wait patiently.

However, there were still accidents.

At this moment, the Seno brothers' pride, which he had not seen for a long time, suddenly crossed the border of the territory and ran over\!

The Seno brothers bared their fangs and let out threatening roars. They were brazenly coming to snatch the food\!

Their pride had already been hungry for a long time. At this moment, when they saw this sumptuous meal, they naturally drooled over it.

The cold father immediately stood up, his mouth full of blood, and roared angrily\!

The four female lions also stood up and bared their fangs, roaring angrily.

Although he was afraid of the Seno brothers' pride, the other party was actually invading his territory fearlessly and wanted to snatch his food. He could not tolerate this\!

The two prides roared as they faced each other, not giving in to each other.

The other animals that were coveting the elephant's corpse at the side dispersed and fled further away, but they were still unwilling to leave.

Hunger made them continue to wait patiently.

Out of the six female lions in the Seno brothers' pride, one died and there were still five left.

However, four of the female lions seemed to be pregnant.

The female lions of both sides had equal combat strength.

However, the other party had two lions.

This was definitely a terrifying thing for the pride of the cold father.

However, this time, they could not back down\!

Otherwise, this already small territory would never have room for their pride again\!

A battle was about to start\!
