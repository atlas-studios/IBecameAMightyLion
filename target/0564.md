Chapter 564: Butterfly Love Flower

Take it as sucking up.

Seeing that he could not refuse, Chu Xiaoye prepared to agree.

However, his heart suddenly skipped a beat. He turned to look at Tang Bolang beside him and said, "Brother Tang, have you heard of Mr. Dongpo?"

Although the true Tang Yin was from the Ming dynasty and this was Southern Tang, and the two could not be the same person, he had to be careful lest there was really a Su Dongpo in this world. That would be embarrassing.

"Mr. Dongpo?"

When Tang Bolang heard this, he was stunned for a moment before shaking his head. "I've never heard of this person."

He looked at Young Master Mei beside him and said, "Have you heard of Mr. Dongpo?"

Young Master Mei also shook his head and said, "No. Could this person be a great talent too?"

Young Master Mei turned around and looked at the scholars behind him. "Have you heard of Mr. Dongpo?"

Those scholars shook their heads and said, "No."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly laughed shamelessly and said, "I was just joking with everyone. Actually, I'm Mr. Dongpo. My surname is Chu and my nickname is Dongpo. Everyone calls me Chu Dongpo."

The moment that was said, the scholars hurriedly cupped their hands and said, "So Young Master Chu is Mr. Dongpo. Sorry, sorry."

Tang Bolang patted Chu Xiaoye's shoulder and said with a smile, "I'm Bolang and you're Dongpo. Why don't the two of us form a group and call it wolf up the east slope? What do you think?"

Damn\!

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart and said, "Why don't we call it east slope on the wolf?"

Beside him, Young Master Mei smiled and said, "I've only heard of wolves going up the slope, but I've never heard of slopes going up wolves."

The other talents also laughed and said, "Yes, yes, yes."

Tang Bolang hurriedly waved his hand and said, "Everyone, quieten down\! This fellow almost changed the topic\! Poems\! Make a poem quickly\! Miss Luo Yi is still waiting."

Luo Yi lowered her head slightly with a polite smile, but she was not happy and was very impatient.

She wanted a poem from "Great Scholar Tang", not this unknown kid.

This kid had been changing the topic. Clearly, he could not do anything.

"Young Master Chu, it's okay if you can't do it."

She smiled and whispered, as if she was comforting him.

Chu Xiaoye picked up his wine glass, drank a mouthful, and read out, "When the flowers fade and sparrows fly, the red and the green and water flow around…"

"Good poem\!"

Tang Bohu's eyes immediately lit up and he praised.

The other scholars immediately quietened down and looked at the young man in surprise. The first few words had already displayed the young man's high standards.

"There are few willows on the branches and there are plenty of fish in the sea."

Tang Bohu suddenly stood up and clapped his hands excitedly. "Amazing\! Amazing\!"

Beside him, Young Master Mei also muttered, "There are plenty of fish in the sea… There are plenty of fish in the sea…"

The disdainful Luo Yi was stunned. Her breathing almost stopped as she looked intently at the youth in front of her, waiting for his next sentence.

The scholars held their breaths and did not move, afraid of disturbing this young man.

"The swing is inside the wall and outside the wall is a path. A man walks outside the wall, and the beauty inside the wall is laughing. The laughter gradually dies down without being heard, but the amorousness is angered by mercilessness."

Chu Xiaoye finished reading it in one go.

The cabin was silent.

"Bang\!"

No one knew who broke the wine glass and broke the silence.

Tang Bohu hugged Chu Xiaoye and said excitedly, "Dongpo\! Good poem\! Good poem\! This poem is so wonderful that my heart is surging and my entire body is trembling. I almost peed my pants\!"

"…"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly pushed this crazy person away.

Young Master Mei, who was at the side, no longer dared to underestimate this youth. He cupped his hands and said, "Brother Dongpo is so talented\! Impressive\! Impressive\!"

Chu Xiaoye also cupped his hands and said, "Brother Dongpo is indeed talented\!"

Young Master Mei: "???"

This scholarly meet was already very lively. This made it even more lively.

Luo Yi hurriedly went to get a pen and paper and carefully wrote down the words just now. After memorizing them a few times, she could not wait to play the guzheng and sing.

On the shore of the Qinhuai River, the sound of the guzheng flowed and the song fluttered.

A peerless good poem would appear tonight\!

It was believed that before tomorrow, this good poem would spread throughout the entire city. In less than three days, it would spread throughout the entire Suhang\!

"Brother Dongpo\! Let's not go home until we're drunk tonight\!"

With Young Master Mei leading the way, the other scholars rushed over to propose a toast.

At first, Chu Xiaoye did not refuse anyone and was soon drunk.

However, he woke up.

He had to leave as soon as possible when he could still walk.

The faces and figures of Lanisi and the others had already spread throughout the entire ship. The scholarly talents were discussing in the corner with envious expressions. There were even some who were thick-skinned and came to propose a toast to the girls, but they were all rejected by Chu Xiaoye.

After filling their stomachs, they would think lasciviously and become bolder after drinking.

No one could guarantee that these cultured and talented people did not have any dirty thoughts or ill intentions. When they saw him in the limelight and had a few beautiful girls accompanying him, they were jealous. They might secretly do something or even snatch them away.

Qin Zhitan was a merchant and did not have any status or authority in Suhang. He did not dare to provoke too many big shots and could not protect them much.

They could only rely on themselves.

Therefore, after Chu Xiaoye drank the last cup of Tang Bolang's toast, he immediately let out a roar and vomited at this great talent Tang. He vomited the filth that spewed out onto his face.

"Aiya\! Aiya\!"

The great talent Tang cried out and jumped up, but he fell to the ground drunkenly.

"Brother Tang, sorry. I can't drink anymore. I should go…"

Chu Xiaoye winked at Lanisi and the others and stood up.

Qin Zhitan's family immediately got up and escorted them away.

"Young Master Chu\! Young Master Chu\! Why did you leave so quickly? Didn't we agree not to return until we're drunk?"

"That's right, Young Master Chu, you can't leave\! Continue drinking\!"

A few cultured young men immediately stopped him. They saw that he had drank a lot with the wine bottle, but he was not really drunk. Furthermore, those eyes would occasionally glance at Lanisi and the others behind Chu Xiaoye.

"Drink my \*ss\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and pointed at the noses of these young men. "Who do you think you are? Why are you blocking my path? I'm the Jade Emperor, and you're all my dogs. Hahaha…"

Chu Xiaoye cursed as he narrowed his eyes drunkenly and swayed his body from side to side, looking like he was drunk.

Young Master Mei walked over and said, "Brother Chu looks drunk. Let him go back and rest. We have many chances to meet in the future."

"But…"

The few cultured young men still did not make way.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye kicked them and slapped them a few more times, causing the weak young men to fall to the ground. He still laughed out loud. "I'm the Jade Emperor\! I'm the Jade Emperor\! You're all bastards\!"

Young Master Mei hurriedly said, "Quick, send Young Master Chu back."

Lanisi and Fei'er immediately supported Chu Xiaoye and left quickly under the escort of the Qin family.

After they boarded the small boat, Chu Xiaoye recovered and burped. "Uncle Qin, let's leave today. Do you have a way?"

Qin Zhitan also seemed to have sensed that something was wrong. He frowned and thought for a moment, then said, "Alright, I'll do it tomorrow morning. At most, you can board the ship tomorrow night."

After returning to Qin Manor.

Chu Xiaoye, who was so drunk that he could not resist, was immediately helped into the room by Lanisi. Fei'er was chased out and the door was closed.

Chu Xiaoye was thrown onto the bed. Seeing that the Queen was eagerly peeling his clothes and grinning hideously, he hurriedly shouted, "Fei'er\! Save me\! Save me\!"

When Fei'er heard the sound, she secretly came to the window and used her finger to poke a small hole, sticking her eyes on it.

Before long, Vilis also tiptoed over.

Then, Doya was also tempted and quietly walked over.

Only Denise was still in her room, motionless.

Catherine snuggled at the door and slanted her eyes, looking at them disdainfully.
