Chapter 387: Untitled

The night retreated.

However, the disaster did not leave.

When the sun rose, the sun illuminated the entire grassland. The scene on the grassland was even more terrifying.

Looking across, the entire grassland had already become a sea. There were surging waves everywhere and the corpses of various trees and animals floated on the water. The blue and clear sea water had also become extremely muddy.

The terrified pride stood on a high mountain peak and watched everything in a daze.

In just one night, their entire world changed.

The roaring sea beast did not put away its fangs in front of this majestic mountain. It still bared its fangs and brandished its claws, charging forward fearlessly.

The water level still gradually increased.

The seawater covered the low hill that connected the mountains and rushed towards the primitive forest behind the mountains. It rushed down the trees and bushes, broke down the soft soil, and formed a river that surged forward.

Then, they gathered at the col and spread out. Soon, they formed an oval forest lake.

The sea continued to flow and the lake grew larger and larger, forming many small tributaries that flowed further into the forest like small streams.

Chu Xiaoye did not know if this was a true tsunami.

After the tsunami, the seawater would retreat. However, the current situation did not look optimistic.

Their grassland and home had already been completely destroyed. Even if the sea retreated, what was left was a mess. After this disaster, who dared to return?

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that the members of the pride were already stunned by the scene in front of them.

Even the extremely bold Little Curly Tail widened his eyes and trembled. Even the long tail that always liked to swing behind him curled into circles and shrank to his crotch.

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared loudly, stood up, and prepared to set off.

Although this place was very high and was still a distance away from the sea, under the continuous slap and erosion of the seawater, the soil on the surface of the mountain would soon become loose and cause a mudslide. It was very dangerous.

As for where he should go, he did not know.

In the current situation, he could only find a safe place to wait and see.

If the sea retreated and this grassland recovered its life, it would naturally be for the best. If it did not work, he could only find a new place, open a territory, and build a new home.

Although lions were grassland animals, it was not impossible to survive in the forest.

The world was changing, the environment was changing, and so were they. If they wanted to continue living, they could only change their survival habits in the past and adapt to the new environment and world.

He did not believe that with his intelligence, strength, and the joint efforts of his companions, he would not be able to survive in the forest\!

At this moment, not only was he the king of the pride, but he had also become the spiritual pillar of the pride.

After the life and death escape last night, none of the members of the pride doubted his decision and intelligence.

The entire pride fell into fear, frustration at losing their home, and confusion about the future. Therefore, all eyes looked at him and all hearts leaned towards him.

When Chu Xiaoye decided to give up on this grassland and continue climbing up to find a new territory, all the members followed behind him silently. They did not hesitate at all, like helpless young cubs following a powerful lion king, careful, respectful, and dependent.

When they reached the top of the mountain, the wind was blowing.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked into the distance. The haze in his heart was immediately swept away. He was in high spirits and his blood was surging. Just as he was about to express his ambition for the future, the little girl riding on his back suddenly clamped her legs and grabbed his ears with her two little hands. She said, "Go\!"

The pride following behind him immediately stopped and raised their eyes to look at him and the little girl on his back.

The air seemed to be a little frozen.

The mountain was quiet and one could only hear the cold wind.

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth and bared his fangs. He prepared to throw the little girl on his back down and crush her to death.

At this moment, the little girl was still pulling his ears and looking ahead. Her exquisite little face was filled with determination as she encouraged, "King, don't be afraid\! As long as we work together, everything will be okay\!"

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a moment and ignored her. He walked down the hill.

“I hope so.”

He thought to himself.

Chu Xiaoye was not a lion that remembered grudges, nor was he a petty lion. He would not bicker with the little thing.

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

After taking a few steps, he suddenly swung his tail and slapped the little girl's butt a few times.

The little girl let out a cry and covered her butt. She pouted and looked at him aggrievedly. Then, she pulled his ear and said, "Bad king, don't bully me\!"

With that said, he used his snow-white long socks to tie a bow on Chu Xiaoye's neck.

Chu Xiaoye did not bicker with her because there was a group of tall white wolves waiting for them in the forest ahead.

A few white wolves were rather familiar.

"Roar —"

The cute violent bear and her son, who were following behind, suddenly let out angry roars. They seemed to have recognized the few old faces.

Chu Xiaoye remembered that when he first came to this grassland, he had encountered this group of white wolves under the waterfall in the forest over there. He had even saved the cute bear and her son from the fangs of this group of white wolves.

The cute violent bear and her son did not forget this group of fellows who had almost eaten them, and this group of white wolves did not forget Chu Xiaoye.

Actually, there was no deep hatred between the two sides. It was just a small incident.

Chu Xiaoye had almost forgotten about this.

However, it seemed that the other party did not intend to forget.

Wolves were very vengeful animals.

Although the members of the pride did not recover their full strength, it was still more than enough to deal with this group of white wolves.

Chu Xiaoye still looked like he was on the grassland. He raised his head and strode forward with a majestic aura, not treating himself as an outsider at all but as the owner of this place.

He walked over majestically with the pride.

As for the white wolves, they were still standing there quietly and were not overwhelmed by their aura.

There were not many white wolves, about twenty of them. Although they had mutated and were taller and stronger, they were still not enough in the eyes of Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others.

Wolves were wolves. No matter how fierce and united they were, they were still weak in front of lions.

The mixed fur bared its fangs and let out a low growl. It could not help but rush up and teach this group of blind things a lesson.

Little Curly Tail started wagging his tail again, restless.

At this moment, the little girl riding on Chu Xiaoye's back suddenly pointed excitedly behind the white wolves and shouted, "King, look, there are so many cute little dogs\!"
