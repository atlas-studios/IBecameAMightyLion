Chapter 262: The Battle of the Lion Kings

"Roar—"

The remaining two female lions trembled as they roared, protecting the five young cubs behind them. They looked at the group of black killers in fear and despair.

Last night, their king and their companions had been cruelly killed by these murderers.

They left the territory with the five young cubs and ran all the way. Unexpectedly, they still caught up to them.

In front of these cruel killers, escaping and begging were useless.

"Plop\!"

A young cub was too terrified and retreated continuously, but it accidentally fell into the river at the back. It was caught by the crocodile guarding the water and sank to the bottom of the river.

The two female lions looked back as if they had suddenly made a decision.

They squeezed the young cubs behind them and retreated towards the river.

"Plop\!"

Another young cub fell into the river and became a delicious meal for the crocodiles.

Since they were going to die anyway, the two female lions decided to jump into the water with the children and die.

They would rather die in the crocodile's mouth than die in the hands of this group of demons\!

"Roar—"

The black lions immediately flew into a rage. They roared angrily and pounced forward.

The two female lions immediately turned around with determined gazes. They used their heads to push the remaining three young cubs into the river and jumped down together.

The crocodiles in the river immediately went crazy.

The river water churned and blood flowed everywhere\!

One of the female lions took advantage of the fact that the crocodiles were crazily fighting for her sisters and cubs to quickly swim to the opposite shore. She climbed ashore in fear and left in a hurry.

The black lions stood on the shore with dark gazes, clearly a little flustered.

Seeing this scene, Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Nunu and Qiqi on Pit. He did not hesitate and immediately left with the team.

If he was the only one, perhaps he would have rushed up to save her without hesitation after seeing the scene just now.

But now, there were still two young cubs in the team and the other members of the pride of the cold father. They were all injured and had chased for another night.

If he continued to be stubborn because of his human nature, he would probably implicate the entire pride.

They had to find a place to rest and recover from their injuries before continuing to set off.

Otherwise, once he encountered a situation and was in chaos, no matter how powerful he was, he could not split himself to protect every member.

He had to guarantee that he would bring every member here back safely\!

The morning sun was already a little hot.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and walked along the river.

Little Curly Tail, who was following at the back of the team, suddenly let out an angry roar.

Chu Xiaoye looked back. The black lions did not leave but stayed behind them.

Obviously, these cruel killers did not kill the orphans and widows. The killing intent that had been brewing in their hearts for the night was not vented, so they aimed at them.

The reason why the other party did not attack for so long was naturally because they were very afraid of the six tall and strong lions in their team.

They should wait for reinforcements.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes revealed a cold glint.

Since these fellows had taken the initiative to bully them, if they retreated again, it would only make them take a yard after taking an inch\!

He looked at Catherine and then at Tilly.

These two female lions were very fast and strong. Most importantly, their bodies seemed very small compared to the six male lions with mixed fur. They did not look like they were a threat at all.

If the two of them went over, the other party would definitely not be too vigilant, let alone escape.

This way, they could kill a few first.

The other party's reinforcements should have received the news before rushing over.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye could not let the team stop.

He had to find a forest and hide the two young cubs and Pit on it, so that the female lions that could not fight could hide too. Only then could they fight in peace.

Catherine immediately understood his gaze and turned to walk back.

Tilly seemed a little unwilling, but under everyone's gaze, she could only lower her head and follow.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and brought the team up the hill. He quickened his steps and continued forward.

The unexpected cries of the black lions and the panicked sounds of escaping suddenly came from behind.

Catherine and Tilly had already attacked.

Chu Xiaoye ran with the team.

Finally, two kilometers away, he discovered a forest.

Although the bushes were not big, a few big trees were growing in them. They were all lush, thick, and tall, and were very suitable for hiding.

Chu Xiaoye immediately ran over with the team.

"Roar—"

Behind him, the roar of a lion suddenly came\!

Chu Xiaoye looked back. Catherine and Tilly were following behind and running over. Behind them was a black mass of black lions\!

Among them, a few black lions were especially tall and were actually comparable to the Chino brothers.

Chu Xiaoye only took a rough look and realized that there were at least twenty to thirty of this black lion army, and most of them were strong and majestic lions\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately ran into the bushes with the team.

Without needing his instructions, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei picked up Nunu and Qiqi and quickly climbed up the tree. They placed them on the highest branch and let them lie down.

The two little fellows did not seem to be afraid of heights. Their sharp claws grabbed the branch firmly.

During the period when Chu Xiaoye left the pride of the cold father, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei forced them to learn to climb trees every day and often brought them to sleep on the tree.

Therefore, they were already used to it.

Chu Xiaoye bit his mother's neck and forced her to the tree before she could resist.

Little Curly Tail climbed down from the tree and bit Maya's neck, bringing her up. At the same time, he used his tail to roll the warthog up.

Mei Mei carried her mother and climbed up.

The Belita sisters bit Callie and brought her up.

The wounds on the female lions' bodies had yet to heal completely. After running around for the night, they had no combat strength at all. They could only die down there.

When Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail got down from the tree and walked to the cold father's side, the cold father, who was still limping and had lost a tooth, raised his head and stuck out his chest, looking at them with a dignified expression.

"Boys\! Your father is not a coward\! He's a majestic lion king\! Since they want to fight, how can he be missing?"

"If you want me to tolerate humiliation and survive, go up and hide. Unless the rooster lays eggs, the iron tree blooms, and the female pig goes up the tree\!"

At this moment, the cry of a pit suddenly came from the tree. "Your Majesty, I, the old pig, have already come up first."

"Roar—"

The cold father immediately roared angrily and raised his head to glare at him fiercely\!

"I'm talking about female pigs\!\!\!"

He glared at Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail again.

"Whoever dares to look down on This King today and make This King climb up the tree, This King will fight\!"

At this moment, Catherine and Tilly ran back.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Catherine, grinned at her, and looked at the cold father.

Catherine immediately walked to the cold father's side with a cold gaze. Without a word, she bit his neck and dragged him up the tree.

The cold father lowered his head, his stomach trembling. He did not say a word and suddenly became as obedient as a child.

"Unfilial son\!"

"Roar—"

At this moment, the black mass of lions chased aggressively into the bushes and quickly surrounded Chu Xiaoye and the others.

Nearly thirty black lions gathered in this small forest, forming a huge visual impact. The little animals in the forest and the nearby herbivores fled in panic.

One of the largest black lions walked out of the crowd and looked at the mixed fur and the other six lions. His eyes revealed shock, clearly shocked by the size of these few lions.

However, he was not afraid.

He looked up at the injured person hiding in the tree and suddenly let out a few low roars.

"Whoosh\!"

The eight black female lions standing in the black pride suddenly walked out and agilely jumped onto a few big trees at the side. They quickly climbed up high and looked coldly at the members of the pride of the cold father on the big tree in the middle.

They surrounded the tree in the sky\!

Chu Xiaoye's eyes revealed a cold glint.

It seemed that he had to kill these eight female lions first.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine and Tilly jumped onto the tree and rushed towards the two black female lions on the tree.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also jumped onto the other two trees and roared, challenging the female lions on them.

With their strength and agility on the tree, the eight female lions would never pose a threat to the pride of the cold father.

On the big tree where the cold father's pride was hiding, there was also the Belita sisters.

The female lions in the pride of the cold father were afraid of heights and shivered on the tree, unable to fight. However, the combat strength of these two sisters on the tree could not be underestimated.

As long as those black female lions dared to jump over, they would dare to slap the other party to death\!

Catherine and Tilly were very fast and their attacks were exceptionally swift. They jumped up from below. Before the two black female lions could react, they flew up from beside them and cut open their bodies with their claws, landing steadily on their heads\!

The two black female lions' bodies turned limp and they jumped down from the tree. They fell heavily to the ground and died\!

Then, as if they had wings, Catherine and Tilly jumped towards the other two black female lions.

The members of the pride of the cold father widened their eyes in disbelief when they saw that this little white lion was actually so powerful and was not inferior to Catherine, who was born with divine strength and had golden claws\!

This little white lion's performance previously had always been docile and obedient, looking soft and weak. He did not expect it to be so strong\!

Aisha lowered her head and looked at her eldest son under the tree. She suddenly understood.

They were all golden claws, so that was why…

"Bam\!"

Two more black female lions were knocked down by Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei. They fell heavily to the ground and died on the spot.

"Roar—"

The black lions under the tree were furious and immediately pounced at Chu Xiaoye and his lion subordinates\!

Originally, when he saw that these lions were so tall and strong, he wanted to recruit them. Now, it seemed that there was no need to. He had to kill them all and not leave a single one alive\!

The largest black lion king rushed towards the blue eye.

Because Blue Eyes's aura looked the strongest in this team. The terrifying scar on his face and the lush burgundy mane on his neck indicated that he was different from the others\!

The black lion king thought that this was the leader of this pride\!

Although he was a little smaller than the blue-eyed lion king, he believed that with his strength and skill as a fighter, he could definitely defeat this stupid big fellow\!

"Bang\!"

The black lion king and the blue-eyed lion king's huge claws collided heavily\!

The blue-eyed lion king stood in place without moving.

As for the black king, it landed on the ground. Its feet were numb and it almost fell.

"Roar—"

He immediately roared angrily and called for the few tall subordinates to help.

They were a pride and a team. Naturally, they could not fight alone. Fighting in groups was the hard truth\!

"Kill them\!"
