Chapter 43: Drinking Water

Noon.

When the sun shone the brightest.

The wind blowing from the grassland also seemed to have been barbecued in a fire, bringing with it a hint of heat.

Chu Xiaoye was so thirsty.

Not only was he thirsty, Little Curly Tail, his mother, and Mei Mei were also very thirsty.

He was already walking very slowly.

In the end, because of the water buffaloes, they took a long detour.

The injured Xi'er's body swayed as she walked with difficulty. She felt like she would faint at any moment.

Mei Mei was also hot and tired, looking dispirited.

Little Curly Tail no longer had the mood to run around. He was so hot he was opening his mouth and panting heavily. His steps looked heavy and weak.

In the past, at this time, the pride would never run around the open grassland under the hot sun. Instead, they would hide in the shade of the bushes and rest.

But now, they had no choice but to move their heavy steps and drink water under the hot sun.

At this moment.

Chu Xiaoye finally understood why the cold father was so cold and heartless.

Presumably, at this time, the cold father had already finished drinking water with the three female lions and Lars and returned to the shade to lay down comfortably.

In this cruel animal world, sympathy and pity would kill him and his companions.

In fact, it might even kill the entire tribe.

Therefore, as the leader, he had to be cold, heartless, decisive, and selfish.

Xi'er might have understood that she was the one who had dragged everyone and her daughter down. Therefore, she hung her head dejectedly and moved even slower, seemingly having a mental breakdown.

She seemed to want to give up.

She was acting like she was when she had been seriously injured previously and was preparing to find a secluded place to await her death.

Her body swayed and she lay down, letting out a sorrowful cry.

She seemed to be sighing about her fate but also seemed to be urging Aisha to leave with the children quickly.

Aisha panted heavily as she walked in front of her and rubbed her head. She looked at the three children.

She also decided to leave with the three children.

If every tribe wanted to continue reproducing, they had to think about the lives and deaths of their future generations.

Aisha seemed to be able to tell that Xi'er was seriously injured. She was hot and tired and could not hang in there until they reached the river anymore.

If she did not drink water, she might not even be able to make it through the night.

She had already given up.

However, the children still had to live.

Aisha lowered her head and rubbed her head again as if she was saying goodbye to her sister.

The lion was not here, and she had to make a decision.

Xi'er rubbed her head with Aisha's and looked at her daughter, as if she was entrusting her child to her at her deathbed.

Mei Mei leaned against her side with her mouth open. Her mouth was dry and she was a little dizzy from the heat.

She could not move either.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them, then raised his head to look at the hot sun above him, and then lay on the ground.

Other than being a little thirsty, he was fine.

Even if they went back and forth from here to the river twice, there would definitely be no problem.

However, he lay on the ground and stopped walking.

Seeing that he was not leaving, Little Curly Tail immediately lay down and burrowed his head into the withered grass, as if he wanted to hide from the hot sun.

Aisha stood in front of Xi'er and saw that the three children were lying on the ground and unwilling to leave. She was anxious.

Xi'er was even more anxious.

She had already dragged the children down. Should she still let the children wait for death here under the hot sun with her?

She immediately struggled and stood up. She growled at Mei Mei, then at Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail, as if she was angry. Then, she continued forward while trembling.

She had to pull herself together\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately stood up.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also stood up.

Xi'er looked at them and was stunned for a moment. She immediately led the team and continued forward.

Fortunately, the river was not far away.

After a difficult trek, they finally arrived at the hill and saw the river below.

Aisha heaved a sigh of relief.

At this time, there were not many animals that came to drink water.

The water buffaloes had already left.

There were a few animals scattered by the river. They were all drinking water carefully, and there did not seem to be any danger.

Aisha did not dare to delay any further. She immediately brought them down the hill.

But.

On the way down the hill, a monster suddenly crawled towards them.

Its body was extremely similar to that of a crocodile, but it did not have the armor of a crocodile. It had a forked tongue in its mouth, and its limbs looked thick and strong. Its claws were also extremely sharp\!

It glanced at the pride but did not dodge. Instead, it continued to swing its tail and stuck out its tongue as it swaggered over.

Little Curly Tail thought that the monster was a crocodile and was shocked.

After taking a closer look, he realized that the monster's mouth was smaller and it did not have the crocodile's two rows of sharp teeth\!

He was immediately furious. He roared and prepared to pounce on him to teach this disrespectful fellow a lesson\!

In the end, before he could pounce out, he was slapped back by Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye knew this monster.

This looked like a Komodo Dragon.

However, why was it here?

The African grassland was not where they should appear.

Even his mother, Aisha, might not know this guy. Otherwise, she would not be unmoved.

Although the Komodo Dragons did not have sharp teeth like crocodiles and lions, their saliva and venom were enough to rival any carnivore.

Not only did they eat rotten meat, they often hunted large animals, especially strong water buffaloes.

Their saliva contained extremely terrifying bacteria.

What was even more terrifying was that there was also a poisonous protein that could resist the coagulation of blood in their venom glands\!

If one was bitten by them, the blood in their wounds would be difficult to stop. The venom would follow the blood and quickly enter their body, causing their prey's blood pressure to gradually decrease and their muscles to be numb. Then, they would go into shock and die.

Hence, Chu Xiaoye would never dare to let Little Curly Tail provoke such an animal.

You could bite it many times. It might not die, but as long as you were bitten, you would have to wait for death in pain.

Unless he could be like a leopard with superb ambushing skills and suddenly jump out and bite its spine, causing it to instantly lose all ability to resist.

"Roar\!"

Seeing that the Komodo Dragon was about to climb in front of him, Chu Xiaoye immediately called for the pride to make way.

Although everyone did not understand why this monster was scary, their mouths were dry. They wanted to drink water by the river and there was no need to start a conflict.

Aisha immediately brought Little Curly Tail and Xi'er to the side.

The Komodo Dragon did not look at them. It stuck out its tongue and wagged its tail as it left.

Chu Xiaoye stared at its back and felt a little strange.

Why would such a creature appear in Africa? Or was this actually another giant lizard and not a Komodo Dragon?

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

Just as they walked to the river and were about to drink water, a group of baboons suddenly rushed down from a hill not far away.

Seeing the baboons, Aisha and Xi'er were shocked\!
