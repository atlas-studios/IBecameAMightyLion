Chapter 56: I'll Continue To Endorse For myself

The weather became increasingly hot.

Many animals crawled into the dense bushes to avoid the scorching sun.

Even when eating, they seemed a little listless.

The pride hid in the shade of the bushes and slept through the torturous day.

The lion with a thick mane did not even want to move.

The battle for territory seemed to have calmed down after the compromise of the cold father's pride.

The lions on both sides were uncomfortably hot.

The Seno brothers did not even want to mark the new border. They brought the female lions into the most dense bushes and lay down to rest.

No matter how strong a king was, he seemed so small and weak in front of nature.

At the foot of the hill.

The water level quietly fell again.

In order to occupy more water sources, the migrating hippopotamuses started to attack the crocodiles.

The crocodile nest, which made the herbivores and carnivores on land tremble in fear, could only give up a portion of their territory under the dominance of the hippopotamus.

A hippopotamus strutted into the densely packed crocodile nest and even used its mouth to push the crocodile's head. However, these ferocious underwater killers did not have any reaction.

In the world of nature, everything had a weakness.

Even the strong lion prides, or even the elephant herds that were stronger than prides, had their nemeses.

Dozens of kilometers away.

In the forest, a small elephant fell to the ground, leaving only a mangled corpse.

Its mother stood silently beside it without moving.

She no longer ate or drank. She stood here for three days, protecting the last body of the dead child.

Not far away.

A few carnivores were waiting patiently.

They had already waited for three days.

In the end.

Under extreme hunger, the mother elephant left quietly.

In the forest further away from her, a huge male elephant lay on the ground with its eyes open. It was no longer breathing.

The two ivory teeth in its mouth were gone and its head was full of terrifying bloody holes.

The approaching dry season did not affect the massacre of this world.

However, they still had to work hard to survive.

After dark.

The temperature dropped a little.

The lion, the cold father, left the camp to patrol the territory outside.

That low and hoarse roar could be heard throughout the entire territory in the night.

The nearby wandering lions immediately left.

The neighboring Seno Brothers also rose and fell, letting out more imposing roars to warn and inform the nearby enemies and their own kind. This place had already been occupied by the two of them.

The female lions were resting.

Catherine, who was lying in the bushes, felt her heart start to beat faster.

She raised her head and quietly looked at the figure not far away. Her amber eyes were bright with anticipation and excitement.

But.

As time passed, the night became even darker, but that figure still did not move.

Catherine started to panic.

Could it be that he was not preparing to hunt tonight?

She was very disappointed and even a little sad.

However, she did not give up.

She decided to wait.

However, when the night was about to end, the figure was still lying in the bushes and did not get up.

She finally despaired.

She closed her eyes sadly, endured her hunger and sadness, and fell asleep exhausted.

Not long after.

Chu Xiaoye stood up.

He looked at the sleeping Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, turned around, and crawled into the bushes at the back.

It was better to not let the two little fellows participate in this matter.

After all, it was a little embarrassing.

He walked into the bushes and came to the border of the territory that the Seno brothers had redefined.

The six female lions in the Seno Brothers' pride lay in the bushes not far away to rest.

He could see them clearly.

No one knew if these female lions were guarding against them crossing the borders or if they were deliberately trying to anger them. The place they rested at was very close to the borders.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and stuck out his moist tongue to feel the wind.

Fortunately, the wind direction did not change as it did during the day.

He decided to take action.

The Seno brothers were not around. They must have gone out to patrol the territory.

He could be more impudent.

He really did not want to cause trouble.

However, he was not afraid of causing trouble.

If he got angry, not to mention Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, even he himself would be afraid\!

He raised his claws and covered his nose. Then, he squatted in the bushes at the border.

— Start pooping.

It was as black as ink and extremely smelly\!

Soon, a terrifying stench started to silently drift towards the opposite territory with the night wind.

He shat a little, stood up, took a few steps, and shat at another place. Soon, he shat out a border line that seemed to be cut by ink\!

An invisible smelly army quickly sneaked towards the six female lions who were having sweet dreams\!

Chu Xiaoye started to fart again.

Black fog surged endlessly\!

An even more terrifying black cloud rose from behind him and quickly enveloped the six female lions\!

"Ugh —"

A female lion suddenly vomited in her sleep\!

She came to her senses and looked around in confusion as she vomited.

Then, her face was filled with fear\!

She could not see\!

A large black cloud enveloped her\!

An extremely terrifying stench that she had never smelled or even dared to imagine in her life instantly seeped into her body through her nostrils and her open mouth when she vomited\!

"Ugh —"

She suddenly jumped up and fled\!

As she ran, she vomited. She was dizzy and her limbs felt like jelly. She could not even figure out where she was going\!

As she ran, she felt the black fog become stronger and the stench become even more terrifying\!

She panicked and almost fainted.

Suddenly, she seemed to have stepped on something. It was wet and sticky, as if…

She was dizzy. She raised her claws and placed them under her nose to smell.

Then, her eyes rolled back and she fainted.

The other five female lions also jumped up. As they vomited, they fled in all directions in a panic, like five headless flies that could not see at all.

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

The sounds of vomiting rose and fell endlessly, as if they were singing in a competition. It was a rather rhythmic sound.

Looking at the lioness who had fainted on his feces, Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt a little cruel.

He could not bear to do so.

Hence, he stopped farting and walked in front of the female lion. He used his claws to move a leaf covered in black feces and stuck it in the female lion's mouth.

Then, he left elegantly.

After this, he would go away and hide his identity\!

I am the handsome and cool cub, Chu Xiaoye. I will speak for myself again with my super invincible stench\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

Before he could walk far, two more vomiting sounds suddenly came from a big tree behind him.

He turned around and saw that the leopard and daughter were lying on the tree, vomiting in fear and pain…
