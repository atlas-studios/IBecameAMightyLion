Chapter 429: Untitled

Chu Xiaoye felt that he should be more domineering.

As the king of the pride, this request was not overboard to the female lions, who were members of the pride. It was even a gift.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and stuck out his chest. He took a few more steps forward and looked down at the young lioness in front of him, as if he was giving her alms.

Alisa froze in place and looked at him motionless.

Chu Xiaoye knew clearly what to do next.

To the lion king, there was no need to be wishy-washy and hesitant on this matter. He only needed to walk behind the lionesses and forcefully raise his two front legs to ride them.

He was so direct\!

Chu Xiaoye took a deep breath and passed by this young lioness. He turned around and stood behind her. He had mixed feelings, all sorts of struggles, and all sorts of conflicts, but he did not hesitate for long.

He was going all out\!

This body was a true lion's body to begin with, so it naturally had desires and reactions.

Chu Xiaoye gritted his teeth and did not dare to dawdle. He immediately raised his upper body and rode up. His entire body was trembling. No one knew if he was excited or afraid of the first time that was about to happen.

In the forest not far away, Catherine stood there in a daze, watching this scene without moving.

Chu Xiaoye took a deep breath again and decided to take the last step bravely\!

"Bam\!"

However, at this last moment, Alisa, who he was riding, suddenly raised her tail and slapped him accurately and ruthlessly\!

The familiar sneak attack and the familiar pain\!

"Roar —"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and fell to the ground. He widened his eyes in pain and his face was distorted. He almost fainted\!

At this moment, he finally remembered why this young lioness was so familiar when they first met.

It was her, it was her, it was her\!

It was her\!

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and glared fiercely at this despicable enemy\!

Catherine rushed out of the forest at the first moment and protected him. She bared her sharp fangs at the young lioness, but did not immediately pounce on her.

Until now, she still did not understand the situation.

She did not know why her king chose this lioness cub that had just joined the pride.

Could it be that they knew each other long ago?

Alisa had long turned around, her face filled with embarrassment and anger. Her gaze was cold as she cursed fiercely in her heart.

This bastard\!

She only wanted to snatch his throne, but he actually wanted her to bear his children. Damn it\!

Chu Xiaoye's miserable scream woke the members of the pride up.

Before long, Little Curly Tail ran over with the entire pride, but he did not see the enemy. He only saw Catherine confronting the young lioness with a murderous aura.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground with his legs clamped. He had already stopped crying and looked like he was on the verge of death.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei hurriedly ran close to check on their brother's injuries, but they did not find any wounds. They did not know where he was injured.

Mei Mei saw her brother clamping his hind leg and was about to extend his head to take a look when Chu Xiaoye glared fiercely at her. She immediately retreated obediently, but she was secretly puzzled. Where was her brother injured?

Seeing that everyone had surrounded him, Chu Xiaoye felt even more embarrassed and did not dare to expose where he was injured. He could only growl and tell everyone that he was fine and let them go back to rest.

He could only resolve this matter himself.

He could only rely on himself to take revenge and wash away this hatred and humiliation.

Facing everyone's puzzled gazes, Chu Xiaoye could only clamp his legs and stand up from the ground. He expressed that he was fine again and ordered everyone to go back and rest.

Seeing his unyielding attitude, the members of the pride could only turn around and leave.

Seeing that Catherine was here, Little Curly Tail was no longer worried. He yawned and left with Mei Mei and Molly.

After all the members left, Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground in pain again. He clamped his legs and rolled over one moment and the next.

Fortunately, the initial pain was quickly reducing under the repair of the mysterious heat in his body.

Chu Xiaoye stopped rolling and lay on the ground, looking fiercely at the young lioness.

Alisa knew that he had recognized her, but she was not in a hurry to escape.

She had to get this team\!

She had planned for a long time and endured humiliation for so many days. She did not want her previous efforts to be wasted.

"I was wrong…"

Alisa very consciously lowered her head to apologize.

However, she did not apologize for the tail slap just now, but for the previous tail slap.

However, how could Chu Xiaoye forgive her?

He would never forgive the two extraordinary humiliations\!

If he forgave her, how could he face himself?

Impossible\!

"Was I wrong?"

Chu Xiaoye gritted his teeth and slowly got up from the ground. He clamped his legs tightly and glared at her angrily. "Since you know that you're wrong, you have to accept my punishment obediently\!"

He was not afraid that this lioness would escape.

Because until now, she had no signs of escaping. Instead, she apologized obediently.

Even when the members of the pride rushed over with a murderous aura just now, she did not show any intention of escaping. With her strength, it was not difficult for her to escape.

The reason why she did not choose to escape was clearly because she wanted to stay in the pride very much and had a huge goal\!

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye planned to take advantage of this and take revenge on her\!

This hatred was irreconcilable and this humiliation would never be forgotten\!

Therefore, he had to make the other party suffer an even greater humiliation to vent his anger\!

Chu Xiaoye clamped his legs and walked over step by step. His eyes flickered with the light of revenge. He was secretly thinking about how to torture this female cub and make her life worse than death\!

Catherine walked behind Alisa and blocked her retreat.

At this moment, if Alisa wanted to escape again, it would not be so easy because Catherine's current speed did not seem to be inferior to hers.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye looked like he had almost recovered.

Alisa looked at the young lion king in front of her with a burning gaze, not hiding the surprise on her face. She was indeed surprised that it could recover so quickly and move freely.

This also strengthened her determination to make this fellow submit to her\!

Then, how could she satisfy the other party today?

"I was wrong…"

Alisa lowered her head and apologized again, looking very regretful and sincere.

Chu Xiaoye came in front of her, narrowed his eyes, and circled her body. Then, he stopped at her side and stared at her slender body, baring his fangs fiercely.

"This King can spare your life. You can avoid death, but you can't escape punishment\! You have to pay the price for your rash and shameless actions\!"

Alisa turned around and looked at him, her eyes trembling. "What price?"

Chu Xiaoye paced around her again and slowly stopped behind her. He grinned and sneered. "What do you think?"

A cold light flashed in Alisa's eyes. She resisted the urge to slap him with her tail again. Just as she was about to turn around to face him, a figure suddenly jumped up from the tree and slapped her head\!

At this moment, Alisa was focused on Chu Xiaoye and his wretched face and did not notice the attacker above her.

Therefore, before she could react, her head was slapped and her vision turned black. Her limbs turned limp and she fell to the ground.

She did not lose all consciousness. She struggled and tried her best to stand up, but it was useless.

That slap was too heavy\!

At this moment, she saw that the attacker falling from above was the strong male leopard\!

Blue stood in front of her and narrowed his eyes at her. Then, he looked at Chu Xiaoye and grinned, revealing an even more wretched smile. Then, he turned around and left.

From the beginning to the end, this male leopard did not express anything or explain the reason for doing so.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that he was saying, "King, this lioness cub is already so soft that it can't resist. Do whatever you want."

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. After seeing him leave in big steps, his gaze landed on the young lioness on the ground again.

At this moment, even an idiot knew that it was time to do something.

However, Chu Xiaoye felt that this was really meaningless. He did not feel any pleasure from taking revenge.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to be stuck to that female leopard.

Alisa, who was limp on the ground, bared her fangs and roared ferociously. She looked fierce but was timid on the inside and her body was trembling slightly. She was clearly very afraid and in despair.

She had yet to ascend to the throne and was about to lose his innocence. God, earth, what did I, Alisa, do wrong?

Just as Chu Xiaoye was hesitating, Catherine, who was beside him, suddenly turned around and looked at the distant darkness. She did not move, as if she was saying, "King, I won't look. Do as you please."

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

Alisa roared and shook her head, looking like she was quickly recovering.

The opportunity was right in front of him, and it was fleeting\!

Just now, Chu Xiaoye wanted to tear this lioness cub into pieces and press her to the ground to rub against it, making her life a living hell. Now, he was guilty and confused, not knowing what to do.

Damn it\!

I'm such a coward\!

The lion had lost all its face\!

Chu Xiaoye cursed himself in his heart. He gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and stopped thinking. He rode up.

Success or failure depended on this gamble\!

Whether he was a human or a lion, it would finally be revealed\!

Alisa struggled with all her might. Fear and despair surrounded her, and two humiliating tears actually flowed from her eyes.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. Just as he was hesitating, Alisa suddenly turned around and bit his mouth. Her amber eyes actually turned scarlet again\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly slapped her head heavily.

Alisa's vision turned black and she fainted.
