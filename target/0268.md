Chapter 268: The Birth of the Lion King

It was another evening.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and walked on the grassland. He suddenly encountered a group of water buffaloes.

This herd of more than forty giant water buffaloes was a group of overlords no matter where they went. They did not dare to stop or retreat.

Today, when they saw this super pride, they first stood in place for a few seconds, then immediately turned around and fled in panic.

Chu Xiaoye immediately brought the pride and took the opportunity to charge over.

Seeing this group of giant prey flee in all directions, they no longer had their former arrogance and ferocity. The pride was instinctively excited and brave. They chased after them majestically and unstoppably.

Soon, the group of giant water buffaloes were placed to the ground by the pride and became a delicious meal for the pride.

Now that the water grass was abundant and it was the rainy season, the grassland was filled with a large number of herbivores. All of them were fat and healthy. Therefore, they would not lack food for the time being.

However, as the number of teams increased and concentrated again, food would slowly become a problem.

After all, the pride was concentrated, but the herbivores were still scattered in every corner of the grassland and could not meet the demand.

Chu Xiaoye did not seem to be thinking about these questions.

He only wanted to leave with the pride of the cold father and return to the new grassland to build a new home.

As for the pride behind him, what did it have to do with him?

They could choose to stay or leave, but not everyone could leave easily.

Crossing the mountains was not easy for them, and for the young cubs among them, it might kill them.

The food in the mountain would not be as much as there was on the grassland, let alone a large herd.

If they really wanted to follow him over the mountains, at least half of the members would die on the way.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye hoped that they could stay.

However, if they stayed, who would lead them? Who could make them continue to be united and fight against a common enemy?

Could it be that as soon as he left, this super pride would collapse and scatter? They would look around and be immediately defeated and killed by the black lions one by one?

However, did this have anything to do with him?

He did not know them\!

"Roar\!"

A young female lion came to his side with a piece of beef in her mouth and placed it respectfully in front of him. Then, she lowered her head and left.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. Every member of the pride looked at him with burning gratitude and respect.

When he looked over, they all lowered their heads and displayed the most sincere respect and obedience.

They had already treated him as a king.

"Roar\!"

With a childish cry, the other members lowered their heads and crawled on the ground, calling out to him respectfully.

Under the golden setting sun, the golden fur on his neck was especially dazzling.

At this moment, there was silence.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his gaze and looked forward.

The continuous mountain range ahead was not far.

He had to leave this grassland with the pride of the cold father and enter the forest that led to another grassland.

He could not be swayed.

After dark.

They set off again.

In the darkness, pairs of dark and bloodthirsty eyes lit up.

A group of black lions took advantage of the night and ran over. Then, they immediately turned around and ran away in a hurry.

Every member of the pride was proud and lucky to be able to join this team.

They were even more united and stubborn as they followed the young figure, never missing a step.

No matter where he went, they were willing to follow, even if it was a mountain of blades or a sea of flames\!

The night grew darker.

Chu Xiaoye felt his steps becoming heavier.

The mountain range ahead was getting closer and clearer.

His mood did not become relaxed.

Suddenly, pairs of dark eyes appeared on the grassland in front of him again.

From the numbers, there were hundreds of them and they did not seem to be inferior to the team behind him.

Could it be that the black lions had obtained the news and gathered here to stop them?

Chu Xiaoye's expression was grave. His eyes revealed a cold glint as he continued forward.

There was no retreat here.

The team behind him followed closely behind. They were still imposing and fearless\!

"Roar—"

A lion's roar suddenly sounded in front of him.

More roars sounded one after another\!

When he walked close, Chu Xiaoye realized that the equally huge team in front of him was actually also a pride of grassland lions.

This was another grassland pride that was homeless and gathered together.

Heroes appeared in troubled times.

They were not the only team that could gather lions and make many lions follow them.

Just like in a human war, in the chaos, there would always be a few evenly matched influential figures competing with each other. In the end, the victor would be decided.

The leader of this pride was a super pride with seven lions.

The lion king among them was a tall one-eyed lion with a lush mane.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the team close to them, both sides looked at each other with surprise and vigilance.

Fortunately, neither party was the black devils. They were all members of this grassland.

However, the competition between them would not disappear.

The two super teams faced each other in the night, seemingly at a loss.

If a chaotic battle happened, there would definitely be many casualties.

If they did not fight, who should listen to who? Who was the king and who was the subject?

If they all advanced in the same direction, they would expend a lot of food along the way. Then, who should enjoy it first and who should starve?

Unless they merged together and were distributed fairly by the only king.

Otherwise, no one was willing to submit to the other party and no one was willing to retreat. After all, they had all fled and fought all the way here. They had long condensed into two united forces and formed two unique teams.

At this moment, although these two teams were silent for the time being, they were ready to fight each other to the death and defeat each other at any time\!

It was all for survival.

The one-eyed lion king walked out of the crowd. Its remaining eye revealed a determined and calm sharpness.

He looked at the team in front of him, seemingly wanting to find the leader of this team.

His gaze sized up the six huge lions, but he could not confirm who it was. He could only growl and let the other party come out.

In order to avoid more casualties, he decided to follow the rules of the pride. The battle of the lion king would determine the victor\!

The victor was king, and the loser was his subject.

However, the leader of this team did not step forward for a long time.

This made him a little angry and disdainful.

Could it be that the other party did not dare to fight alone and wanted to let these prides participate in the battle to determine the victor?

"Roar—"

He growled again and looked angrily at the few strong lions that looked most like leaders in this team.

Mixed fur turned his head to show that he was not.

Blue eyes was disdainful.

The Jerry brothers did not back down and looked at him too.

As for the Chino brothers, they raised their heads and stuck out their chests, deliberately mystifying things to show that they could continue guessing.

Chu Xiaoye silently sized up the lion king in front of him and then looked at the team behind him. He felt that this was a chance. The pride following behind finally found a true team.

They belonged to this grassland and should continue to survive here with this team.

At least, his chances of survival would be much greater. He might even chase away those black lions and reclaim his territory.

If they followed him, half of them would die on the way. When they reached the grassland, they would be unable to survive, unable to compete, and all of them would die.

Because on the grassland, even female lions were stronger and stronger than them. They could not compare to them at all.

The herbivores there were also very strong and cunning. If they went there, they might not even be able to catch prey.

That grassland was indeed a paradise for carnivores, but many carnivores could not adapt to it. They would only be eliminated if they went.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye could not bring them over.

When the one-eyed lion king in front of him let out an angry roar again, Chu Xiaoye no longer hesitated. He looked back at mixed fur and the others and immediately left with his team.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment, clearly unwilling to accept this.

Why did his brother waste such a good opportunity?

His brother was the true king of this grassland\!

He had hoped to lead the pride and conquer the world with his brother since he was young, becoming the most dazzling sun on the grassland\!

Now, his dream was close and within reach. Why did his brother give up?

Lars lowered his head and became dejected again.

He turned around and looked at the team behind him reluctantly.

The cold father also became depressed.

However, Chu Xiaoye's steps were so determined that they could not doubt or object.

They could only follow.

However, to their surprise, the team behind them did not stay.

The pride formed by more than three hundred lions, female lions, and young cubs did not hesitate at all and continued to follow closely behind them, not landing a single step.

Lars looked back, his eyes burning and his blood surging.

Even the Chino brothers felt their steps heavy and uneasy at this moment.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stopped.

Little Curly Tail was overjoyed. Just as he thought that his brother was going to change his mind and stay behind to fight for the grassland, his brother suddenly turned around and roared at the pride behind him, letting them stay with a fierce gaze.

The entire pride was silent and looked at him in panic and helplessness.

Many young cubs revealed terrified expressions. Many female lions' eyes were filled with begging. Many male lions slowly lowered their heads, feeling dejected and disappointed.

The one-eyed lion king froze in place and looked at the young figure in shock.

It turned out that he was the true leader of this team\!

However, what did he mean?

Did he want to leave with his pride alone and give this team to him?

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye bared his fangs and roared again. He looked fiercely at the pride behind him, then turned around and left quickly.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment before he immediately followed his brother.

The six lions and the pride of the cold father immediately followed.

The pride behind him hesitated for a moment before following again.

They lowered their heads and had determined gazes. They all followed, not leaving a single one behind.

The few young cubs fell to the ground, but they immediately got up and hurriedly followed.

They raised their heads and looked brightly at the golden fur that fluttered in the night wind, their steps firm.

Lars looked back and for some reason, his eyes were suddenly filled with tears.

Chu Xiaoye stopped again.

He turned around and looked at the silent team behind him. He suddenly rushed over and slapped the two lions at the front away. He let out a fierce and angry roar and told them to scram\!

The two lions fell to the ground, but they got up and crawled on the ground. They lowered their heads and still expressed their submission, their eyes filled with begging.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye bared his golden claws, bared his fangs, and looked at them fiercely.

"Roar\!"

At this moment, two young cubs suddenly ran out of the team and protected the two lions. They lay on the ground and looked at him with watery eyes, begging pitifully.

They were their fathers.

At this moment, two female lions with wounds walked out of the team. They placed the unfinished food in front of him and lowered their heads respectfully and humbly, lying on the ground.

An old wandering lion took the initiative to walk out of the team and into the distant darkness.

More old lions, female lions, and injured lions walked out of the team and walked towards the dark grassland.

They knew that this young lion king disliked them.

They hoped that their departure would make this young lion king not abandon his companions, who had protected them all the way and had finally gathered together.

Their lives were about to end. They really should not follow the team and drag this team down.

Some female lions also left with their cubs.

They would rather leave and walk towards the unknown darkness and death than betray this team or join another team.

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly stopped the leaving lions and female lions.

It was the roar of the cold father.

Looking at the old figures, the cold father seemed to think of his future.

He glared angrily at his son and roared angrily, as if he was reprimanding and reprimanding something.

"You could have saved them\! Why didn't you save them? I don't have a cold-blooded, heartless, and selfish unfilial son like you\!"

Perhaps he knew that this was his genes, but at this moment, he was really angry as he looked at those pitiful figures.

Little Curly Tail looked at him in surprise.

For the first time, he felt that his father was a true man\!

All eyes looked at the young figure.

Including the one-eyed lion king's team.

The night was silent and the wind whimpered.

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a long time before he put away his claws and turned around to look at Catherine, who had been following behind him. His gaze was gentle but questioning.

"What do you think?"

Catherine lowered her head and for the first time, had her own opinion. She did not listen to him anymore. Whatever he said was what he said.

"King, this grassland… is our true home."

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled and he looked at her in surprise. The chaos in his heart suddenly became clear\!

Yes, this was their true home\!

This grassland was their true home\!

No matter how bad it was and how inferior it was to other places, it was still the place that gave birth to them and raised them. It was the place where they started life and grew up.

In order to survive, he could leave and abandon it.

However, now, he originally had the ability to lead his companions, defeat the enemy and protect it. Why did he not care?

Furthermore, the prides from every corner of the grassland had already treated him as a king and hope, as the leader and guardian of their lives.

Could he abandon them and leave alone?

The lions' frustration, the lionesses' begging, the fear of the cubs, and the darkness and blood on the grassland all gathered in his gaze, his chest, and his blood\!

Wasn't his previous dream to let his light shine on every corner of this grassland?

A lion was born to fight\!

If he brought his family and hid in a dark corner forever, ignoring the massacre of his own kind, the destruction of his home, and the trampling of his dignity, would he still continue to turtle when his new home, new companions, and new lion life suffered such darkness again?

Of course not\!

Since he would not, why did he choose to escape this time?

He was a lion\!

He was a majestic lion with fluttering golden fur\!

Of course, he was also a handsome lion\!

He was not a cowardly turtle that was curled up in the mud and struggling at death's door\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar cut through the sky\!

Hot blood surged in his chest\!

He bared his fangs and looked fiercely at the elderly lions and the injured female lions who were preparing to leave with dejected expressions. His sharp gaze erupted with the aura and orders of a king.

"Get back here\!"

The lions that thought they were disliked were stunned for a moment. They immediately lowered their heads and turned to return to the team. Their dejected and dark gazes suddenly lit up again.

All the lions crawled on the ground and raised their heads, looking at this young king excitedly and happily.

The mixed fur and the other six lions had already taken the initiative to move to the side. The pride of the cold father also stood on both sides, like officials attending court, surrounding the king in the middle.

However, Chu Xiaoye still felt that he was too short.

If he was too short, he would not have any aura.

At this moment, he had to show his strongest kingly aura and tell them that he would lead them to kill their way back to the grassland, kill that group of black butchers, take revenge for their dead family, use their blood to mourn for their dead companions, reclaim their territory, reclaim their home, and wash away all the humiliation\!

Therefore, he had to stand high and mighty, brave and shocked\!

He turned around and looked at Catherine.

Catherine's gaze turned cold as she looked at the cold father.

Hence, our young lion king stood on his father's back under the shocked gazes of the pride. He slapped his father's head and started an impassioned speech\!
