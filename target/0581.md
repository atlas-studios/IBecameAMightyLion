Chapter 581: Human Village

The route was a little familiar.

Chu Xiaoye followed for a while before waking up in shock.

He and the pride had once walked this route and it led to the village full of corpses.

They had once encountered the first red-eyed monster there. It suddenly rushed out of the house with scarlet eyes and extraordinary strength.

Almost everyone in the village was dead. The entire village was empty, like a living hell.

Now, the jeep was walking over.

From afar, Chu Xiaoye saw lights coming from the village and a floating bonfire.

When he walked closer, he realized that the village was already full of people.

Even outside the village, many tents were built. Many white-skinned men and women were surrounding a bonfire, sitting on the ground, or singing and dancing. They were having a good time.

Further away, soldiers were holding guns and patrolling the surrounding grassland vigilantly.

The bright distant light crossed and illuminated the distant grassland.

Chu Xiaoye advanced in the darkness like a ghost. Every time the light shone over, he would crawl on the ground, bury his head, and hide his eyes.

Fortunately, after the blood rain here, the grass was exceptionally lush. Many bushes also grew healthily like trees, enough to cover his huge body.

In the consciousness of this group of humans, those red-eyed monsters and the ferocious beasts on the grassland were very rash. If they appeared, they would definitely rush over. Even if they did not roar, they would not be like human agents, hiding and silent.

Furthermore, their security measures were already good enough.

Other than the constant sentries day and night, there were also many huge trap traps and hidden traps in the grass around them. Therefore, they were very at ease staying here.

After checking, the jeep entered the village.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was hiding in the grass to check, the sound of propeller suddenly sounded above him.

A helicopter quickly arrived and landed in the open space outside the village.

The people singing and dancing around the bonfire immediately shouted and ran over, their faces filled with excitement.

These were the resources transported from the nearby city.

After the helicopter finished lowering the goods, it rose into the sky and left.

The people here continued to party.

Even though they were forced into this situation and the entire human race was about to die, they still did not forget their happiness.

No one knew that in the dark and dense vegetation, a pair of cold eyes was staring at them.

After dawn, Chu Xiaoye left.

When the sky turned dark, he sneaked over again and observed every guard outside the village.

During this time, many humans brought back animal corpses and caught some ferocious beasts with shotguns.

The number of animals on the grassland increased.

The red-eyed monsters wreaked havoc and many animals were gathered here, giving these human hunters more joy.

Three days later, the bonfire party was held again outside the village.

It seemed that a group of humans had just fled from the city in front of them. Therefore, they reported the Welcome Gala to comfort their terrified companions.

Chu Xiaoye hid 100 meters away and lay in the bushes, waiting for the opportunity.

At dawn, everyone was drunk, but the party was not over. There were still people laughing, singing, and dancing.

Many unfamiliar men and women were entangled, either returning to the village hut or entering the tent. Some resolved it on the spot, and some went to the grassland at the side.

The few soldiers standing guard were itching to watch. They also took the time to drink a few glasses of wine, invited a few women, and brought them into the nearby bushes.

For a moment, the sounds of sex were everywhere.

A soldier brought a young golden-haired woman and walked in Chu Xiaoye's direction.

The young golden-haired woman seemed to have been forced and looked terrified. Behind her, the soldier was holding a gun at her waist.

At this moment, in this place, all the laws had become blank.

This woman was clearly a married woman. She had just been dancing with a man, but now, she had been abducted by this soldier to the wild to enjoy.

The soldier seemed to be afraid that the other party's husband would discover him. He kept bringing the woman far away before pushing her into the dense grass. Then, he threw away the gun in his hand, impatiently untied his pants, and pounced on her.

"Whoosh\!"

A black shadow suddenly rolled out from the grass at the side. Before the soldier could react, he suddenly punched his temple. With a bang, the soldier's head tilted and he lay on the ground, blood flowing from his mouth and nose. He no longer moved.

The woman widened her eyes in fear. Just as she was about to open her mouth to shout, Chu Xiaoye, who had already become a human, covered her mouth and said in his proficient English, "Shut up\! If you don't want to die\!"

The woman shivered. Her clothes had already been torn open and she looked terrified.

Then, she actually spread her arms and legs and lay down with her eyes closed. She said with a trembling voice, "Don't… Don't kill me. I won't resist…"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and realized that he was not wearing clothes. This woman should have treated him as a person like this soldier.

His gaze changed and he immediately took off the soldier's clothes and wore them on himself.

The woman opened her eyes and looked at him in fear and confusion.

"You'll answer every question I ask. If you hide anything, I'll kill you with one slash\!"

Chu Xiaoye dressed and pulled out the soldier's army knife from his waist. He placed it on the woman's open chest with a fierce expression.

The woman hurriedly nodded.

"Where are the animals they caught back imprisoned these few days?"

Chu Xiaoye asked softly.

The woman was stunned for a moment, not expecting him to ask this question.

She hurriedly shook her head and said with a sobbing tone, "I… I don't know. I just came here today during the day…"

Chu Xiaoye was unlucky to have caught someone who had just arrived today.

Just as he was disappointed, the woman suddenly said, "However, I heard them mention that the animals they caught were all locked in a specially built zoo in the village."

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat and he said, "Then have you heard why they catch animals?"

The woman nodded and said, "I know that. When they catch animals back, they will first feed them well for a while. When those animals are strong, a doctor will give them injections, as if he is injecting some very powerful gene into their bodies. Those animals that have their genes injected will become extremely terrifying and violent. Then, they will be brought to the frontline to act as a suicide team to deal with those monsters."

I see\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. He finally understood why these humans wanted to catch some ferocious beasts.

He hoped that Mei Mei and the cold father were still here.

He prayed secretly and looked coldly at the brightly lit village.

Usually, humans would poach, kill, sell, and eat animals. During unrest, they treated animals as tools to die. No matter when, animals could not escape the misfortune of being exterminated.

Chu Xiaoye took a deep breath and picked up the woman on the ground. He stared at her coldly and said, "Bring me in\! If you dare to play tricks, you'll definitely be the first to die\!"

He wrapped one arm around the woman's waist and stuck his other hand into her clothes. He used the sharp army knife to press against her skin and said, "Go\!"

The woman's face was pale and her lips were trembling. She walked forward slowly.
