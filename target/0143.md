Chapter 143: The Giant Crocodile Killer

Two days later.

They finally arrived at the foot of the mountain.

The vegetation on the mountain was lush and still green. It formed a sharp contrast to the withered grassland.

Even the Chino brothers, who did not eat grass, were extremely excited when they saw the green scene. They were full of hope for their future.

With grass and trees, there would naturally be prey.

The river meandered through the mountains and formed a beautiful river and valley.

The trees on both sides of the river were even greener and taller. Their branches and leaves were lush. Walking in them, it was as if they had arrived at an ancient forest.

Although there was a lot of prey here, it was not easy to hunt.

The dense forest full of trees and complicated terrain provided them with all sorts of protection.

For most carnivores, the wide and flat grassland was the best place to hunt.

Chu Xiaoye knew that his happy life like before, where he walked, ate, and threw all the way, would be gone for the time being.

Forests were not suitable for lions to survive.

Therefore, although the environment here was much better than the grassland, Chu Xiaoye was not interested.

His goal was still the other side of the mountain range.

They followed the river into the forest and continued west.

Seeing so many green trees and grass by the river, the little elephant was extremely excited. It swung its long nose around and ate as it walked.

It had never seen so much food since it was born.

This was simply its heaven\!

However, the lioness cub Doya did not think so.

She had a hard time walking this path. It took more effort than walking on a flat grassland.

Her mother, Dora, did not like this place either.

The surrounding vegetation was lush. Not only was it not beneficial for them to discover their prey, but they were also unable to guard against the enemy's sneak attack.

She needed to be more careful and observe the wind and grass around her.

Furthermore, the sky soon turned dark.

The night in the forest was much more terrifying than that on the grassland.

In this unfamiliar environment, no one knew what terrifying beasts and killers were hiding in the dark and deep surroundings.

They could not continue traveling. They had to find a place to rest and wait for dawn.

They liked to hunt at night, and those invisible killers definitely liked it too.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the little elephant's back and found an empty place in the forest not far from the river.

He looked up at the tall tree.

He was already used to sleeping on trees, and in this forest, the tree was the safest.

But now, he could only look at the tree and sigh.

When could his claws grow out?

He believed that he would grow claws again, but he did not know when.

Could it be that he had to wait for his testosterone to secrete and sexual maturity?

That was too slow.

As he had been riding the elephant during the day, he was still full of energy.

However, his stomach was starting to feel hungry.

He had to find something to eat.

As for the two wandering lions and the female lion and her daughter, he could not care less.

He was the future high and mighty king, not those pitiful female lions that had to work hard to hunt and stay in the pride\!

He would not ask for trouble and take care of them\!

The little elephant ate the leaves and fruits around it happily.

The Chino brothers were exhausted and lay down in the grass to rest.

The female lion and her daughter were also exhausted. Soon, they lay in the grass and fell asleep.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left, walking into the dark forest.

It was much cooler here, but there was a terrifying feeling.

The huge forest was silent.

His soft feet stepped on the soft grass and did not make any sound.

His dark eyes could see very clearly in the night.

However, there was no prey here.

Chu Xiaoye searched for a while and could only walk towards the river.

Some herbivores would take advantage of the night to drink water by the river.

He stopped under a big tree by the river and waited patiently through the dense bushes.

Before long, a dark head suddenly popped out of the calm river.

When he looked carefully, it was a crocodile\!

The crocodile quickly swam towards the shore. When it climbed up the shore, Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that this crocodile was four to five meters long and terrifyingly huge\!

Its entire body was black and covered in stiff armor. The tail that was dragging behind it was thick and long. When it swung, it was strong and intimidating\!

In its slightly open mouth, two rows of fangs were sharp and cold. They were sharp and long, and they were more dense and thick than ordinary crocodiles.

Chu Xiaoye had no doubt that if it bit his neck, his entire neck would be broken\!

This was definitely not the ordinary crocodiles he had seen in the past\!

This fellow looked to be at least 500 kilograms and was much larger and stronger than an adult lion. His combat strength naturally could not be underestimated\!

Of course, the other party was definitely not as agile as him.

However, he did not dare to provoke this thing casually. If he was accidentally bitten by it, his small body would definitely be split into two.

However, what was it going to do when it came ashore at night?

The prey on the shore was not easy to catch with its size and crawling speed.

It stopped in the grass not far from the river.

Then, it lay there and stopped moving.

It turned out that its eggs were buried there and it was hatching them.

A thought flashed across Chu Xiaoye's mind. Should he wait for it to leave and try stealing an egg?

Monkeys stealing peaches and lions stealing eggs were all for survival. It was understandable.

However, it was obvious that the crocodile had no intention of leaving for the time being.

Since it was here, there should be no prey here.

Chu Xiaoye sighed. Just as he was about to leave, a figure suddenly jumped out from the grass behind the crocodile and pounced on the back of the crocodile\!

The huge crocodile hurriedly opened its mouth and turned its head, wanting to retaliate\!

However, the figure bit its neck and instantly immobilized it\!

Chu Xiaoye looked over and his heart skipped a beat. It was a leopard\!

The leopard was not too big and was almost twice as small as the crocodile. However, its teeth accurately bit the crocodile's vital spot, causing it to immediately lose the ability to resist\!

Its pounce just now was as fast as lightning, preventing the crocodile from reacting in time\!

The difference in size and strength actually became useless at this moment\!

Cat eating fish was indeed an eternal truth\!

The crocodile was very big and had a lot of meat. Chu Xiaoye felt that this leopard would definitely not be able to finish it. He decided to be thick-skinned and take a share.

This scene seemed familiar.

The leopard's back looked so familiar.
