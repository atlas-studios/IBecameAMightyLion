Chapter 54: Catherine's Anticipation

"Roar—"

When Callie and Maya ran to the prey and were about to enjoy the food, Lars suddenly bared his fangs and let out a threatening roar.

His mouth was full of blood. His head and butt were badly mutilated and he looked ferocious.

The two pregnant lionesses were shocked.

When the lioness with a broken tail saw this, she immediately walked to Lars' side, wanting to teach this arrogant and despotic son a lesson.

However, just as she raised her claw, Lars suddenly turned around and opened his mouth to bite her. His appearance was extremely fierce, and there was even a trace of flesh between his teeth\!

The lioness with a broken tail hurriedly retreated and looked at him in fear and unfamiliarity.

"Roar—"

Lars roared at her with a dark and terrifying gaze. Seeing that she did not dare to go forward again, he immediately continued to eat his prey greedily.

This overbearing, arrogant, heartless, and greedy appearance immediately angered all the female lions.

They looked at each other and seemed to see the anger in each other's eyes.

However, they still endured it.

Because they knew that that moment was not far away.

The cold father's attitude was becoming more and more clear.

As for this stupid brat, he seemed to know nothing. He actually continued to push his luck and become even more greedy and impudent.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to the prey and stood beside Lars.

Lars bared his fangs and turned his head, preparing to roar. Seeing that it was them, he immediately retracted his fangs and continued to lower his head to eat. His body even took the initiative to move to the side.

He could not afford to provoke these three for the time being.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and called out to Callie and Maya to let them come and eat.

Little Curly Tail was close to Lars and deliberately squeezed towards him. After a while, he squeezed him behind the butt of the prey.

Lars dared to be angry but did not dare to say anything. He could only eat the meat on the butt of his prey.

Chu Xiaoye called out and brought Little Curly Tail to the other side, giving the best seat to the pregnant Callie and Maya.

The two female lions looked at the two brothers gratefully and immediately went in front of the prey to eat.

Lars looked angrily at Little Curly Tail, feeling fear and humiliation.

This kid was ruthless. He would bite his neck and slit his throat at every turn. He could only tolerate it for the time being.

At that time, when a thick mane grew on his neck and he became as mighty and strong as his father, it would not be too late to take revenge\!

Most of the gnu was quickly shared and polished off.

Lars was not full.

He licked the blood at the corner of his mouth and looked at Callie and Maya with a dark gaze, feeling very dissatisfied.

These two female lions ate the most every time. Damn it\!

He was a lion, and he should be enjoying the most food\!

One day, he would become their king, just like their father. One roar would make them tremble in fear\!

At this moment, Lars's heart was filled with resentment for not being full, the humiliation and anger of being bullied by the Little Curly Tail brothers, and being scratched by Mei Mei\!

He looked coldly at the lioness cub outside under the bushes.

He decided to vent his anger on her\!

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and ran over with a fierce expression\!

This foreign lioness cub had no backing. No one would care about her. Even if he bit her to death, it did not matter\!

Lars decided to vent all his anger on this lone lioness cub\!

He wanted to restore his prestige and confidence as a lion\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Who knew that just as he rushed in front of the female cub, before he could bite her, the female cub suddenly jumped up and swung its sharp claws, quickly and peerlessly scratching his face a few times\!

Then, with a whoosh, she jumped out and jumped onto another Baobab tree. She climbed up extremely agilely\!

This scene not only stunned Lars\!

Even the lionesses and Little Curly Tail were stunned\!

This female cub also knew how to climb trees?

Furthermore, she could climb so well?

"Roar—"

It was only at this moment that Lars's scream rang out miserably\!

He swung his head and rolled on the ground in pain. His roar was filled with pain and despair\!

Now, even this foreign female lion dared to bully him. He, this lion, was too cowardly to live\!

The female lions stood not far away and looked at him coldly.

Even his mother, the lioness with a broken tail, stood silently in place with no reaction.

Catherine stood valiantly on the Baobab tree and looked at him coldly with determination on her face.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and thought it was funny. This lioness cub learned quite quickly. Her claws were even more vicious than Mei Mei's.

Little Curly Tail gloated as he ran beside Lars, roaring as if he was mimicking his scream.

Lars got up from the ground, his face covered in blood, and glared at him.

Little Curly Tail did not back down at all. His gaze was disdainful and he even bared his fangs and let out a roar of provocation and challenge.

Lars pretended not to hear and immediately turned around and returned to the bushes. He lay down with a dejected and embarrassed expression.

Little Curly Tail found it boring and ignored him. He turned around and walked under the Baobab tree. He looked up at Catherine and continued to roar in challenge.

He felt that this lioness cub was quite fast and fierce. He could use her to practice.

As for Mei Mei, it was better not to play with her. It was really boring to tell on her to her brother.

"Roar—"

He continued to roar at the lioness on the tree, looking eager.

Catherine looked down at him and ignored him.

Little Curly Tail felt that he had been underestimated. He immediately took a few steps back and prepared to sprint up and teach her a lesson.

Mei Mei immediately ran over and blocked his way, telling him not to bully her.

Little Curly Tail looked at her, then turned around and looked at his brother.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the grass with his eyes closed and was sleeping.

He still had to practice hunting at night.

Little Curly Tail did not know if Mei Mei wanted to do this on her own or whether it was his brother's idea. He hesitated for a moment and could only give up.

It was better to be careful and not provoke this lioness cub.

If this guy went to his brother's place to complain again and disturbed his sleep, his brother would definitely vent his anger on him again.

His brother's super invincible fart was no joke\!

Every time he thought of it, his stomach would churn.

How terrifying\!

He still had to follow her brother to learn hunting skills at night. It was better to sleep.

At the thought of this, Little Curly Tail walked into the bushes and lay down to sleep.

Mei Mei looked up at Catherine on the tree and lay down in the shade of the bushes.

He still had something to do at night.

Catherine stood on the tree and stared blankly at the figure for a while. She was feeling terrible from the sun. She also climbed down the tree and walked to the bushes further away. She carefully lay down.

To prevent Lars from ambushing her, she slept very lightly.

She was a little hungry.

However, it was okay.

She looked forward to the night, looked forward to secretly following behind him, and looked at his brave, strong, confident, and confident figure.

She believed that every night was wonderful.

As long as he was here.
