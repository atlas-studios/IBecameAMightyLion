Chapter 148: The Strange Forest

How should he come over?

The little elephant raised its nose and let out an anxious moo. It paced around the river anxiously.

She could not live without Chu Xiaoye's farts\!

The brothers stood beside the river, bared their fangs, and roared at the giant crocodiles in the river, seemingly wanting to scare them away.

However, the huge crocodile raised its head and opened its mouth to respond with its sharp teeth.

They seemed to be provoking each other.

"What are you looking at?"

"So what if I'm looking at you?"

"Take a look again?"

"Just try?"

Hence, the two sides continued to be in a deadlock.

Doya lay on the little elephant's back and looked at the crocodiles and the ferocious fish in the river in fear. Then, she looked at the young male cub.

He could have ridden over on the back of the elephant, but he let her have the seat.

What should he do now?

The blood in the river attracted more crocodiles.

The crocodile heads moved all over the river, forming a black mass.

Some crocodiles were taking the opportunity to eat the fish, and some crocodiles dragged the corpses of the gorillas on the shallow water down, fighting crazily for them.

Some crocodiles were waiting.

This river was almost cut off by the exaggerated size of the crocodiles.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left by the river. He picked up the remaining gorilla corpses and threw them into the river.

"Whoosh\!"

Immediately, water splashed everywhere and the river was in chaos\!

The crocodiles immediately surged towards the corpses and started biting them. They did not care if it was crowded as they rolled and devoured the corpses\!

Their attention was completely focused on the corpses of the gorillas\!

"Whooshâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to step on the gorillas' corpses and jump up from the river\!

He did not jump too high, nor did he think of jumping over immediately. Because in that case, once he fell into the shallow shore on the other side and fell into the sand, as long as he reacted slower, he would be bitten by the crocodiles that were crowding around there\!

"Bam\!"

He landed in the middle of the river and happened to land on the head of a crocodile\!

The crocodile was fighting for food. It did not expect a cub to fall from the sky\!

When it was shocked and was about to raise its head to bite, Chu Xiaoye had already jumped out again and jumped on the back of another crocodile in front of it\!

The two crocodiles on the opposite shore finally discovered him. They immediately opened their mouths and raised their heads, preparing to bite him\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly used all his strength and jumped up high with a whoosh. He flew over three to four meters above their heads and landed on the small elephant's back, standing steadily\!

The little elephant was caught off guard. Its body trembled and it almost knelt down\!

Doya, who was lying on the little elephant's back, widened her eyes and stared blankly at the young and brave lion in front of her, as if she was scared silly.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her, turned around, and aimed his butt at her, urging the little elephant to set off.

The brothers were extremely excited. They immediately ran over and followed behind the little elephant on the left and right.

As expected of their boss. That elegant and heroic bearing when crossing the river blinded their eyes\!

The little elephant walked very slowly and seemed to be limping a little.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and realized that there were signs of being bitten on its four thick legs. It was still bleeding.

It seemed that when they crossed the river, there were still a few fish attacking it at the bottom of the river.

Because of it, the Chino brothers were safe and sound.

Then, they should rest for a while.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the little elephant's back and gestured for them to rest.

He bit a leaf on the ground and held it in his mouth for a while, then walked to the small elephant's thigh and rubbed its wound gently with the saliva on the leaf.

The little elephant did not appreciate it. It raised its nose and rubbed his butt, letting him continue to fart.

Its smoking addiction came again.

It did not like saliva and only liked to eat farts\!

Chu Xiaoye slapped its nose and swung it forward. "Bam\!" It happened to land on Big Chino and actually slapped this lion to the ground\!

Big Chino grimaced in pain, but did not dare to make a sound. He hurriedly got up and retreated into the distance.

Chu Xiaoye raised his foot to look. He was indeed much stronger, but his claws still did not show any signs of growing.

Without claws, he could not climb trees. Be it fighting or hunting, he lacked a powerful skill. He was a little anxious.

Seeing that he was being rough, the little elephant was very angry, but it did not dare to retaliate, afraid that this fellow would never fart for it again.

After resting for half a day.

In the afternoon, they continued forward.

Under the cover of the trees, the sun here was not as hot as it was on the grassland.

The air in the forest was also much humid.

Walking in it was rather comfortable.

The trees that were struck by the lightning fell to the ground, covered in green vines and moss. A few colorful butterflies stopped on them and drank the juice.

The birds cried in the surrounding forest, attracting the opposite sex. The squirrels hid on the tree and peeked at this strange group.

The environment here was beautiful, but it was not suitable for them.

Chu Xiaoye brought them and continued to overcome the obstacles and cross the mountains.

In the evening.

They came to an orchard.

The branches were full of heavy fruits that were golden and beautiful. They were like ripe mangoes that emitted a tempting fragrance that attracted all sorts of birds and small animals.

Some small and thin monkeys jumped around the fruit tree. As they ate greedily, they let out excited squeaks.

They ate a few bites of the fruit and threw it away. It landed on the ground and attracted all sorts of animals and even all sorts of insects on the ground.

Some ate skin, some ate meat, and some ate cores.

The various creatures in the forest were doing their jobs, helping their home, which they relied on to survive, clean the trash and maintain their health.

When Chu Xiaoye and his strange group walked into the lively orchard, the little animals that were eating harmoniously immediately quietened down and looked at them in a daze.

They did not seem to have seen these strange animals.

A few white rabbits stood upright, each holding a bright yellow fruit with their front feet. They stood beside them, draping their ears and looking at them curiously with their eyes wide open. They actually did not know how to escape.

Just as the brothers were about to go forward to catch it, Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at them.

They immediately stopped.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the little animals in the forest and found an empty space at the side, preparing to spend the night here.

Since these little fellows did not know them and were not afraid of them, they could rest here in peace.

Let the little fellows eat their fill here.

As long as danger came, they would act as their sentries and sound the alarm.

The little elephant was excited. It immediately walked into the orchard and started to use its nose to curl the ripe fruits on the ground. It stuffed them into its mouth and started eating big mouthfuls.

Tonight, it would eat enough.

Seeing that it was also eating these fruits, the little animals immediately relaxed and immediately became lively again, eating happily.

Not far away, a thick green vine was crawling on the ground, covered in dense green leaves.

When the sun set, it suddenly twisted its body and quietly crawled forward, winding around a fruit tree.
