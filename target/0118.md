Chapter 118: A Small Test

The night grew darker.

There was no sound in the bushes.

Maya also lay in the grass and fell asleep.

As time passed, Chu Xiaoye thought that he would waste his effort again tonight. Mei Mei, who was hiding on the furthest tree, suddenly widened her eyes and wagged her tail.

Chu Xiaoye perked up and immediately held his breath as he looked at the distant bushes.

Not long after.

The tall and dark figure walked over silently like a ghost.

Those dark and demonic eyes flickered with a cold light that made people tremble in fear.

Its aura was as powerful as ever\!

It walked over slowly, its cold gaze patrolling the surroundings and it was even more vigilant than before.

It even raised its head and looked at the tree.

Fortunately, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei had changed to another tree and were hiding on the highest canopy.

When it walked under the tree where Little Curly Tail was hiding, it suddenly stopped in its tracks, and a look of bewilderment appeared in its eyes.

It lowered its head and sniffed carefully under the tree. It seemed to have smelled something

Chu Xiaoye was tense and stared fixedly at its actions.

Could it have smelled Little Curly Tail?

However, this place was near the camp of the pride, so it was normal to smell lions.

Little Curly Tail, who was hiding on the tree, was naturally extremely nervous.

He finally knew why his brother made the warthog dig that pit.

He could not let this terrifying fellow discover him, or he would spoil his brother's plans.

The tiger stayed under the tree for nearly a minute before continuing forward.

He was still ten meters away from the trap\!

At this moment, be it Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, who was hiding in the bushes at the other side, or Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei on the tree, they were all holding their breaths. Their muscles were tense as they looked at it nervously\!

Their hearts almost stopped beating\!

The tiger continued forward\!

The tiger continued forward\!

They stared fixedly at it, muttering in their hearts.

However, when the beast reached a place only two meters away from the trap, it suddenly stopped.

It raised its head and looked at the bushes in front of it with its dark and cold eyes.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine hid inside and buried their heads tightly on the ground, afraid that this beast would see their bright eyes.

Time quietly passed.

That ferocious beast actually stayed there without moving.

It pricked up its ears, as if it was listening to something. Its dark eyes were always vigilant and careful as it searched the surrounding bushes.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was almost sure that this tiger's intelligence was definitely terrifyingly high\!

Perhaps, just like in the movies he had seen before, those damn science crazies had already injected human genes into its body and wanted to make it an orc\!

How absurd and terrifying this was\!

He could not let such a bloodthirsty fanatic who enjoyed killing live on this grassland\!

Otherwise, all animals would suffer\!

The resources on the grassland, be it plants or animals, were the precious living environment of all creatures here. They were not to be destroyed\!

And their pride was the true king of this grassland\!

They had the responsibility and obligation to use their own strength to maintain the ecological balance here\!

All invaders that did not belong to this grassland would be expelled or killed\!

Otherwise, their species and the species of other animals would be in danger of extinction\!

Therefore, this tiger had to die\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail, who was on the tree, could not help it\!

He was afraid that this ferocious beast discovered something. Therefore, he suddenly roared angrily and rushed down from the tree, wanting to chase this ferocious beast forward\!

It was only two meters from the trap\!

As long as it moved forward another two meters, it would fall into the trap\!

Little Curly Tail jumped down from the tree and landed behind this ferocious beast. He bared his fangs and roared ferociously.

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart\!

Indeed, the tiger immediately turned around and prepared to escape\!

Right at this moment, Qiqi and Nunu, who had already crawled into the hole to sleep, suddenly ran over from the camp in front\!

When they heard Little Curly Tail's cry, they thought that their brother was calling them to play.

Maya immediately chased after them.

When she saw the fierce Little Curly Tail and the colorful tiger that was as strong and majestic as the cold father, she was stunned.

That night, when Chu Xiaoye and the others were fighting here, she heard sounds. However, because she wanted to protect the two children, she did not dare to leave the camp, so she did not see this ferocious beast.

Seeing this now, she immediately felt a chill from the bottom of her heart and started to tremble unconsciously.

This aura was almost a terrifying existence that could crush her\!

She had never seen such an imposing beast\!

The tiger was about to escape, but at this moment, it suddenly turned around and pounced at Maya and the two young cubs. Its dark eyes were filled with bloodthirst and coldness\!

Maya was instantly terrified\!

Just as she was about to pick up a young cub and flee in panic, the upper body of the tiger suddenly sank down and fell into the perfectly hidden trap with a whoosh\!

"Whoosh—"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, who were hiding in the bushes at the side, rushed out immediately\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also surrounded it from behind\!

Just as they were about to run close to the trap, a deafening roar suddenly sounded from the bottom of the pit\!

The tiger actually jumped up from the bottom of the pit with a whoosh and suddenly jumped up. It jumped over Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei's heads again. With a few leaps, it instantly disappeared into the boundless bushes\!

On its abdomen was one of Seno's fangs, and on its right hind leg was a sharp branch\!

Its speed was still very fast\!

Maya and the two young cubs were dumbfounded and trembling.

Little Curly Tail was furious. Just as he was about to turn around and chase after the tiger, Chu Xiaoye hurriedly stopped him\!

One should not chase after a cornered enemy\!

Furthermore, this was a ferocious beast that was good at ambushing in the forest.

Its strength was terrifying to begin with, and it was currently in a violent rage. If it suddenly turned around to risk its life, the few of them would either die or be injured.

He did not want to lose any of their lives to kill an enemy.

It was not worth it.

Since the other party was injured, with its intelligence, it would definitely return to take revenge\!

Even if it did not take revenge, there was no food in this forest anymore. It was not good at looking for food on the plains. Therefore, it would definitely return to attack their pride.

As long as it came again, he had a way to kill it\!

Although he was a little regretful that he could not kill it completely this time, he at least injured it.

To be able to injure a fellow with such strength and intelligence was something that they should be proud of.

They were not weak\!

This was just a small test\!

The bottom of the pit was in a mess. Sharp branches fell to the ground, and some had already been broken.

From this, it could be seen how thick the beast's skin was and how strong it was\!

However, no matter how strong it was, it was afraid of being cheated.

Who was not afraid of being cheated?

Everyone was afraid of being cheated\!

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to continue nurturing the warthog and let it continue to dig holes.

Now, he, the handsome and cool cub, could finally stop being known for big smelly farts and be known for pits.

— I am the handsome and cool cub, Chu Xiaoye. I will speak for myself using one pit after another\!

He wanted to dig many, many pits\!
