Chapter 503: All's Fair in War

"I told you that you would regret it."

The black fog dispersed. Chu Xiaoye retracted his claws and took a few steps to the side to prevent this new queen from flying into a rage out of humiliation and continuing to attack.

Just as she had become the new queen in high spirits and was about to show her might, she suddenly lost to a lion in front of everyone. Furthermore, she lost miserably.

This feeling was probably very uncomfortable.

However, what did this have to do with him?

"I won."

He looked at the Queen.

Lanisi stopped vomiting and lay on the ground with her eyes closed. Her towering chest heaved violently, as if she was calming her emotions, or breathing in the fresh air to stop the disgust in her heart.

Finally, she opened her eyes and stood up.

"You win."

She looked at him and said the same thing.

Chu Xiaoye sighed inwardly. A queen was a queen. Not many could have such a big chest, oh no, a big heart.

"Then, according to the agreement, I should be free, right?"

He believed that this was a queen who placed great importance on promises and honor.

"Of course."

The Queen nodded.

"Thank you."

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head politely to thank her. Then, he raised his head and shouted at the stone house above, "Catherine, it's time to go."

This was the first time he was speaking to the lioness cub.

He believed that the other party could understand.

This was the home of the elves, not theirs. Furthermore, this place would soon be destroyed by the strong orc army.

They did not belong here.

Catherine jumped out of the stone house and landed on the top of the stone house on the ground. She continued to jump and was agile and agile. In a few leaps, she arrived in front of him.

The little lioness opened her mouth for the first time and mimicked him.

She had a name.

Her name was Catherine, and his king had given her this name.

She was very happy.

"Silly."

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes and brought her out of the arena.

They should leave.

Annie shouted from above and ran down the stairs in a panic.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not intend to wait for her.

She belonged here, not to the pride.

Annie fell in panic and rolled down the steep stairs. Fortunately, Vilis, who had caught up to her, grabbed her arm.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and left without looking back.

However, the iron door to the arena was not opened.

Chu Xiaoye stopped at the door, turned around, and looked at the Queen.

The Queen had already picked up her sword and walked over. Her expression was calm and her eyes flickered. Her tall and slender figure was perfectly displayed under the red armor.

The blood-like setting sun only had half of its face left, as if it was peeping at this beautiful and sexy young queen, wondering if it should land.

"You're going back on your word?"

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes, not hiding the killing intent in them.

Lanisi came in front of him and inserted the sword in her sheath. She looked at him calmly and said, "Lanisi will never go back on her promise. I just want to ask… why are you so cheap?"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

The noble and beautiful queen had cursed?

"All is fair in war."

Chu Xiaoye replied calmly.

The Queen stared at him with her blue eyes and still said, "You're despicable."

Chu Xiaoye did not want to continue pestering her on this question. He thought for a moment and said, "In this case, Your Majesty, think about it. If you fight the orcs, will you kill the other party at all costs, or will you fight the other party according to the rules?"

"I'm not an orc, and we're not mortal enemies. We're just fighting."

The Queen said with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye grinned and said, "However, Your Majesty, don't forget that during the battle just now, you said that you would not show mercy to me. Clearly, you want to kill me. Furthermore, I was betting my life in this battle. Therefore, the analogy just now was not wrong."

Lanisi fell silent.

Chu Xiaoye was not flustered and waited patiently.

At this moment, Vilis helped Annie over.

Annie looked at him with tears in her eyes, her face filled with grievance. "Ye, don't you want Annie anymore?"

"No."

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and said mercilessly.

Annie sobbed and grabbed his tail. She cried and said, "Even if you don't want Annie, I want to follow you\! Annie will follow you for sure."

Before Chu Xiaoye could slap her, Vilis had already pried open her little hand and said coldly, "Your Highness, you have to remember your current identity. You are an elf and a princess of my elf race. This is your home."

Annie suddenly looked at her and said, "No, Vilis, this is not my home. I… I'm just an impostor. I'm not the real Princess Annie. Everyone knows that."

"Annie."

Lanisi looked at her and said with a gentle gaze, "Don't be anxious. Soon, you will remember everything. You are my sister, the warrior and guardian of the elves. You will never leave."

Annie looked at her in a daze, her mind in chaos.

"Your Majesty, the sun has already set. The elven nobles and guards on the stands are looking at you and waiting for you to keep your promise."

Chu Xiaoye thought to himself.

At this moment, the sun had already set and night had fallen.

Although flames were lit around the arena, the light was still very dark.

Lanisi looked at him and was silent for a moment. Her gaze suddenly reflected the jumping flames and became bright. She said, "You're called Night, right? You just said that all is fair in war. Then, other than smelly farts, do you have any other cunning skills or schemes? For example, do you want to defeat ten of me, or even more of me? No, no, you might not be as good as me…"

After saying that, she suddenly shook her head and said, "You might not understand if I say this. This way…"

She walked to Vilis and Annie and waved her hand again, letting Denise, who was standing not far away, come over. Then, she said with a burning gaze, "Now, the few of us have suddenly surrounded you. If we all want to kill you, can you still use some cunning schemes to defeat us? Or can you save your life and escape?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her curiously.

The Queen's expression froze. She scratched her head and seemed to be a little vexed. "It seems that you still don't understand. It's not your fault. After all, you were only a lion previously. Your brain…"

"My brain is very good\!"

Before she could finish, Chu Xiaoye interrupted her coldly.

Then, he took a few steps back and sneered. "Come on, surround me\! The schemes in my mind will definitely make you doubt life\! My skills are definitely not just smelly farts\!"

"Alright\!"

Lanisi's eyes lit up and her face lit up. She immediately gestured for Alice and Danis to find their positions and surround him in the middle.

The four girls pretended to be enemies from left to right.

Lanisi pulled out the scimitar at her waist and Wei Lise grabbed the huge sword on her shoulder.

Denise and Annie did not move.

"Alright\! We can start\!"

The Queen held her scimitar and issued an order. Her eyes flickered with flames as she comforted him. "Don't worry. Just use your trick. We won't hurt you."

"Boom —"

With an explosion, Chu Xiaoye suddenly rushed into the sky\!

A huge black fog jumped out from behind him and rolled like a tide, instantly enveloping the four girls and not seeing the world\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Bastard\! You just said that your skills are definitely not just smelly farts\! You… Ugh—"

This was the Queen's angry voice.

Chu Xiaoye landed outside the encirclement and said calmly, "Yes, my skills are definitely not just smelly farts. There are also big smelly farts, big smelly farts\!"

Annie laughed inside.

Only she obtained immunity to big smelly farts and did not vomit.

As for the "big smelly fart" the king said, she probably could not be spared either.

After all, the king's fart was invincible in the world\!
