Chapter 89: Never Turn Back\!

"Roar\!"

The moment Chu Xiaoye approached, the female leopard bared her fangs and roared in fear.

Stop roaring\!

Chu Xiaoye did not stand on ceremony and slapped the female leopard's face.

The female leopard crawled on the ground.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

Seeing that this rascal actually dared to hit her mother, Belita immediately protested angrily.

Chu Xiaoye glared at her fiercely and raised his claws.

She immediately shrank her neck and closed her mouth.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked to the female leopard's side. He looked at the wounds all over her body and prepared to treat her.

At this moment, the female leopard suddenly jumped up with a whoosh and turned her head to bite him fiercely\!

She thought that this cub was going to start eating her\!

She was extremely terrified\!

Chu Xiaoye was frightened and hurriedly retreated to avoid her ferocious attack.

The female leopard fell to the ground, bared her fangs, and continued to roar at him in despair and fear.

With her intelligence, she naturally would not have thought that this cub was saving her.

Lions and leopards were natural competitors and enemies.

The reason why this cub chased away the three female lions was definitely because it wanted to monopolize her flesh\!

That was definitely the case\!

As for her daughter, this cub definitely wanted to deliberately raise her before eating her\!

Or rather, they would eat her when the dry season was at its most difficult.

How despicable\!

"Roar—Roar —"

The female leopard tried her best to make her roars and face more ferocious.

However, this cub did not look at her again.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left.

He left decisively with a cold face.

He had done everything that he should and should not have done.

Since this female leopard did not know what was good for her, he would let her fend for herself.

He was a lion, not a volunteer to save the dying and heal the injured.

Coincidentally, he had always been conflicted about whether to save this female leopard.

Forget it\!

He wanted to force himself to forget his humanity, stop being soft-hearted, and stop feeling pity for her\!

He wanted to become a true lion\!

He strode away and never looked back\!

Looking at his retreating figure, Belita was stunned for a moment before she hurriedly cried out miserably, "Roar\! Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not help but stop and turn around.

Belita's eyes trembled as she looked at him pitifully and then at her mother, looking at a loss.

She did not know what to do.

Chu Xiaoye stared at her for a while, then grinned and bared his sharp fangs. He glared fiercely at her and then quickly left\!

He wanted to warn her: Don't harass me anymore\!

He was a lion. He did not want to show mercy to a leopard\!

"Wu…"

Looking at his determined figure leave, Belita let out a helpless whimper.

Her mother was seriously injured.

She was also limping.

What should she do now?

The female leopard raised her head and rubbed her face. She looked at her lovingly, as if she was saying goodbye.

Be it cheetahs or leopards, it was difficult for them to survive after being injured.

Because they lived alone, after they were injured, they would be unable to hunt or dodge the enemy's sneak attack.

Now, the wounds the female leopard received were enough to take her life.

Even if there was food to eat, she would not survive until tomorrow.

The hot weather, the venomous flies, and all sorts of invisible bacteria would infect the deep wounds on her body.

She would not survive.

However, what should her daughter do?

She was dying and her daughter's leg was injured. How could she hunt and avoid the enemy?

She rubbed her daughter's head gently, feeling sad and desperate.

Belita leaned against her side, lowered her head, and was secretly sad.

She could feel her mother's body condition and her reluctance and worry.

The sun was vicious overhead.

The air was filled with the smell of blood.

The flies buzzed over.

A group of hungry wild dogs also followed the smell of blood and rushed over.

The bushes beside them rustled.

An old crocodile more than three meters long draped in armor swayed its body and climbed out.

It had not eaten for more than a month.

Its companions were dead.

And it was also struggling at death's door.

The female leopard struggled for a moment and stood up, but her entire body was in pain and she was frail. She no longer had the strength to escape.

Five hungry wild dogs ran over and surrounded their path, maintaining a certain distance from the old crocodile.

They were all drooling over the food in front of them and would never give up\!

This concerned their survival.

"Roar —"

Belita bared her fangs and protected her mother, her body trembling.

The female leopard also bared her fangs and faced the ferocious old crocodile.

The mother-daughter pair snuggled up to each other and faced this group of cruel and bloodthirsty killers in fear and helplessness.

The five thin and weak wild dogs were a little afraid and did not dare to go forward.

As for the old crocodile, it opened its mouth and bared two rows of sharp fangs as it approached them.

They could not escape.

The female leopard was seriously injured and Belita was limping.

Even if they could break out of the encirclement, they would not be able to escape the pursuit of the five wild dogs.

The crocodile was not slow on land either.

The mother-daughter pair leaned closely together, bared their fangs, and roared ferociously, but it did not have much deterrence.

The old crocodile swung its tail and suddenly jumped up. Its mouth was wide open and its gaze was cold and fierce as it pounced at them\!

In her fear, Belita could only raise her claws and mimic the cub to scratch the old crocodile's head\!

However, the old crocodile's reaction was extremely agile. It suddenly raised its mouth and sucked in the claw she swung out\!

The two rows of sharp fangs were about to close with a crack\!

The female leopard was shocked\!

"Chi—"

Right at this moment, a golden light suddenly cut across the old crocodile's head\!

The old crocodile was about to close its upper jaw when it spat out blood and flew towards the grass beside it\!

"Bang\!"

It fell heavily to the ground, leaving only the lower half of its mouth.

On its back stood the cub that had just left\!

He had a gnu's bladder in his mouth filled with water.

Of course, he also drooled.

When did he arrive? No one saw him\!

The old crocodile trembled in pain. It turned around and bit him fiercely.

Unfortunately, it forgot that it was left with a lonely lower jaw.

"Whoosh\!"

With a golden flash, its jaw was gone.

Blood sprayed\!

It twitched violently a few times and fainted.

When the five hungry wild dogs saw this terrifying scene, they no longer hesitated and ran away. They let out terrified cries, as if they were crying for their parents.

The leopard and daughter immediately froze in place, looking blankly at the terrifying cub in front of them.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye threw the water bag in his mouth in front of them, then turned around, raised his head, and left coldly.

His gaze was determined and he never looked back\!
