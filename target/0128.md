Chapter 128: The Fall of the King

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The back of the tiger hit the tree trunk heavily\!

The entire tree trembled violently from the impact\!

The moment Chu Xiaoye was about to hit the tree, he immediately released his teeth and rolled on the ground, narrowly avoiding it.

The tiger fell to the ground in a sorry state, its back dripping with blood and in pain.

"Roar —"

It suddenly roared angrily, jumped up, and pounced at Chu Xiaoye ferociously and hatefully\!

Chu Xiaoye got up and ran towards the trap\!

He looked up at the tree.

The furious tiger followed closely, its dark and cold eyes flickering with hatred\!

Seeing that the trap was getting closer and closer, Chu Xiaoye knew that with this tiger's intelligence, it would be very vigilant even when it was furious and impulsive.

As long as he showed any signs of making a turn or sprinting and jumping over, this tiger would definitely follow behind him. It was impossible for him to foolishly step into a trap\!

Therefore, when he was close to the trap, he immediately slowed down.

"Whoosh\!"

The tiger behind him indeed jumped up and pounced ferociously. It prepared to push him to the ground and choke him\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stopped in front of the trap, lay down, and quickly rolled to the side\!

When the tiger that had already jumped up saw this scene, it actually twisted its body in midair and landed in front of the trap with a bang\!

His front limbs and back legs were only a few centimeters away from the trap\!

The moment it landed, it jumped up again and without stopping, pushed Chu Xiaoye, who had just gotten up from the ground, to the ground and suddenly bit his throat\!

Those sharp teeth and dark eyes flickered with a threatening cold light in the night\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who had just rushed into the bushes, were shocked to see this scene. They hurriedly roared and rushed over.

However, it was already too late for them\!

"Whoosh —"

Right at this moment, an arrow suddenly shot out from a big tree beside him. With a "chi", it shot fiercely into the right eye of this tiger\!

"Roar —"

A terrifying roar sounded in the dark forest\!

The sudden intense pain made the tiger jump up and slap the arrow that was inserted into its eyeball\!

"Crack\!"

The arrow was immediately cut in half\!

Half of it was slapped to the ground and the other half was still deeply embedded in its eyeball\!

Taking this opportunity, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and bit its throat\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also pounced bravely\!

Little Curly Tail jumped onto its back and bit its spine\!

Mei Mei bit at its abdomen\!

However, this powerful tiger did not fall immediately. Instead, it suddenly roared and jumped up, landing heavily on the ground. Then, it rolled crazily on the ground\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were immediately thrown down\!

Only Chu Xiaoye still bit its throat tightly\!

Ordinary animals would immediately lose their ability to resist after being choked by lions and gradually suffocate to death.

Even hyenas with extremely tenacious life force were not excluded.

However, this tiger was exceptionally strong. After being bitten in the throat by Chu Xiaoye's two rows of sharp teeth, it could still swing its neck with all its might. Furthermore, it raised its claws and pierced fiercely into Chu Xiaoye's back\!

Just as its claws were about to tear open the muscles and fur on Chu Xiaoye's back, an arrow shot from the tree again with a whoosh\!

It hit its second eye\!

"Roar —"

It suddenly roared angrily and its entire body trembled. It hurriedly pulled out its claws from Chu Xiaoye's body and slapped angrily at the second arrow that was inserted into its eyeball\!

"Crack\!"

This arrow was broken again\!

An even stronger pain spread throughout its entire body from its eyeballs\!

Its two eyes were dripping with blood. They were both blind\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly loosened his teeth and rolled out. He retreated into the distance and gestured for Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to not go up again\!

The tiger had already lost its mind from the pain\!

As it roared, it swung its huge claws and slapped around crazily\!

One moment, he was jumping, and the next moment, he was rolling around crazily\!

Grass and bushes flew everywhere\!

Its huge claws slapped the tree trunk, causing the tree to tremble and leaves to fall.

The tiger's anger and craziness, as well as its terrifying destructive power, frightened Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

They had never seen such a powerful and terrifying animal\!

Even if he was blind, his combat strength was still terrifying\!

"Whoosh—"

Seeing the tiger running around crazily, Chu Xiaoye was afraid that all his previous efforts would be wasted again. He hurriedly endured the pain in his back and rushed up\!

He bit the tiger's tail and turned to run\!

"Roar —"

The blind tiger immediately turned around and chased after him crazily\!

Chu Xiaoye roared and provoked as he ran towards the trap\!

When he reached the trap, he suddenly jumped over\!

The ferocious tiger that had lost its mind had its face covered in blood as it roared and chased after him. Just as its front limbs stepped on the disguise on the surface of the trap, its body suddenly leaned down and with a whoosh, it fell into the trap\!

Then, its roar stopped\!

Chu Xiaoye stood on the other side of the trap and looked down at the bottom of the pit. His body was trembling slightly and his heart was still beating rapidly.

This beast was the most terrifying animal he had ever seen\!

His back was dripping with blood and almost torn open\!

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine, who had quickly climbed down the tree, ran over and stood in front of the trap. They looked at the ferocious beast at the bottom of the pit in fear and absent-mindedness.

They still had lingering fear\!

The tiger at the bottom of the pit was pierced through by the inverted arrows and the sharp blades and fixed there\!

It opened its mouth, and its eyes were badly mutilated. Its body was still twitching slightly and it was not completely dead.

It seemed to be unwilling to accept this and found it unbelievable.

With its strength, how could it die here?

It raised its head with difficulty, wanting to see the group of despicable and shameless little things above it.

However, its blinded eyes could no longer see anything.

Finally, it lowered its head and died completely.

The ferocious and powerful king of the forest finally lost to the future king of the grassland.

This was not unfair.

After all, its strength and intelligence were extraordinary\!

Beside the trap, other than Catherine, who was not injured, the three siblings were injured to varying degrees.

Other than the wound on Chu Xiaoye's back, his right foot was almost broken by the strong slap of this tiger.

He looked at the powerful king lying at the bottom of the pit with a complicated gaze, his heart filled with questions.

Suddenly, he looked at its thigh\!

On the right hind leg of this beast, there was actually a letter and a few numbers engraved\!

A-009\!
