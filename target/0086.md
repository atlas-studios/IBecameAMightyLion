Chapter 86: Golden Claws in Pairs

Silence.

The atmosphere was strangely quiet\!

This lion king that had come with a murderous aura was standing in front of him motionless.

His gaze was cold and deep.

The two sides faced each other in silence.

After a long time.

Finally.

Chu Xiaoye was a little impatient.

He put down his right claw and raised his left claw. He looked down at the golden color on the tip of his claw and was eager to pounce.

"Roar—"

Finally\!

Our Lion King could not help it\!

Seno was furious\!

He roared\!

He bared his fangs\!

He was finally going to explode\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately narrowed his eyes and waited solemnly.

"Roar—"

Seno charged ferociously to the side, circled around him, and charged towards the male hyena corpse behind him\!

Seno pounced on it and bit at the two halves of the male hyena's corpse. He was extremely fierce and roared continuously\!

A few minutes.

He turned around, his mouth full of blood. He raised his head and stuck out his chest, then left triumphant\!

He passed by Chu Xiaoye and seemed to treat this cub as a transparent lion. He did not look at him.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws ."…"

The night was very quiet.

When the tall and mighty figure of the lion king completely disappeared into the boundless night, Chu Xiaoye was jolted awake.

He turned around and looked at the male hyena corpse on the ground. Then, he walked out of this territory and left quickly.

At this moment, the figure of the lion king reappeared on the distant grassland.

Seno's eyes were terrified and he was trembling.

This hot weather makes our lion king sweat.

Of course, if he would sweat.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes.

Catherine had already returned early and returned to the camp with excitement and admiration.

She would not sleep tonight.

When they passed by the orchard, Chu Xiaoye looked up at the fruit tree that they had passed previously.

The little leopard was no longer on it.

He did not know where she went.

Forget it, he would spare her life.

Just as he was about to walk out of the orchard, he suddenly heard a slight movement above his head. A few withered leaves fluttered down.

He looked up at the tree.

On the highest branch, the leopard and her daughter were crawling.

At this moment, they were lowering their heads and looking at him with their eyes wide open, trembling.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"Go away\! Go away\!"

Belita's scream was accompanied by a mellow tremble, and her body was trembling intensely.

Her mother was also trembling non-stop.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and bared his fangs at the little leopard. He scared her before wagging his tail and leaving.

Since he was in a good mood tonight, he would not tease her.

The tips of both claws had turned golden. Although they were only a little bit golden, they were finally symmetrical.

This made him, who was a little obsessive and compulsive, feel much more comfortable.

His combat strength naturally increased.

Furthermore, he had just overcome his fear of an adult lion and was even full of fighting spirit. He wanted to fight that adult lion\!

Unfortunately, the other party did not fulfill his wish.

However, from today onwards, he would never have to fear any adult lion again\!

He finally took another step towards the path of becoming a Lion King\!

But.

What was with that male hyena?

Based on his understanding of hyenas during this period of time, even a stronger female hyena would never have such speed and reaction speed.

As for the male hyena, not only was it extraordinarily strong, it had also rebelled against other male hyenas and killed the hyena queen, ascending to the throne of the hyena pack\!

That fellow's intelligence seemed to be a little strange.

This was a little difficult for him to understand.

Back at the camp.

No one had gone to sleep.

The tragedy tonight made all the members of the pride sad and depressed.

The weak pride of the cold father finally attracted three new lives. Unfortunately, they withered overnight.

Even the usually cold father was lying not far away with his eyes closed. He did not sleep.

Clearly, this Lion King was not in a good mood.

Chu Xiaoye silently looked at Callie, who was still sad as she crawled through the bushes. He then turned around and looked at the pregnant Maya.

He felt that in the future, the rules of having children in the pride should be changed.

In the future, when the lionesses gave birth, they would stay in the pride and not go anywhere. That was the safest.

At least, that was how their pride should change.

Usually, when cubs were born, they were very fragile. The female lions were afraid that if they stayed in the pride, they would encounter the danger that other cubs would inadvertently bring, or the danger that came from the lion king and the wandering lions.

But now, Chu Xiaoye felt that they did not have to worry at all.

Because although he, Little Curly Tail, and the others were still cubs, they knew clearly how to protect and protect their newborn brothers and sisters.

Even if Little Curly Tail and the others did not know, he had a way to let them know.

As for the threat of the cold father and the other wandering lions, with him around, he naturally would not let them succeed.

Although the cold father would occasionally go crazy, he would not hurt his own children.

If the lionesses went out to have children alone, not only would they have to face the dangers of hunting alone, raising children alone, and bringing them back alone, they would also have to be careful of the threats of other carnivores.

If any one of them went wrong, he would regret it forever.

Just like Callie tonight.

Hence, Chu Xiaoye felt that he had to make Maya stay when she was about to give birth.

Of course.

If this lioness insisted on following the rules of the pride or was unwilling to stay because of her mother's instinct, he would bring Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to protect them often.

For the sake of the pride's long-term development, as a member of the pride, he naturally had to contribute.

Since he had the wisdom of humans, he could not waste it.

"Roar\!"

Aisha suddenly looked up at him.

She seemed to have smelled the blood on him and was calling for him to go over, as if she wanted to check if he was injured.

Chu Xiaoye did not go over. He hurriedly ran under the Baobab tree and climbed up. He pretended to be very tired and lay on the branch with his eyes closed.

He was like a child in his rebellious phase and was very disobedient.

This made his mother feel very helpless.

Aisha raised her head and looked at him gently for a while. She only relaxed when she saw that he did not show any signs of injury.

In the bushes at the other side.

Catherine bathed in the gentle moonlight and lay there quietly.

Her eyes were dark as she quietly peeped at the figure on the tree. As if she did not know fatigue, she looked at it for a long, long time until dawn.

On the other side of the river, the low growl of a wandering lion suddenly came.

They rose and fell endlessly.

From the sounds, there were at least three adult lions.

The cold father, who was resting with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes and raised his head to look at the distant hill.

The pregnant Maya suddenly woke up from her dream.

This dry season was not peaceful.
