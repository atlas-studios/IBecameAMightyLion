Chapter 74: Lion and Leopard

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail quickly climbed up, bared his fangs, and threatened her fiercely.

Belita's fur immediately stood on end as she let out a roar. With egg liquid and bird fur at the corner of her mouth, she bared her fangs and roared as she faced him.

Hey\!

He was quite bold\!

Seeing that the little female leopard actually dared to resist, Little Curly Tail was even more interested. He decided to teach her a good lesson\!

Just as he was about to rush up and swing his claws, the little female leopard suddenly roared towards the tree, looking very angry.

She seemed to be saying, "Bastard\! Take your brother away\!"

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment. He turned his neck and looked down at the tree with a stunned expression.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out to him to come down.

This female leopard was quite pitiful. It was bad enough that he often bullied her, but now, Little Curly Tail was also bullying her. He really could not bear to do so.

Looking at her miserable appearance as she dug out the bird's nest to eat eggs, it was obvious that she had not eaten for a few days and was hungry.

Back then, she had given him some prey for free.

Speaking of which, this little female leopard was quite nice to him. Otherwise, he would not have gone to save her that night.

Little Curly Tail looked suspiciously at his brother. Although he was a little puzzled, he did not hesitate and immediately retreated from the tree.

However, he was still a little unwilling. He called out to the young female leopard, as if he was saying, "Little thing, if you have the ability, don't call me brother. Let's fight fair and square\!"

Belita glanced at him arrogantly and ignored him. Instead, she grabbed the nest on the branch and dropped it on his head.

Little Curly Tail was furious. He slapped the nest on his head down and looked at her angrily, baring his teeth and roaring.

In the end, the nest fell vertically and happened to fall back on Mei Mei's head.

"Roar—"

Mei Mei was furious. She slapped the nest away and glared at him, wanting to fight him\!

Of course Little Curly Tail was not afraid of her.

But he was afraid of his brother.

This female cub was extremely despicable. Every time she could not defeat him, she would complain to her brother. How despicable\!

He did not want to fight a girl who only knew how to complain to her brother\!

It was boring.

He climbed down from the tree and ignored the lioness cub that was pretending to be strong. Instead, he followed his brother and picked up the fruits.

They had all seen this little leopard before. Mei Mei had wanted to compete in climbing trees with this little leopard back then, but her brother had forcefully brought her away.

They did not know what relationship their brother had with this little leopard.

However, from the looks of it, their relationship was not ordinary.

Could it be that her brother was going to treat her like the prey drying in the storage room and deliberately wait for this little leopard to grow a little bigger so that he could kill her and dry her up to keep her?

Yes, that was very possible.

The skin of the little leopard was very beautiful\!

Little Curly Tail thought that he had guessed his brother's thoughts and felt even more respect for him.

His brother was indeed more cruel than him\!

Chu Xiaoye climbed onto another fruit tree, bit a fruit on the branch, and tasted it.

It was a little sour.

However, there was plenty of water and he could quench his thirst.

Many animals could survive the dry season without a water source. Most of them absorbed water from fruits, leaves, or plants' roots.

Chu Xiaoye bit a few fruits and threw them down.

Little Curly Tail ran over and took a bite. He immediately grinned in jealousy and squeezed his eyes. He swayed his head and looked rather comical.

Mei Mei also ran over and picked one up with her mouth, chewing it. It so sour that her entire body was trembling, but she could not bear to spit it out.

The cool water in the fruits immediately made their thirsty throats feel much more comfortable.

Chu Xiaoye climbed down from the tree and ate another one.

When she took her first bite, it was indeed a little unbearable. However, she felt much better after taking a few more bites.

Belita lay on the tree and looked down at the comical appearance of the three siblings baring their teeth in pain from the sourness. She was overjoyed and let out mocking cries.

She seemed to be saying, "Idiot\! Idiot\!"

A dignified lion actually ate fruits like a monkey. How laughable\!

She had forgotten that they, leopards, were the most laughable.

Not only did leopards eat meat, they also ate all sorts of birds and even insects. Sometimes, they even ate cheetahs. They could be said to be the least picky omnivores on the grassland.

Just as Belita was laughing unrestrainedly, Chu Xiaoye suddenly spat out the fruit in his mouth and walked towards the fruit tree she was lying on.

The roar in Belita's mouth immediately stopped and she looked at him in panic.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and quickly approached her.

"Wu… Wuwu…"

Belita was instantly afraid and hurriedly started to beg for mercy.

Was this bad guy going to let out his smelly farts at her again?

How terrifying\!

She hurriedly closed her mouth and covered her nose with her claws, looking at him in fear.

Chu Xiaoye bit off a fruit from the branch at the side. Then, he crawled in front of her and used his claws to put the fruit by her mouth, looking at her threateningly.

He seemed to be saying, "Open your mouth\! Eat\!"

Belita was stunned for a moment. Seeing his fierce gaze and his fangs bared, she immediately did not dare to hesitate. She obediently opened her mouth and bit the fruit.

What a green and astringent fruit\!

This little rascal was doing this on purpose\!

This was revenge\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and told her to eat faster\!

Belita's body trembled, and she could only put on a bitter face and start chewing.

Immediately, an extremely sour juice filled her mouth\!

She could not help but shudder. She swung her head, grinned, and wrinkled her nose. Her eyes were squeezed into a line and her face was distorted. It was so sour that her entire body was trembling\!

She finally understood what these three little cubs tasted\!

However, her fruit was greener and sourer\!

This despicable bastard\!

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

This time, it was their turn to mock her.

Little Curly Tail jumped and jumped under the tree, laughing at her misfortune.

Brother is the best\!

He got back at her\!

"Wu…"

Belita let out a painful whimper, as if she was about to cry from the torture.

Chu Xiaoye reached out with his claws and plucked out the remaining fruit in her mouth. His gaze turned from fierce at first to gentle. Then, he raised his claws and rubbed her head to comfort her.

Belita was stunned and looked at him in a daze.

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and aimed his butt at her face. Then, he curled his tail.

"Pfft—"

An explosion suddenly sounded in the quiet forest, causing Belita's ears to buzz\! The wind blew at the fur on her face\!

Then, she saw darkness\!

"Whoosh—"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were under the tree, turned around and fled without hesitation\!

Chu Xiaoye climbed down the tree and left.

When they arrived at the border of the pride, Catherine was still standing there.

The female lion had already stopped breathing and was lying there quietly.

The mother and daughter were very close. Although they were so close, they could never touch each other again.

The silent farewell seemed a little sad.

Fortunately.

Chu Xiaoye had already used the little leopard to vent his anger.

It was just the natural process of death.

This was nothing.

Every animal and every creature had to experience it.

The lioness died of illness. They could not leave her here, let alone let the other animals nearby eat them.

Sometimes, a corpse during the dry season would destroy an entire pride.

He had to bury her.
