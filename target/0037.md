Chapter 37: Killer in the Night

The male hyena was terrified.

The cub's slash scared it out of its wits.

There was a burning pain on his head.

Fresh blood flowed down his face.

Its heart was filled with fear.

Its companion was bitten to death and it was slapped away. This terrifying little lion would be its lifelong nightmare\!

It ran out of the bushes fearfully and ran towards its territory.

That was the safest place.

No matter how powerful an enemy was, they would not dare to be impudent in their home.

"Moo—Moo—"

The cry of a water buffalo suddenly came from the territory.

The hyena was excited when it heard that. It increased its speed and ran over.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

His companions shouted.

Prey had entered their territory\!

For some reason, this unlucky water buffalo actually left the water buffalo herd and accidentally stepped into their camp.

This was a delicious meal\!

When the male hyena heard the cry, it ignored the wound on its head and immediately drooled as it ran over.

Only hyenas that participated in the hunt were qualified to share the food.

The hyenas were matriarchal and their ranks were strict. The status of male hyenas was generally lower than that of female hyenas.

Whether it was to enjoy food, other resources, or even mate, they were allocated according to their status.

As for those who had made contributions, they would naturally be given priority. In fact, they could even obtain the Queen's favor and become top dogs.

Therefore, many male hyenas had to put in their best effort and climb up.

At this moment.

The unlucky water buffalo was already surrounded by more than ten hyenas.

The other hyenas were rushing over one after another.

The ten-over hyenas did not attack. Instead, they cried out as they ran, deliberately exhausting the water buffalo's energy slowly.

Water buffaloes were huge and had a pair of sharp horns on their heads. They usually appeared in groups and were rarely seen alone.

Therefore, even lions did not dare to hunt them easily.

Unless they encountered the elderly, the weak, or the sick or when there was a severe lack of food.

Furthermore, they needed the lion to help before they had a chance to defeat them most of the time.

When lions worked together to kill water buffaloes, they had to expend their energy first.

Then, the lion would attack head-on and bite the water buffalo's throat, then use his weight to drag the water buffalo to the ground.

In the end, the female lions would surge forward.

Hyenas did not need to do that when hunting water buffaloes.

They mostly attacked from the back. Furthermore, they never waited for the prey to die before attacking together and eating the prey alive.

At this moment.

There were already more than twenty hyenas hunting this water buffalo.

The male hyenas, who were eager to perform, started to bite carefully under the barking of the hyena queen, Samantha.

Regardless of whether they bit it or not, every time they dashed forward, they would immediately retreat and not continue fighting.

As for this water buffalo, it was panting and exhausted from running around in circles.

The male hyena that had escaped from the bushes was especially active. Every time, it would quickly bite the water buffalo's thigh and jump away.

Its head was covered in blood and it looked ferocious.

Its encounter tonight made it understand that it could only live longer if it worked hard and climbed to the highest point.

It no longer wanted to be a scout\!

It wanted to have a large retinue\!

It wanted to eat the best prey\!

He wanted to live in the best place\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Queen Samantha's cry seemed to be encouraging and tempting, making it more brave and fierce.

When the other hyenas attracted the water buffalo's attention, it suddenly rushed up from behind and burrowed its head into the water buffalo's legs. It raised its neck and bit down hard\!

"Moo—"

The water buffalo suddenly let out a scream. Its two hind legs turned limp and it knelt on the ground.

Then, its two front legs trembled as it slowly knelt down.

The intense pain made it lose all its strength\!

It could not hold on anymore.

The other hyenas immediately rushed forward and started biting from behind it excitedly.

The male hyena did a great job and bit down on the water buffalo's testicles. It retreated from under the water buffalo and started wolfing down the food at the side.

Samantha, the hyena queen, ran over excitedly. She did not look at it but chased away the other hyenas behind the water buffalo. She occupied the good place alone and started biting\!

The water buffalo knelt on the ground and raised its head, letting out a miserable scream, but it could not move. It seemed to be numb from the pain.

In the grass not far away, Chu Xiaoye lay there motionless, quietly watching the scene of eating and slicing.

The scene of Gigi's death appeared in his mind.

His eyes were filled with hatred and killing intent.

However, he knew that he could not be rash now.

The thirty-over hyenas almost all came out to enjoy the sumptuous dinner in frenzy and excitement.

The air was filled with the strong smell of blood.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the Hyena Camp not far away.

There were also a few small hyenas wandering anxiously around the cave, letting out childish cries.

Since he knew about the hyenas' camp, he would become their nightmare starting tonight\!

The water buffalo's cries became weaker and weaker.

It turned around and stared at the group of cruel bandits with its watery eyes.

The hyena queen had already burrowed her entire head into the water buffalo's body and was greedily eating the internal organs inside.

The other hyenas were sharing the water buffalo’s sides.

After a moment.

The back half of the water buffalo's body turned into pieces of meat that entered the stomachs of the bandits.

Not even bones were left\!

The male hyena that had done a great job went to snatch another piece of meat. It quickly ran to the grass at the side and started eating.

It deserved it.

It started to fantasize about being chosen by the Queen, becoming a pretty boy, and walking to the peak of dog life.

Suddenly, it seemed to have sensed something\!

It let go of the flesh in its mouth and raised its head to look at the grass in front of it.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly jumped up from the grass. Like a bolt of lightning, it drew a beautiful arc under the moonlight and landed in front of it\!

Of course, it also bit its throat\!

"It's him… It's him… It's him again…"

The male hyena fell to the ground, its eyes wide with fear and shock, as if it could not believe it.

This cub had followed it to their hyena camp\!

It opened its mouth to sound the alarm, but its throat was blocked by the blood that was quickly flowing out. It could not make any sound.

Its heart was filled with despair and unwillingness.

It did not want to die yet.

It had yet to become a pretty boy or mate with the Queen. It had yet to reach the peak of dog life\!

Damn lion\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Under the terrified cries of its companions, it swallowed its last breath.

Chu Xiaoye let go of its neck but did not leave immediately. Instead, with a whoosh, he rushed in front of another female hyena at his fastest speed and bit its head\!

"Crack\!"

The female hyena's head was bitten to pieces\!

At this moment, the hyenas were in chaos. Some fled in panic, while others pretended to be weak.

However, none of them went forward.

They did not know that the one that dared to attack their camp and kill their companions was only a young cub\!

They looked at the cub in fear and then looked around in fear.

Soon, the previously noisy grassland gradually became strangely quiet.

The water buffalo had already stopped breathing and only a little bit of its corpse was left.

All the hyenas looked fearfully and quietly at the cub that was biting their companion.

Including their queen.

Chu Xiaoye put down the hyena corpse in his mouth, glanced at them coldly and disdainfully, and then turned to leave.

His steps were very slow, as if he was taking a walk.

No hyenas chased after him.

Soon, he walked into the distant forest and disappeared into the night.

Tomorrow night.

He would come again.
