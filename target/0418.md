Chapter 418: Untitled

The battle was continuing.

Although the hyenas were strong and fierce, they did not have much of an advantage under the impenetrable defense of Blue Eyes and the others.

The strength of Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others was not to be underestimated. One slap could send a hyena flying.

After a few rounds, the spotted hyenas that relied on their numbers and aggressiveness immediately started to shrink. They did not dare to rush up and die easily.

At this time, the hyena queen made orders forcefully.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and held his breath. He looked carefully at the spotted hyenas standing at the outermost circle. Towards the female leopard beside him molesting him while he was in danger, he did not move and treated her as air.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Many spotted hyenas ran around and let out noisy cries. Their size and movements were almost the same. For a moment, one could not tell which was the true hyena queen.

Chu Xiaoye widened his eyes and continued to wait.

The female leopard beside him twisted her body and became more and more impudent.

The hyena queen seemed to have given the order. The timid hyenas immediately roared and pounced forward\!

At the same time, the spotted hyenas behind also rushed forward like a torrent and bit.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others finally could not resist and started to fight their own battles. They were instantly caught in the torrent of hyenas and had no time to care about the others.

The cold father fought side by side with a few female lions and a few bloody wounds were immediately bitten on his body.

Under the hyena queen's orders, the more than 100 spotted hyenas started to fearlessly pounce on the pride, instantly bringing disaster to the pride\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye could not wait anymore.

Even if the cunning hyena queen had yet to appear, he had no choice but to go down and help his pride.

"Bang\!"

The moment he was about to jump down, he finally erupted. He flicked his hind legs and suddenly kicked the female leopard that had crawled under him away. Then, he flew down\!

A few spotted hyenas were attacking Aisha. A spotted hyena bit her thigh and a spotted hyena bit her back, dragging her to the ground.

The other hyena pounced forward and was about to bite her throat.

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye fell from the sky. Golden light flashed from his claws and he crushed the heads of two of the hyenas. Just as he landed, he suddenly raised his hind legs and kicked the hyena biting Aisha's thigh away\!

"Whoosh\!"

Before the hyena that was biting Aisha's back could escape, its entire head drooped down from its neck and it instantly died\!

Aisha's desperate gaze immediately turned to surprise. She got up from the ground and continued to fight.

Seeing that the hyenas around him were dense, aggressive, and difficult to resist, and that the members of the pride were covered in wounds, Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment. In the end, he prepared to take a risk and risk it all\!

"Roarâ€”"

A roar suddenly fell from the sky like an explosion\!

Then, a visible sound wave was like a huge wave. With a bang, it quickly spread in all directions like ten thousand horses galloping with unstoppable might\!

The few spotted hyenas that bore the brunt of the attack had just jumped over and were sent flying before they could land.

Just as many spotted hyenas were biting with all their might, they suddenly felt an explosion in their minds. They were instantly dizzy and their minds buzzed, losing all their strength.

The terrifying sound waves still surged out one after another\!

When the members of the pride heard the first wave of sound, they immediately stopped fighting and lay on the ground, covering their ears with their claws. At the same time, they opened their mouths. This was what Chu Xiaoye had taught them after using the Lion King's Roar to defeat the bats.

Before the hyenas that were attacking them could react, their vision turned black and they swayed as they fell to the ground.

The ten-over spotted hyenas at the front instantly bled from their seven apertures and died\!

The other running hyenas also turned limp and fell to the ground.

The leaves of the trees rustled like snowflakes falling. Even the branches swayed violently from the terrifying sound wave, as if they wanted to escape the tree trunk and fly away\!

Chu Xiaoye's roar was still continuing\!

The hyenas that had been noisy just now immediately quietened down. Some died, some fell to the ground, some went limp, and some disappeared.

This roar lasted for nearly five minutes\!

When everything around him quietened down, Chu Xiaoye's body turned limp and he felt dizzy. He fell to the ground.

He looked up and saw that the aggressive hyenas seemed to have fallen.

Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, more than ten figures suddenly jumped out of the forest beside him and let out roars\!

There were still more than ten spotted hyenas safe and sound\!

At the same time, a little further away, the hyenas that had fallen to the ground also swayed their heads and slowly climbed down.

These hyenas were not like those bats. Their bodies were extremely strong and they had evolved. Their resistance to the Lion King's Roar was naturally not something that those bats that relied on sound waves to fly could compare to.

Chu Xiaoye's lion king roar did have a great effect. It shocked the ten-over hyenas at the front to death and pushed the other hyenas to the ground, temporarily relieving the crisis of the other members of the pride.

However, this roar could not also deal a destructive blow to all the hyenas.

This was what he was worried about previously.

However, in that situation at that time, if he had hesitated any longer, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others, as well as the members of the pride of the cold father, could never have lasted until now.

Until this moment, the hyena queen did not seem to have appeared.

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and forced himself to stand up.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and the members of the pride of the cold father also stood up.

They also suffered some impact, but they were much smaller than the unprepared hyenas.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Under the impact of the lion king's roar, the ten-over intact hyenas suddenly roared together and chased away the hyenas that had just stood up from the ground, charging at the pride again\!

The hyenas' recovery ability was very strong. After shaking their heads a few times, they pounced forward ferociously again.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the members of the pride of the cold father were immediately surrounded again. However, this time, the other party's combat strength was greatly reduced, and they were not too affected. Their combat strength was still strong.

The cute violent bear and her son were especially fierce. They bit the heads of the spotted hyenas one by one. When they were surrounded by the spotted hyenas, they suddenly hugged each other and curled up. They quickly rolled on the ground, making the spotted hyenas unable to bite.

The ten-over unharmed hyenas did not participate in the battle. Instead, they suddenly rushed towards Chu Xiaoye together.

They seemed to have already seen that this young lion was the lion king of this pride. And the roar just now seemed to have exhausted the young lion king's strength.

He could not stand steadily.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place, his head still buzzing. The aftermath of the lion king roar still had not disappeared, and he had indeed exhausted most of his strength and spirit.

The Lion King's Roar was very effective for small animals, insects, and weaker animals. However, for these ferocious beasts with strong physiques and tenacious life force, it could not have much effect. Instead, it would make them temporarily lose their combat strength.

Chu Xiaoye was indeed very weak now.

Logically speaking, Little Curly Tail and the others should have already arrived at this time. However, why had they not appeared yet?

Could something have happened along the way?

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The ten-over strong hyenas rushed close with a murderous aura. Just as they were about to take the opportunity to pounce on him, the little girl's loud cry suddenly came from behind. "Bite them to death, Tibbs\!"

Chu Xiaoye turned around in shock and saw that the big black bear that had always been very terrified suddenly seemed to be assisted by a god. It roared and rushed over like a cannonball\!

"Bang\!"

The few spotted hyenas at the front were sent flying on the spot. Their brains exploded and they died\!

The big black bear went crazy. It carried the little girl and used its huge body to charge around. In an instant, it killed the ten-over aggressive hyenas and fled in panic, flying everywhere\!

The huge bear claw slapped a hyena away and it died on the spot.

The hard head suddenly hit and broke the bones of the two spotted hyenas. They lay on the ground and wailed\!

The little girl rode on it and hugged its neck tightly. Her face was red as she shouted excitedly, "Bite these baddies to death\! Bite them to death, Tibbs\!"

The big black bear became even more ferocious and violent.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and watched the scene in a daze, as if he had heard another voice: Annie, my talented beautiful female mage, show your magical talent. After I die, please turn my body into a toy bear so I can stay by your side forever. When you encounter bad people, please shout, "Bite them to death, Tibbs\!". I will immediately come out and help you bite them to death, okay? "

Was this the story of the beautiful Annie and the shadow bear, Tibbs?

"Whoosh\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was in a daze, the bushes behind him suddenly moved. Then, a figure shot over and pounced at him\!

A hyena that had been hiding in the dark for a long time\!

When Chu Xiaoye turned around, a figure covered in spots suddenly fell from above and pressed the hyena that had jumped out of the bushes to the ground\!

The male leopard, Blue, had long been waiting for it and was hiding above it\!

Seeing that the young lion king was weak and had become a lone lion, the hyena wanted to be the mantis stalking the cicada and kill it in one move, but it did not expect that there was already a sparrow waiting quietly above it\!

Was this female spotted hyena the queen of this pack?

Blue did not hesitate and bit the female spotted hyena's neck\!

However, the strength of this female spotted hyena could not be underestimated. The strength in its body suddenly erupted. Before Blue's sharp teeth could close, it twisted its neck and took the initiative to tear off a large piece of flesh on its neck, rolling away\!

When Blue stood up with its flesh in his mouth, the powerful female spotted hyena had already jumped up and retreated a few steps. It looked at him coldly, seemingly not reacting to the bloody wound on its neck.

Chu Xiaoye was a little shocked. This should be the hyena queen that had been hiding for a long time. It looked very strong.

"Roarâ€”"

Blue roared angrily and pounced.

The hyena actually escaped under his claws and sharp teeth, making this always confident male leopard feel extremely humiliated\!

The female spotted hyena's eyes flashed. It turned around and fled, charging towards the two warthogs fighting.

Blue roared and chased after her.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat and he suddenly felt that something was wrong.

When he turned around and looked behind him again, he happened to see a figure pounce on him. Before he could react, it bit his neck\!

However, this attacker did not seem to know how soft and smooth the golden fur on his neck was, let alone that there was a thick layer of armor on his skin.

Therefore, before the attacker's two rows of sharp teeth could pierce into Chu Xiaoye's flesh, they slid down from the golden fur with a crack and closed. Their teeth collided and bit empty air, causing their heads to buzz.

"Roar â€”"

Right at this moment, the female leopard and Belita jumped down from the tree and pounced at the attacker.

This was another female spotted hyena\!

Chu Xiaoye actually saw a faint scarlet spot on its back\!

"Bang\!"

Belita was slapped out by it\!

The female leopard had just pounced on it and was about to bite it when she was pushed to the ground\!

Seeing that the sneak attack had failed, the female spotted hyena turned around and ran.

Belita and the female leopard roared and chased after her.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye finally recovered a little and his strength was quickly recovering.

"Roarâ€”"

He hurriedly roared and told the female leopard and Belita to return quickly and stop chasing.

The leopard and her daughter were clearly no match for the female spotted hyena.

However, the leopard and her daughter ignored him and fought the female spotted hyena. They were rather agile.

Belita, who had just been slapped away, seemed to be fine and was still fierce.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a strong wind suddenly slapped from beside Chu Xiaoye\!

Before Chu Xiaoye could react, he was slapped in the head and sent flying\!

After flying for seven to eight meters, he fell to the ground in a sorry state.

Chu Xiaoye's head was in pain. He looked up with difficulty and saw that it was a normal-looking female spotted hyena.

However, at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that there were two scarlet spots on the female hyena's neck that lit up with a weak light. Then, they disappeared in a flash\!

This was the true hyena queen\!

When the hyenas rushed over together, she had used the cover of the huge hyenas to quickly hide in the dense bushes until now.

Everything around her, including the leopard hiding above her, was in her plans\!

Chu Xiaoye swayed his head a few times and got up from the ground. The strange heat in his body quickly flowed and healed the pain on his head.

This was the first mutant he had encountered so far that had two complete lights lit up on its body.

His claws became hot.
