Chapter 79: Venom

His brother had just died.

The reason for his miserable death was unknown.

He was caught off guard.

Seno Sr was sad and terrified, and he did not have any fighting spirit.

When he saw the pride of the cold father charging over with high fighting spirit, he did not hesitate and immediately left with the five female lions.

Their strengths were equal.

He did not want both sides to be injured.

The smart prides would not fight with the prides next door until they were both weakened. That would benefit the wandering lions wandering around the borders of the territory.

Seno Jr stayed in place as the price for invading this territory.

The pride of the cold father was aggressive and chased them out of the borders before returning triumphant.

Two corpses were lying on the grass.

A lion.

A Komodo Dragon.

Although the pride of the cold father was hungry, tired, and hungry, none of them dared to eat.

Lars paced anxiously around the Komodo Dragon, drooling.

Chu Xiaoye walked forward and stared at the wound on the Komodo Dragon's abdomen for a while, but he did not find any abnormalities.

The blood flowing out of the wound on the Komodo Dragon's neck was black.

However, the blood flowing out of the wound on his abdomen was red. Clearly, there was no venom.

However, he was not 100% sure if this corpse was poisonous.

Perhaps in this short time, other places might have been contaminated by the venom as well.

He did not dare to take the risk.

It was just food. At most, he would go back and eat jerky.

"Roarâ€”"

At this moment, the cold father roared sternly and told him and Lars to stay away from the corpse.

Clearly, the careful lion king would not let the pride eat the monster's corpse.

The cold father walked in front of Seno Jr's corpse and stared at it coldly. No one knew what he was thinking.

Perhaps he was relieved.

Or perhaps, he was sad because he thought of himself.

Since the corpse could not be eaten, he could only look for other prey.

Staying here would only waste his time and energy.

The sun had already risen.

The temperature rose sharply.

Even with the cover of the dense bushes, the heat was still unbearable.

The cold father left with the pride.

The forest finally returned to calm.

But.

The peace was quickly broken.

The two corpses lying on the ground were like a delicious feast that attracted all sorts of carnivores.

First, a leopard smelled and ran over.

Then, another few wild dogs came.

Not long after, a male hyena that was wandering nearby ran over.

The vultures that were paying attention to the movements of these carnivores circled in the sky for a while before landing.

A group of flies also flew over.

The two corpses had a lot of meat, so no one fought over them. They all cherished every second and quickly swallowed them.

Soon, the lion's corpse and the corpse of the Komodo Dragon were eaten clean.

Even the bones were devoured.

Everyone dispersed in satisfaction.

The male hyena passed through the bushes and walked to a desolate grassland, where it stopped.

Ahead was the territory of the hyenas.

It had once lived in that tribe, ate the least and did the most. It was bullied by all the female hyenas and male hyenas.

In the end, it was chased out.

It was dejected, lonely, angry, unwilling, and filled with hatred.

However, it still had to live.

It believed that one day, it would definitely be able to return to its race and be accepted by the Queen, becoming a top dog\!

It had to take back everything that had been snatched away\!

In the forest.

A group of flies that had eaten their fill continued to fly. They passed through the forest and the grassland and arrived at the territory of a group of water buffaloes.

On the other side.

A few wild dogs accidentally entered the territory of a group of wild dogs. Both sides started to chase and bite.

In the sky.

A vulture had just finished eating a feast. The blood from the corpse of the Komodo Dragon was still lingering on the corner of its mouth and claws.

It flew past the forest and the grassland, and saw another lush grassland.

On the grass, a herd of cows and sheep were happily eating grass.

A few black-skinned animals in red were holding long things and herding the cows and sheep, making strange sounds.

The vulture felt its body heat and its eyes burn. A strange force and emotion made it circle in the sky for a while before it fell.

It pounced at a young sheep, and its sharp claws easily pierced through its fur and locked its muscles and bones.

The little sheep let out a terrified cry.

The black-skinned upright animals quickly shouted and ran over.

The vulture flapped its wings and quickly dragged the little sheep into the sky. However, just as it flew a few meters, it started to slowly descend because it was too heavy.

The black-skinned upright animals had already run over ferociously.

The vulture had no choice but to give up on the delicious meal in front of him and flee quickly.

The little sheep was thrown to the ground. It struggled for a few times and let out childish and pitiful cries, but could not stand up.

The vultures had already left.

The Maasai ran to the little sheep and examined it carefully. They could only bring it back and make it a sumptuous meal.

In a city.

In a quiet alley, a dirty stray dog was rummaging through the trash can to eat.

At this moment, a patterned mosquito the size of a sparrow flew onto its body. Its sharp mouth quickly pierced its skin.

The stray dog's body trembled and it jumped up. As it rolled on the ground, it cried out miserably.

The huge mosquito, covered in patterns, drank a few mouthfuls of blood and left.

The stray dog felt its entire body itch, its head felt dizzy, and its body felt hot. It staggered out of the alley and onto the street.

A woman in high heels and heavy makeup passed by holding a poodle.

The poodle was wearing clothes and had a bow on his head. It looked very cute.

The stray dog was very envious and liked it.

Hence, it rushed up with a whoosh and bit the poodle's butt hard\!

The poodle suddenly let out a scream and jumped up.

As for its owner, the woman with heavy makeup, she was frightened. She hurriedly shouted and used the bag in her hand to slap the stray dog.

The stray dog had escaped. Its mouth was sweet and filled with the blood on the poodle's butt.

The poodle continued to scream in place, its body trembling and looking terrified.

The woman's heart ached so much that her eyes were filled with tears. She hurriedly bent down and hugged it in her arms. As she coaxed it, she called out to it, "Little sweetheart."

"Wuuu â€”"

Right at this moment, the poodle in the woman's arms suddenly took advantage of her distraction to her hand\!

The stray dog ran far away.

It felt its entire body heat up and its teeth itch. It really wanted to bite something.

The streets were full of people.

Its eyes were red. The hatred and resentment of being abandoned erupted like a torrent\!

It wanted to bite these treacherous, selfish, and disrespectful things to death\!

The vast grassland looked calm.

The pride of the cold father continued to look for food under the hot sun.
