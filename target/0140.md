Chapter 140: The Lion King

The little elephant walked very slowly.

Looking at its relaxed appearance, it seemed to be playing around.

Chu Xiaoye did not urge it. Instead, he focused on biting the three prey.

Now, his appetite was growing and his mouth was becoming pickier.

Other than the meat at the thigh and ribs of the prey, he basically did not eat anything else. He would throw it away after taking a few bites.

This made the Chino brothers, who were following behind, so happy that their mouths turned crooked\!

They ate a lot of food and thanked him profusely the entire way. They shook their butts with all their might, almost twisting their thin and weak waists. They were extremely fawning.

Chu Xiaoye did not chase them away, making them extremely grateful and excited.

They gathered their courage and approached the elephant, following behind it and loyally becoming two lion bodyguards.

After the sun set.

Chu Xiaoye rode his elephant up the hill.

However, just as they reached the hill, the hot night wind brought with it a strong smell of blood.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the small elephant's back and took a few steps forward. He immediately smelled the scent of an adult lion marking its territory.

He hesitated for a moment, but still jumped onto the elephant's back and let it enter.

The Chino brothers did not hesitate and immediately followed behind the little elephant. They looked warily at the surroundings of this territory, looking like they were ready to charge for their boss at any time.

A patch of bushes appeared in front of him. It seemed to be larger than the bushes in the territory of the cold father's pride.

A pride that could occupy an area here was definitely not ordinary.

Chu Xiaoye rode his elephant towards the bushes.

When they were about to approach the bushes, the corpse of a lion suddenly appeared in the grass in front of them.

The adult lion seemed to have just died.

He opened his mouth and widened his eyes. His entire body was covered in lacerations, and the entire spine on his back seemed to have been bitten off.

His entire body was dripping with blood.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at it and did not stop. He continued to command the little elephant and walked into the bushes.

The farting brothers were terrified by the miserable appearance of the lion king and felt their limbs go limp.

This lion king was so strong, but it was bitten to such a state. How strong was the other party\!

After walking into the bushes, the corpse of another adult lion appeared on the grass.

This adult lion died in an even more tragic manner. Its entire abdomen was bitten open and the internal organs in its stomach were completely eaten.

It widened its eyes and looked extremely terrified.

The two adult lions in this territory had been killed.

Then, there was no doubt about the strength of the enemy.

The lion, Chino, shivered.

Chu Xiaoye still rode his elephant forward.

"Roar—"

A roar suddenly came from the forest ahead\!

It was not the roar of a lion, but the terrified and furious roar of a lioness.

The little elephant suddenly quickened its steps, passed through a few bushes, and came to the forest.

In the empty space in front of him, a female lion was baring her fangs and retreating towards him covered in wounds.

Behind her was a young cub about five to six months old. It was baring its sharp little teeth and trembling.

Opposite the female lion were three adult lions with lush manes\!

Not far away, the corpses of seven to eight young cubs were lying on the ground.

Beside the cubs' corpses stood nine female lions in a daze.

At this moment, two more lions walked back from the forest in front with the corpses of two young cubs in their mouths.

These two lions had sparse manes and were clearly not as strong and tall as the previous three adult lions. They looked to be only two or three years old and were pseudo-adult.

However, compared to Chu Xiaoye, who had just turned a year old, they were naturally much older.

Obviously, the two of them were in cahoots with the three adult lions from before.

After biting the masters of the two territories to death, they were slaughtering the young cubs.

Now, only one cub was still alive under the protection of her mother.

However, it seemed that the mother-daughter pair could not escape.

Facing this ferocious and powerful alliance of lions, they were only making a pointless deathbed struggle. The other lionesses had long compromised.

When Chu Xiaoye appeared behind the lioness and cub on his elephant, the three strong adult lions opposite him were stunned. They widened their eyes and looked at him in shock.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he looked past them at the two adult lions behind them.

One of them had a sparse mane and cold eyes. The fur on its body was a little messy and there were a few scratches on its face. Clearly, he had been scratched while in battle just now.

This was his brother, Lars.

Lars bit the corpse of a young cub and stood in place, looking at him in shock. He clearly recognized him too.

The two brothers met under such circumstances.

Chu Xiaoye looked at this big brother with a complicated gaze and heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that he was doing quite well.

He had joined the team of these wandering lions and had already started fighting on the battlefield in advance to snatch territory.

It was indeed not easy to survive until now after being chased out of the pride by the cold father during such a cruel dry season.

This big brother's personality was indeed more adapted to this place than his.

Lars looked at him in a daze. He opened his mouth and threw away the cub's corpse in his mouth. Then, he looked at the little elephant under him. Finally, he looked at the Chino brothers, who were behind him.

He looked puzzled.

Normally, this brother was only one year old and would not be chased out by his father. But now, why was he here?

Furthermore, where was Little Curly Tail, who was always by his side?

The brothers should be together.

The two brothers looked at each other, thinking about something.

The three adult lions soon recovered from their shock. They immediately bared their fangs and roared at the young male lion riding on the elephant.

They thought that this young lion was also here to fight for this territory.

Although the Chino brothers, who were following behind the little elephant, were terrified, they had no choice but to take a few steps forward and protect the little elephant from left and right. They bared their teeth and roared at the three adult lions.

In order to continue eating and survive, they had to be brave and fight side by side with their boss\!

Seeing that there were terrifying enemies in front and behind them, the female lion and her daughter immediately froze in place, terrified and not knowing what to do.

Right at this moment when the battle was about to start, Lars suddenly took a few steps forward and walked to the side of the three adult lions. He growled at them, as if he was saying, "Big Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, this is my brother. He was also chased out by that old fart to wander around. Why don't we let him go?"

The three adult lions each looked at him, then looked at Chu Xiaoye again, and finally looked at the little elephant.

Their expressions seemed to be saying that they could spare his life, but this little elephant could be both eaten and rode on. It had to stay\!

Lars hurriedly raised his head and walked in front of Chu Xiaoye. He growled at him with a cold gaze, as if he was saying, "Alright kid, leave this little elephant behind. Go away\!"

His expression and gaze seemed like he was giving alms to this brother.

He was doing well now, so he naturally had the glory and feeling of looking down on others.

Although the two brothers did not have a good relationship in the past, they were brothers after all. This kid had once saved him from a crocodile's mouth. He could not watch helplessly as this kid was bitten to death by his sworn brothers.

"Roar—"

He saw that this kid was still riding on the elephant's back as if he did not hear him and was immediately furious.

Was he courting death and challenging the patience of the few sworn brothers behind him? Their ferocity was not a joke\!

The three adult lions bared their fangs again, their eyes showing ferocity.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the elephant's back and walked in front of this big brother. He raised his foot and rubbed his head to express his gratitude.

Lars was stunned, but he immediately roared and bared his teeth\!

This looked like he was a father touching his son\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and walked to the side of the lioness and her daughter. He raised his head and looked at the three lions opposite him, his eyes revealing a cold glint.

He seemed to be saying, "I want to take this mother and daughter away. Do you have any objections?"

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

"Roar —"

No, they had big opinions\!

The three adult lions and the pseudo-adult lion immediately roared angrily\!

Who did this kid think he was?

They bared their fangs and had fierce expressions. They prepared to pounce over and teach this brat who did not know the immensity of heaven and earth a lesson\!

Lars was shocked. He hurriedly turned around and walked over, roaring at his brother who did not know his limits and telling him to scram\!

Idiot\!

He was courting death\!

No matter how powerful you are, can you be stronger than these four strong adult lions?

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and took a few steps forward to stand in front of the lioness and her daughter. He looked coldly at the four lions that were about to erupt opposite him and habitually wanted to extend his claws.

However, there were no claws.

He turned his head and looked at the trembling, terrified, and helpless mother and daughter behind him. He remembered how his fearful his mother was and how she protected him and Little Curly Tail as the cold father fought a wandering lion.

He turned around and looked at the four ferocious butchers covered in blood again.

His two front palms were slightly hot.

At this moment.

The little elephant suddenly walked over and raised its nose, standing beside him with a fighting spirit.

The Chino brothers looked at each other and immediately walked over, standing beside them. They bared their fangs and looked opposite them fiercely.

Although they were afraid, they were also brave\!

Opposite him was the Lion Alliance, the ferocious and powerful Lion Alliance\!

And they were the Lion and Elephant Alliance\!

The strange and weak alliance of lions and elephants.

However, there were kings on the other side, and they also had kings\!

Their king was the true king\!

Their king was the true king of the grassland, the future king of lions, and the future king of all beasts\!

Their king was invincible\!
