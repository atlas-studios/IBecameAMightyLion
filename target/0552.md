Chapter 552: The Angry Queen

Of course, Chu Xiaoye would not leave.

Furthermore, he could not leave now.

He knew the guilt in Vilis' heart. If she had not insisted on saving her, this would not have happened.

However, this was everyone's decision.

Then, everyone naturally had to bear this outcome\!

He would not surrender, even if he died in battle.

Because he did not want to see something even more tragic happen in front of him.

When the orcs saw the elf girls in the trap, they let out excited roars and eagerly surrounded the trap to fish them up.

However, the female elves who fell into the trap did not lose their ability to resist.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's arrows shot out of the trap.

The two orcs fell to the ground.

The orcs were shocked. They roared and retreated. They wanted to throw weapons into the trap, but they could not bear to.

"Kill this kid first\!"

The orcs looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was leaning against the tree.

Chu Xiaoye held the sword and slowly closed his eyes. He took a deep breath and suddenly opened them again. When the orcs rushed up with their weapons, he suddenly spun quickly. The sword in his hand turned into thousands of sword shadows that wrapped his body tightly like a silver water curtain.

"Whoosh â€”"

Like a whirlwind, he rushed into the beast crowd\!

The orcs raised their weapons and broke them. Then, their heads or half of their bodies flew up.

The storm of man and sword becoming one wreaked havoc in the beast crowd, and no one could stop it\!

Vilis, who was hanging in midair, watched this scene in a daze.

This was her spinning storm, but it was not.

Blood splashed and heads fell to the ground\!

In the blink of an eye, the ground was covered in orc corpses\!

When the other orcs saw this, they were shocked and hurriedly retreated.

"Attack together\! Kill him\! Kill him\!"

The orc gathered his courage and roared as he rushed up.

However, the storm was still spinning fiercely. Its entire body was filled with rapidly spinning sword shadows. He could no longer see the person inside. If he was injured, he would die\!

Another group of orcs fell to the ground, either having their heads cut off, their corpses cut in half, or broken limbs.

"Shoot him with arrows\! Shoot him to death with arrows\!"

The orc standing in the distance roared\!

"Whoosh\!"

An arrow suddenly flew over and pierced through his neck.

The orc opened his mouth and fell to the ground.

A figure suddenly jumped out of the trap. It was tall, slender, and had silver hair that fluttered. It was like an agile deer that jumped lightly on the ground. Every time it jumped, the ice-blue jade bow shot out three sharp arrows with a whoosh\!

Every arrow would hit\!

The few orc archers fell to the ground\!

"Catch her\! Catch her\!"

The orcs brandished their weapons and rushed towards the silver-haired girl.

As Denise retreated to open up a distance, the icy blue jade bow in her hand shot out sharp arrows.

The orcs that chased after him fell to the ground one after another.

Hence, no one dared to chase after him again.

At this moment, Denise ran back again, the icy blue jade bow in her hand still ringing non-stop.

On Chu Xiaoye's side, the orc corpses were piled on the ground.

He seemed to have turned into a killing god that could come and go freely in the beast crowd. The sword in his hand danced tightly and was as fast as the wind. The orcs could not dodge or escape\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise jumped onto a big tree, wrapped her slender legs around the branch, and hung there upside down. The bow in her hand vibrated and two arrows were fired at the same time, breaking the two ropes that were hanging Catherine and Vilis\!

As soon as Catherine landed, she rolled and jumped up. She rushed into the beast crowd like a bolt of lightning. Her silver claws danced and her eyes were cold. She instantly became another god of death\!

Vilis landed on the ground and immediately rolled to her sword. She picked it up and dragged the huge sword as she rushed into the trap.

Soon, Lanisi, Fei'er, and Doya were saved.

In the blink of an eye, less than half of the two hundred orcs were left.

The female elves shared a common enemy and rushed up.

"Go\! Go quickly\!"

The orcs were finally terrified and no longer had any fighting spirit. They hurriedly fled in all directions.

It was clearly a win-win situation, but they suddenly lost miserably. Not only did they not understand, the female elves were also a little stunned for a moment.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's arrows flew quickly in the night and accurately pierced into the orc's body.

When their arrows missed, the remaining ten-over orcs had already fled without a trace.

However, they could not escape.

Like a ghost, Catherine suddenly appeared from all over the tree, from the bushes, above, and on the ground, cutting open their stomachs.

Their war beasts and those strong lions were also not spared.

Denise and Fei'er picked up the arrows in the orc's quiver and were about to chase after them to help when Catherine returned covered in blood.

She was not injured, but her eyes were already red from killing. Even when she looked at these familiar female elves, she bared her fangs and revealed cold killing intent.

Fei'er was so frightened that she hurriedly hid behind Chu Xiaoye.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's face was pale and his entire body was aching and limp. He was almost exhausted.

He almost exhausted all his strength and could not even stand up.

He leaned against the tree and panted heavily, about to fall asleep.

However, he had to wake up.

It was not safe here.

He used his sword to prop himself up and wanted to stand up, but he almost fell.

Catherine came to his side and wanted to carry him, but she was panting and exceptionally tired.

Lanisi hurriedly walked over and squatted in front of him. "Night, I'll carry you."

It was naturally best to be carried by the Queen.

However, Chu Xiaoye looked at the tall silver-haired girl and said, "Denise, it's your turn to carry me."

He was the one who carried her on the grassland previously. Now, it was time for her to repay him.

Denise wrapped the jade bow in her hand with a cloth and handed it to Fei'er. Then, she walked over and squatted in front of Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye lay on her back and asked curiously, "The trap is so deep. How did you jump out? Is it because your legs are long?"

Denise carried him and did not say anything.

Fei'er took credit at the side and said, "Sister Denise only jumped up because she stepped on Fei'er's head. If not for Fei'er's long legs, she definitely could not do it."

That was the truth.

"We can't stay here for long. Let's go\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately said.

They left from another path and avoided the path that the orcs had just fled.

When they were walking, Lanisi leaned over and looked at Chu Xiaoye faintly. "Night, why do you want Denise to carry you and not me? Is it because Denise has longer legs and is prettier than me?"

Denise looked in front of her, as if she did not hear anything. However, Chu Xiaoye's sharp eyes saw that her small ears moved, and she should be eavesdropping.

"Yes."

Chu Xiaoye wanted to tease her, but he was afraid that she would be angry. He could only tell her the truth. "You're the queen. I feel uncomfortable being carried by you. Furthermore, I'm injured. That's all. Don't think too much."

Hearing this, Lanisi was even angrier. She looked at him resentfully and said, "Night, we're already like this. Do you still treat me as a queen?"

Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "What happened? Your Majesty, don't talk nonsense. We didn't do anything."

Lanisi was really angry. She turned her head and quickly walked in front, ignoring him.

Although the two did not have that kind of relationship, she had seen what needed to be seen, touched what needed to be touched, and even kissed. Now, she actually said that she had not done anything and wanted to go back on her word. How could she not be angry?

"Denise, did I say something wrong?"

Chu Xiaoye asked weakly.

Denise was silent for a while before saying, "Yes."

Chu Xiaoye hugged her neck and buried his face in her waterfall-like silver hair. He rubbed it a few times and said, "What did you say wrong?"

Denise ignored him.

Everyone was very tired.

After walking for more than two hours, Chu Xiaoye said, "Stop and rest. We'll continue during the day. In our situation, if we don't rest well, we'll definitely be finished if we encounter those orcs again."

Denise placed him under the tree.

Chu Xiaoye did not come down. He listened carefully and pointed to the right. "Go there. There should be a stream there."

Everyone was hungry, thirsty, and covered in blood. They indeed needed water at this time.

Fei'er and Catherine ran in front.

Denise carried him and walked with Doya.

Lanisi walked alone at the side, still angry. She pretended not to hear Chu Xiaoye calling for her.

Before long, a stream really appeared in front of him.

Fei'er could not wait to squat on the rock in the water. She held the water with both hands and drank it in big mouthfuls. Seeing that they had come, she immediately said excitedly, "What sweet water. Lord Night's ears are really agile, like dog ears."

"You're asking for a beating\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared but ignored her. He jumped down from Denise's back and ran to the river. He lay down and drank water in big mouthfuls.

After everyone drank the water, Chu Xiaoye walked downstream, took off his clothes, and jumped into the water.

Catherine ran over and jumped down.

Chu Xiaoye carefully washed the blood on his body and warned the female cub to stay away.

Catherine could not stand and could only use her claws to scratch. Her claws were extremely sharp, and Chu Xiaoye did not want her to suddenly touch something.

Catherine felt a little wronged, but she obediently stayed away and played by herself. She sank and floated up one moment.

After playing it a few times, her ears suddenly pricked up and she narrowed her eyes to look at the water in front of her.

A snow-white and slender figure swam down from the stream, as light as a fish. He swam past her and towards her king.

The red hair fluttered under the water and wrapped around her slender body, like a mermaid underwater.

Catherine narrowed her eyes and watched. She wanted to stop her but was hesitant. In the end, she let her pass.

Chu Xiaoye was bathing happily with his back facing her when he was suddenly hugged by a pair of snow-white arms. He was so frightened that his body trembled. He raised his fist and was about to hit her hard.

Fortunately, he stopped when he saw the familiar red hair and blue eyes.

The Queen, who was still angry, hugged him tightly and pulled him into the water.

"Wait\!"

Chu Xiaoye had just said two words when he sank with a whoosh.

On the water not far away, Catherine watched in a daze and did not have the courage to stop him.

The girls upstream were still playing and splashing the water, as if they did not know that their queen had already become a soft and fierce beautiful fish. She was entangling a young man, venting the grievance and anger in her heart.

Did he not do anything?

Alright, he had done everything now.
