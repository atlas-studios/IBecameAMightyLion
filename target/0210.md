Chapter 210: Head Cut Off With One Slash\!

"Whoosh\!"

Under the lion king with mixed fur's shocked gaze, the male leopard suddenly jumped out from the water\!

In his mouth, he was biting the head of a sea python\!

It turned out that another sea python was hiding under this waterhole\!

The sea python's thick body struggled violently in the water, wanting to wrap around the male leopard's body, but it could not breathe. It could only twist its body in pain and slap the water.

"Crack\!"

With a crisp sound, blood splashed everywhere\!

The male leopard bit off the sea python's head and jumped up.

The sea python, which had lost its head, immediately twisted and slapped crazily in the waterhole. The blood that it sprayed out soon dyed the water even redder.

The male leopard spat out the sea python head in its mouth and shook the water stains on its body. It had a calm expression, as if it had done something insignificant.

With his agility and strength, he could even kill the five-meter-long crocodile, let alone such a sea python.

He knew the weakness of these crawling things and knew the tricks of sneak attacks. As long as he was given a chance, he could kill them with one hit and make them unable to resist\!

He could climb trees, swim in the water, and run. He was an outstanding hunter who had fully developed.

But.

He knew better than anyone that there was a young fellow here who was stronger than him.

The sea python in the waterhole finally stopped rolling and died.

The male leopard kicked the head of the sea python under its feet into the waterhole, then raised its head and looked at the big tree.

The mixed fur lion king stood at the side and looked at him in a daze.

This fellow was even more impressive than he had imagined\!

And that female cub\!

The lion king turned around and looked at Catherine. He was secretly shocked. The lioness cub's performance just now had really impressed him.

His attacks were ruthless, his movements were swift, his claws were sharp and accurate, and he had a brave and steady personality.

He had a composed expression that he had expected long ago.

This was definitely a lioness cub with endless potential and boundless future\!

If he could join his prideâ€¦

The mixed fur lion king's eyes lit up and it was excited. Just as it was about to praise it, another baboon fell from the tree. With a bang, it smashed heavily to the ground and died on the spot\!

Two rows of deep teeth marks appeared on its head\!

Obviously, it had been bitten by the sea python at the top of the tree.

The remaining three baboons were shocked. They hurriedly retreated and crawled down, letting out angry and terrified roars.

As for the thick sea python, it was still wrapped around the top of the tree. It lowered its head and opened its mouth, revealing its sharp fangs and letting out a fierce threat.

It looked down on them and had sharp fangs and poisonous fangs. The three baboons could not do anything to it.

The male leopard raised its head and looked at it for a while, feeling a little hesitant.

In this situation, he had no chance of winning.

His most powerful killer move was to take advantage of the enemy's carelessness and kill them in one move, making the enemy unable to react in time.

The sea python hiding under the waterhole just now was like this. The other party did not expect him to suddenly jump down, so he gave him a chance.

If this sea python was under the tree, it would be fine. He could completely avoid it and suddenly attack with lightning speed.

Now, the other party was on the tree, always vigilant. There was only one way. He still needed to grab the tree trunk tightly. He could only use one claw and one mouth. The chances of him killing the other party with one move were not high.

He did not need to take the risk of being bitten by those two rows of poisonous teeth.

The mixed fur lion king looked up at the arrogant sea python and was shocked and furious. It roared continuously and ordered the remaining three baboons to charge forward and attack.

However, the three baboons had already been scared out of their wits. They only dared to crawl on the tree trunk and roar with their heads raised, not daring to take another step forward.

The mixed fur lion king circled under the tree anxiously and could only look at the male leopard.

Other than the baboon, only this male leopard knew how to climb trees. With his skills, he should be able to handle the sea python.

However, the male leopard ignored the lion king.

He looked intently at a big tree not far away.

Catherine also looked over.

The mixed fur lion king was furious. Just as it was about to order him to climb up the tree to kill the enemy, it suddenly realized that something was wrong.

Why had the young lion disappeared?

He immediately raised his gaze and searched the surroundings, but there was no sign of him.

"Roarâ€”"

He immediately roared angrily\!

That useless little trash must have fled in fright after seeing this bloody battle\!

Damn it\!

He had to catch that bastard and let him have a taste of having his head explode\!

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, just as he finished roaring and had not had time to search yet, Catherine suddenly rushed in front of him and slapped him. Her cold gaze seemed to be roaring angrily, "Shut up\!"

The mixed fur lion king was furious. It immediately bared its fangs and raised its claws, preparing to teach this little thing who did not know the immensity of heaven and earth a lesson\!

However, Catherine ignored him and raised her head to look at the big tree not far away.

The lion king was stunned and subconsciously raised its head. It followed her gaze and looked at the tree.

Then, his claws immediately froze as he looked at the top of the big tree in shock.

The tree was more than ten meters away and was one of the tallest trees in the vicinity. At this moment, the young lion that had disappeared actually quietly appeared at the top of the tree\!

"That kid knows how to climb trees too???"

"But why did he climb so high?"

"Is there something wrong with your head? There are no enemies on that tree\!"

"Bastard\! He must have been scared out of his wits and fled to the tree to hide\!"

"As a male lion, he is not even as good as a lioness or a leopard\!"

Just as the mixed fur lion king was furious and was about to roar and reprimand him, a scene that stunned him suddenly appeared\!

"Whooshâ€”"

The figure suddenly jumped up from the top of the tree. Then, like a hawk that was quickly landing or a bolt of lightning that cut through the sky, it flew close in the blink of an eye and flew towards the sea python wrapped around the tree\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

The sea python was lowering its head and opening its mouth to provoke the three baboons below. It was not prepared at all and its head was cut off\!

Its head splashed with blood and fell to the ground.

Its body was still wrapped around the top of the tree, and its upper body was twisting back and forth, as if it was still provoking the three baboons below. It did not react at all.

Chu Xiaoye passed by this big tree and did not stop. With a whoosh, he landed on a branch of another big tree not far away.

Then, using the elasticity of the branch, he jumped up again and landed on the branch of another big tree beside him. Then, he flew out diagonally and continued to fall. He grabbed another branch and slowly landed after removing the force layer by layer.

In the end, he landed steadily on the grass with a bang, causing a few water stains.

Although he was long-winded, his series of actions were actually smooth like flowing water\!

In the blink of an eye, he flew over from a big tree more than ten meters away and landed on the ground. At the same time, while flying, he cut off the sea python's head with his claw.

There was almost no pause in the middle\!

At this moment, when he landed, the body of the sea python whose head had been cut off on the big tree turned limp and slowly let go of the tree trunk. Then, it fell.

From taking off, killing the enemy, and landing, it was so fast that the three baboons on the tree, the other lions, and the two warthogs could not react.

They did not even know that the sea python that fell from the tree was done by this young lion.

Even the three baboons crawling on the tree did not see his act of cutting off the sea python's head. They only felt a figure fly over their heads. Then, the sea python that was opening its mouth to provoke him lost its head.

They thought it was a big bird.

At this moment, the three baboons were still crawling on the tree, baring their fangs and not coming down. It was unknown if they were frightened by the sea python or if they had yet to react to the scene in front of them.

Before Chu Xiaoye could jump, he had already seen his mixed fur lion king. At this moment, the claw that was raised above his head, preparing to teach Catherine a lesson, froze for more than ten seconds before naturally landing on his head. He scratched his head and quietly put it down.

Chu Xiaoye walked over calmly.

In order to not let the sea python on the tree discover him and to quickly land from top to bottom, he sneaked onto the big tree more than ten meters away.

He swore that he really did not do it to be cool.

Although Catherine tore the strange fish's mouth with her claws and Blue jumped into the water to bite off the head of the sea python, looking very cool and taking away his dignity as a lion king, he did not care.

He walked in front of the sea python's corpse, lowered his head, and sniffed the smell of this sea creature, wanting to remember this smell.

However, the smell on the sea python was very faint, as if it had already merged with the smell of this forest.

There was clearly no chance to search for them by scent.

He raised his head and looked at the tall and mighty mixed fur lion king in front of him. He felt that there was something wrong with this fellow's gaze. Could he be gay?

Chu Xiaoye lowered his tail, circled around him, and walked to Catherine's side, aiming his butt at the female cub.

This lioness cub was safer.

"Ji ji\! Ji ji\!"

The pen bird that was the size of a bee suddenly jumped out of the lion king's thick mane and started to chirp. It was clearly recording something and looked very excited.

It seemed to have widened its horizons today.

The mixed fur lion king was shocked and its gaze immediately turned grave and serious.

He was the leader of this team\!

His contributions could not be less than that of the other members\!

What was he so pleased with? Didn't he just know how to climb trees and jump?

In the face of absolute size and strength, these fancy skills were trash\!

Just wait and see\!
