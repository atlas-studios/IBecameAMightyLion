Chapter 249: Mafia Alliance

Lars.

His big brother.

The young and vigorous brother's personality was similar to that of the cold father. When the dry season arrived, the cold father chased him out of the pride and made him go wandering alone.

Chu Xiaoye originally thought that after joining the Lion Alliance, he would have his own territory, his pride, his brothers and family in the future. However, he never would have thought that he would end up like this.

Under the bite of the two wandering lions, Lars had already given up on escaping.

However, he did not admit defeat or compromise.

He planned to use his remaining strength to maintain the lion's last dignity.

His roar was filled with anger and unwillingness.

Like most wandering lions, his life would wither before he reached adulthood.

A terrifying aura suddenly enveloped the two wandering lions.

When they raised their heads, their bared fangs, fierce faces, and hoarse roars froze at this moment and fell into silence.

"Bam\!"

They lay on the ground, feces and urine flowing. They trembled and their souls flew out\!

The huge fear made their minds blank and their bodies unable to control themselves. The terrifying aura crushed their bodies until they turned limp and could not muster any strength.

When they saw this terrifying team, they did not even have the courage to escape.

They lay on the ground, letting out terrified and pitiful cries.

Lars was also stunned at this moment.

He got up from the ground and stared at this group of giant species that had come from nowhere, then at the young lion standing at the front. He was stunned for a few seconds, feeling that this young lion was a little familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere.

However, he was sure that he had never seen the circle of golden fur on his neck.

Yes, after running around for the past few days, the golden fur on Chu Xiaoye's neck had become a full circle.

It was like a lion's mane, but it was not as lush as a mane. There was only a very thin circle, and even Chu Xiaoye had yet to discover it.

Lars stared at the strange-looking young lion in front of him. The more he looked at it, the more familiar it was and the more shocked he became.

He seemed to smell a familiar scent.

He seemed to have guessed something.

However, he did not dare to confirm it.

Until Chu Xiaoye walked in front of him, lowered his head, and rubbed his head affectionately. When he looked at him familiarly, his body suddenly trembled and he was stunned. He was really sure.

He was really his younger brother\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was a head taller and much stronger than him. Although the fur on his body was a mixture of brown and gold, it was smooth and neat, filled with luster, like a noble.

Furthermore, it was a noble surrounded by many powerful bodyguards.

As for him, he was as thin as a match. He had not eaten a proper meal for months and was covered in scars and dirt. At this moment, for a corpse that was about to rot, he was being beaten to the ground by two wandering lions and bullied at will, like a pitiful and miserable tramp.

Lars's entire body was stiff as he looked blankly at his younger brother. Then, he looked at the group of powerful followers behind him.

Of course, there were also the two beautiful female lions.

He knew one of them.

Back then, he had bullied her so brazenly, disliked her, and underestimated her. Now, just by standing there quietly, she made him feel an inferiority complex that he could only hope for.

Catherine shifted her gaze and did not give her former brother any sense of pressure, nor did she humiliate and resent him because of her past humiliation.

She could only sigh and rejoice in her heart.

She looked at the figure, her heart filled with gratitude.

Lars slowly lowered his head, feeling absent-minded, trembling, and at a loss.

Chu Xiaoye seemed to have forgotten the unhappiness between them back then. As if they were brothers catching up, he rubbed his head and gestured for him to follow him home.

Go home?

Lars suddenly looked up at him.

There had never been such a word in his memory.

A lion that had left its home would never return home.

In order to continue their race and to prevent inbreeding, they instinctively left their homes and went far away. From the day they left, they would never return to their former land or see their former family.

The female lions that were chased out of the tribe might set up a new tribe nearby, but most of the male lions would stay away.

During this period of wandering, he struggled every day for survival. He was terrified every day and was chased away by other lions. He was hungry every day.

However, he never thought of going home.

Now, his brother had actually invited him home. This made him even more at a loss.

He could go home?

Could wandering lions like them, who had been chased out by their father, really go home again?

Lars did not doubt that as long as they dared to return, their cold and heartless father would bite them to death. He would never show mercy\!

The fear for his father was engraved in his bones and could not be shaken off.

Lars thought that this brother in front of him was also chased out by his father back then.

However, this brother had gathered so many subordinates now. Furthermore, they were all extremely strong and terrifyingly big. Any one of them could slap their father into a bloody mess and kill him.

Therefore, this brother had the strength to return now.

Could it be that he wanted to go back and take revenge, chase his father away, and occupy the pride and the territory over there?

No matter what, he would return home in glory and dominance.

Therefore, facing Chu Xiaoye's invitation, he did not hesitate and immediately agreed.

So what if he was his brother's subordinate?

The most important thing was to survive.

He had long had enough of this life of constant fear.

Lars agreed and lowered his head. As a subject, he rubbed his brother's head respectfully and expressed his willingness to follow and respect him as king.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the hippopotamus's corpse and gestured for him to eat first.

Lars was already extremely hungry. At this moment, he could not care less about his face. He immediately ran over and wolfed down the food.

He had never eaten food so peacefully and happily like today.

As for the other two wandering lions, they were still lying on the ground, trembling even more.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and had never thought of doing anything to them.

It was all to survive.

After Lars finished eating, he brought the team and continued forward.

In the night sky, a bright moon hung. Just like those nights when he fled in a sorry state, it looked at him quietly from above and shone that light on him.

Chu Xiaoye's heart was as gentle as the moonlight.

He walked into a panic and returned in a hurry.

The further they went, the more anxious they became.

The changes on the grassland had already made Chu Xiaoye unable to recognize the scenery he passed by when he was escaping.

However, the river was still the same river.

They followed the river, winding forward.

This night was not too hot.

However, it was not easy for the lions on the grassland.

They had to persist in patrolling and constantly let out low roars to warn the wandering cultivators who were wandering nearby with ill intentions.

In the bushes, the roar of the cold father was low and strong.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were patrolling the vicinity.

The atmosphere of the pride was not relaxed. Instead, it was nervous and uneasy.

A month ago, a pride of Mafia alliances formed by seven adult lions came to this grassland from afar and started a bloody massacre.

Many territories were snatched; many lions died\!

Hundreds of young cubs were slaughtered, and many female lions were even eaten alive\!

The seven lions were cruel, strong, and extremely violent. In a short month, they killed more than a hundred lions and female lions and occupied a large territory.

However, they did not stop fighting and slaughtering. They were still approaching.

On the grassland, the lion's heart was in panic. Every day, there were all sorts of tragedies of wives and children being separated, fathers and children dying.

Many former majestic lion kings had either died in defeat or become wandering ghosts. They fled everywhere in panic.

The competitive Little Curly Tail had once gone to the vicinity to find a lion to fight every once in a while.

Be it the wandering lion or lion king, he had dealt with them before, so he quickly obtained the news and knew that such a ferocious lion alliance had appeared on this grassland.

On a certain night, when he walked far away to fight a famous lion king, he saw the destruction of the super pride with his own eyes.

The strength and cruelty of the Mafia alliance terrified him for the first time.

He immediately returned.

From that night on, he had been guarding his territory and patrolling every night. He never went out again.

With his strength, he could have long opened up borders and expanded his territory.

However, for the safety of the pride, he did not move.

That was because he and Mei Mei knew that the only thing they should do now was to protect this territory, protect this pride, and wait for their brother to return.

This was their home and their brother's home.

They did not want their home to change owners when their brother returned. Their family was no longer around.

No matter what, they would not let their brother down.

This was their responsibility\!

Under the moonlight, Little Curly Tail followed the border. As he walked, he looked up at the distant darkness.

The desolate cry of a jackal sounded from the distant grassland.

The oncoming night wind carried a faint smell of blood.

The cold father's roar spread throughout the entire territory.

Suddenly\!

Little Curly Tail smelled an unfamiliar and dangerous aura\!

At the same time.

Mei Mei's roar suddenly sounded at the edge of the bushes not far away\!

A terrifying aura came from the air\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail suddenly roared angrily and shot towards the bushes like a bolt of lightning in the night\!
