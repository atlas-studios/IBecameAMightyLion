Chapter 223: Mother's Sacrifice

For animals.

Violence was the only way to resolve things.

When Chu Xiaoye slapped each of the male brothers, they immediately became obedient.

Chu Xiaoye first used snow water to mix with saliva to clean the scars on their bodies. Then, he found a thick tree trunk, hollowed out the middle, and made a water container.

Then, he started to eat the snow on the ground mouthful by mouthful, making saliva medicinal juice, and spit all over the container.

The brothers felt a little disgusted watching this, but they could only lie on the ground and not dare to move.

They would never have thought that so many saliva compounds were actually prepared for them and that they had to drink a few mouthfuls every day.

Their mother, Letty, was even more obedient and docile than they were.

Of course, it was not because she was slapped by Chu Xiaoye.

With her intelligence, she naturally knew that this young lion was saving her two children.

Her heart was filled with gratitude and hope.

Chu Xiaoye made a total of two water containers. After filling them up, he placed them in the cave. Then, he looked at the female lion and expressed that this was the best he could do.

Letty hurriedly walked over, lowered her head, and rubbed his head, expressing her sincere gratitude to him.

Then, she walked in front of the two brothers, licked their heads, and brought them into the cave. She instructed them to hide here and remember to drink water every day.

The two brothers looked at the mixture of saliva in the two containers and were shocked. This thing was actually for them to drink\!

Although they were resistant, they would never disobey their mother.

Mother's word was law.

They should just do as they were told.

Letty looked at them lovingly and walked out of the cave. She looked at the young lion in front of her.

Obviously, they could not return yet.

According to the rules, after the chosen lion of the grassland mated with the lionesses on the snow mountain, he still had to go to the frontline and fight side by side with the team on the snow mountain.

This looked supremely honorable, but not many could return alive.

Letty did not want to bring this young lion to his death.

She thought for a moment and decided to bring him back to her territory first. She would send him away in a few days.

The snow mountain was actually the same as the grassland. Every animal had its own tribe and territory. Their lifestyles were generally the same.

However, they had to recruit soldiers every year. Every tribe had to send a certain number of members to join the army and guard the territory.

The snow mountain was not just a mountain. It was formed by many continuous and overlapping ice mountains.

The region here was many times larger than the grassland, especially the middle area surrounded by ice mountains. All sorts of animals lived here.

Behind the ice mountains was a large grassland with animals living there too.

Therefore, the territory near the sea had an endless supply of young teams every year to resist the sea enemies with the local animals and guard their common home.

Letty's tribe was made up of two lions, six female lions, and a few young cubs. Every member was a high-grade white breed born and raised here.

Therefore, the gray-haired cubs she gave birth to were not liked. After they fell ill, they started to be chased by the lion king brothers.

The reason why she mated with the lion of the grassland back then was because their tribe had received the orders from the upper echelons of the snow mountain. Either a lion would join the army, or a female lion would be chosen to reward the victor of the grassland and complete the responsibility of changing their genes.

The Lion King brothers did not want to join the army, afraid that they would never return. Therefore, she was chosen.

However, her efforts were not rewarded. Instead, she started to be disliked by the two lions and even the other sisters.

Letty did not care.

She only hoped that her two children could survive.

Therefore, she had to protect this young lion.

No animal's territory allowed their own species to trespass, and her species was the same.

However, their territory was big enough. The pride mostly lived on the other side, so she planned to hide this young lion at the border.

When the mission ended, she could send him away.

However, it would take at least a week.

Because the mating between a lion and a lioness had to be that long.

Sending him away too early would arouse suspicion.

This time, she took the initiative to volunteer to save her two children.

Of course, this also made her pride dislike her even more.

It did not matter.

As long as there was a glimmer of hope, she would never give up on her children.

Soon, they walked out of the forest and came to a boundless icy plain.

This was the border of their territory.

The ground was still filled with the aura left behind by the lion king. Clearly, he had just been marked for a few days. He should not be coming over in the next few days.

Leti brought Chu Xiaoye to a place filled with giant rocks.

These rocks were covered in snow and a thick layer of ice condensed on the surface. It looked like huge snowballs were piled here.

Letty brought him to a cave with ease, signaling him to hide inside and not run around.

She needed to hunt for food, for her children, and for this young lion.

Before that, she had to do something that made her feel conflicted and guilty, but she had no choice.

She wanted to kill the pen bird that had tipped her off.

It was her friend.

However, she had no choice but to do so.

If that pen bird spread the news, not only would this young lion be in danger, her two children might not be able to survive either.

Therefore, she could only steel her heart.

When she left quickly, Chu Xiaoye walked out of the cave and looked outside in confusion.

What was he doing?

He did not do anything and did not do anything with this white lioness. Why did he have to hide here pitifully like a fellow who had done something wrong?

Was he going to hide like this for a week? Was he going to be misunderstood by Catherine, Blue, and the others?

He was very unhappy that he had done a good deed but ended up being treated like this.

However, if he left now, he would not be the only one to be punished.

Just as he was feeling depressed, a few angry roars suddenly came from the icy plain not far away.

Then, a group of huge white lions chased after two familiar figures and ran over quickly.

Chu Xiaoye looked over and realized that the two figures being chased were the young female lions from before.

"Roarâ€”"

The roar was deafening\!

A huge lion that was comparable to a water buffalo suddenly caught up from the back. With a light leap, it passed the white lions and pounced angrily at the sisters.
