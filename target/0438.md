Chapter 438: Untitled

After dawn.

Chu Xiaoye immediately set off with the pride and walked towards the grassland at the foot of the mountain.

They had originally planned to stay here for two more days and wait for everyone's injuries to heal. However, their short stay last night had already attracted the suspicion and dissatisfaction of many animals in the forest.

After all, that was their territory.

Every day the pride stayed there, they would be uneasy. It was difficult to guarantee that they would not attack together.

Chu Xiaoye's ambition was not here. The green grassland at the foot of the mountain was his goal. Therefore, he could not be bothered to fight them again. Just as the sky lit up, he left with the pride.

The members of the pride were no longer like before. Although they were injured yesterday, after a night of rest and recuperation, walking was not a problem.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and brought the pride down the mountain slowly, admiring the scenery in the forest along the way.

The little girl was wearing a snow-white dress and riding on the back of the big black bear. Her beautiful golden hair was lazily spread behind her and fluttered in the wind. Her exquisite little face was filled with curiosity and excitement. She did not look like a pitiful little girl who had fallen into a herd of wild beasts and could not survive. Instead, she looked like a little princess who was accompanying wild beasts and playing around.

However, this loli and beast were beautiful and rough. The combination of white and black was a beautiful and striking scene in this deep forest full of ferocious beasts.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but turn around and look a few more times, but he was caught by the little girl's sharp gaze. He could not help but laugh and shout, "King, do you want to talk to Annie?"

Chu Xiaoye did not turn around again and ignored her.

The big black bear swayed its short tail and turned its head in a fawning manner. It looked at the little princess riding on its back and beamed. "Tibbs wants to."

"Hmph\!"

The little girl snorted proudly, raised her chin, and turned her head away.

The big black bear was not angry. It still grinned foolishly and walked steadily, its eyes filled with love and flattery.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but turn around and peep again. He could not understand the relationship between this pair. How did it form? Could it be that they were destined to be together in this world?

The little girl was wearing a thin dress and did not seem to feel the cold. Her already snow-white and tender skin had been exposed to the wind and rain along the way. Not only did it not become dim and rough, it became even fairer and more exquisite, delicate and charming like flawless porcelain. Her blue eyes also became brighter and more spirited.

This small and delicate human girl had already become full of life and tenacity from her fragile and sickly self when she first came. Just like them, she was not afraid of the wind and rain.

Chu Xiaoye originally thought that she would die halfway if she could not follow the team. Now, he knew that he had underestimated this little girl, humans, and a weak but tenacious life.

The human world would definitely be more suitable for her, but she might not be unable to adapt to the world here.

Who was born strong and who could adapt to their environment from the moment they were born?

Chu Xiaoye looked at the big black bear under her.

Perhaps, this little girl's future journey and growth were more smooth and unbelievable than he had imagined.

Then, let's wait and see\!

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye finally brought the pride to the foot of the mountain.

The foot of the mountain was not a grassland. It was still a lush, ancient forest that towered into the clouds and emitted all sorts of rotten smells.

Many animals naturally lived in the forest bordering the grassland.

Every animal might have its own habitat or territory.

The place where Chu Xiaoye and the pride landed was the territory of a group of wild dogs.

As for why the wild dogs were not in the grassland but in this ancient forest, who knew?

However, although there were many wild dogs, they could not resist the pride at all. Even the second brother of the grassland, the hyenas, could chase them until they cried for their parents. Therefore, the wild dogs knew their limits. They roared a few times from afar and fled with their tails between their legs.

This group of wild dogs was much taller and stronger than the previous wild dogs, but they were much weaker than the animals Chu Xiaoye had encountered on the way. For them to be able to survive in the gaps surrounded by strong enemies, they clearly not only knew how to escape, they also groveled and wagged their tails to find a backer.

The scent of other animals was still lingering in the forest, and it was very fresh. This meant that there were not only wild dogs stationed in this territory.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to have a conflict with other tribes for the time being, but he clearly could not hide.

It was almost night and they could not continue traveling. Even if they changed places, they would still encounter other animal groups. It was the same.

Since they had crossed mountains and rivers to come here, they naturally had to come here to snatch territory. Then, battle was inevitable.

If they continued to retreat, everyone's fighting spirit and ambition would probably be gone.

Chu Xiaoye instructed everyone to rest in place. He, Little Curly Tail, and the others jumped onto the surrounding trees and monitored the wind and grass in the surrounding forest from afar.

However, until midnight, he did not see the wild dogs returning.

Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the others rest. He also narrowed his eyes on the tree, but he did not fall asleep. He still pricked up his ears and listened to the surroundings.

Suddenly, an extremely soft sound entered his ears.

Chu Xiaoye opened his eyes and looked down at the tree.

The female lion that had lost to him in a duel was acting suspiciously. She left the camp quietly and walked towards the forest in front.

"Does she not want to fulfill the bet and want to escape secretly?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her figure clearly, but he did not get up to chase after her.

This was a test to begin with.

If this lioness really wanted to leave, she would leave. He did not want a member of his pride to have their heart elsewhere.

He was about to snatch the territory and fight and deal with the various natives here. Before that, he naturally had to expel all sorts of unstable factors.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and narrowed his eyes, watching as the figure quietly disappeared into the forest. There was still no reaction.

If there was a chance to meet again next time, he promised that he would not show mercy\!

Towards these ungrateful and treacherous people, he naturally had to kill them\!

Chu Xiaoye was not angry at all.

He stood up, jumped down from the tree, and quickly chased after her.

Since she was a traitor, she could not blame him for being cruel and not protective of the fairer sex\!

She had to admit defeat\!

Since you want to leave, leave behind what you lost\!

Chu Xiaoye did not care for her body, but since he had painstakingly wasted so many smelly farts to win, he naturally could not throw it away for nothing.

From his previous life to this life, he had never been a person or lion who liked to waste\!

"Whooshâ€”"

He increased his speed and rushed up like the wind.
