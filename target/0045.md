Chapter 45: The Baboon's Corpse

After a moment.

Almost all the thirty-plus baboons lay in the surrounding bushes\!

Only one or two were lucky enough to escape. They rushed out of the bushes and ran towards the distant grassland in a hurry\!

But.

The ferocious and furious poisonous bee army did not intend to let them go. They immediately gathered into a black cloud and chased after them ferociously\!

The miserable cries in the bushes did not last long.

The terrifying venom soon anaesthetized their nerves and muscles, and then entered their hearts, killing them completely.

The poisonous bee army charged forward.

Chu Xiaoye, who was hiding on the tree, still did not dare to move.

After waiting for half an hour, he carefully twisted his neck and observed the situation below. Then, he prepared to go down the tree and leave.

Suddenly, he smelled a familiar and dangerous aura\!

He suddenly raised his head and looked up\!

On the two branches above his head, the leopard and daughter pair had already laid there silently at some point in time\!

At this moment, the two pairs of amber eyes were looking at him strangely\!

His body trembled and he almost jumped up from the tree\!

This was what was called being shocked\!

"Roar\!‚Äù

Seeing that he had discovered them, the leopard and her daughter immediately bared their sharp fangs and stared at him fiercely.

At the same time, their bodies were trembling slightly.

He looked exceptionally terrified.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay any longer. He immediately lowered his butt and guarded against the female leopard's sudden attack. He quickly retreated from the tree and fled\!

He was so thirsty. He wanted to drink water\!

At this moment.

Aisha had already brought Little Curly Tail, Xi'er, and her daughter to drink water by the river that did not have any crocodiles and walked up the hill.

Their mouths were dry and their bodies were weak. Although they were very worried about his safety, they had to replenish their bodies with water first.

When he ran away with the baboon king in his mouth, Little Curly Tail was about to follow. However, he remembered that his mother seemed to need more help.

Little Curly Tail also believed that his brother would definitely be able to escape the baboons' pursuit.

Xi'er drank the water and felt a little better.

However, she was still very slow.

Mei Mei followed closely beside her.

Aisha and Little Curly Tail could only slow down and wait for her to come along.

They were all very worried about Chu Xiaoye's safety.

However, they had to send the injured Xi'er back to the camp first.

With the protection of the lion and the other lionesses, they could stop other carnivores from taking the opportunity to hurt Xi'er.

"Roar\!"

Right at this moment, Little Curly Tail suddenly jumped up and ran forward excitedly\!

A familiar figure ran over\!

However, he ignored Little Curly Tail's enthusiasm and did not greet Aisha and the others. He ran past them and quickly ran down the hill.

Chu Xiaoye was so thirsty that his throat was about to emit smoke\!

This damn weather\!

The water level of the river decreased a lot again.

Many crocodiles revealed their backs and continued to hide in the water.

Two strong gnus left their tribe and came to the river, seemingly wanting to drink water.

However, they stood on the shore, hesitating.

In the river in front of them, there were two grayish-brown objects floating. They were motionless, like wood.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them from afar and knew that they were two crocodiles.

Looking at the hesitation of the two gnus, he seemed to have heard their conversation.

"Hey, I say, what are you looking at?"

"That fellow is a crocodile, do you believe me?"

"I don't believe it. That is just a piece of rotten wood floating in the river\!"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and felt that he was a little crazy from thirst.

Why would such a scene appear at this time?

He walked to the river, found a place without any wood, and drank the water carefully.

Even if there were no floating pieces of wood, they had to beware of bloody mouths that suddenly popped out.

Little Curly Tail ran over happily and rubbed against his body in a fawning manner. He even stuck out his tongue to lick him.

Chu Xiaoye was already very tense and was always paying attention to the water surface. At this moment, he was distracted by him. He could not help but raise his hind legs and kick him to the ground with a bang, making him chew on a mouthful of dust\!

Little Curly Tail got up from the ground in a sorry state, but he was not angry. Instead, he looked at his hind legs in admiration and tried to kick them too. In the end, he could not kick them high or use much strength. Instead, he lost his balance and fell a few times.

He only knew that many prey would defend themselves like this, but he did not expect that even lions could deal with the enemies behind them like this\!

If he learned his brother's move, he would no longer be afraid of those despicable hyenas\!

He decided that he had to follow his brother in the future and continue to learn those strange actions diligently\!

"Whoosh\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was carefully drinking water, there was a sudden wave by the river not far away\!

A crocodile jumped out\!

One of the two gnus that were hesitating by the river previously was suddenly bitten in the front leg by the crocodile and dragged into the river\!

The other one turned around and ran in fright.

The waves churned and many crocodiles swam over.

Chu Xiaoye took the time to drink water.

After drinking the water, he brought Little Curly Tail up the hill.

Aisha, Xi'er, and her daughter were waiting for them on the hill.

Aisha looked at him lovingly. She came over and rubbed his head, stuck out her tongue, and helped him comb his fur.

Xi'er came over and rubbed against him gently.

If he had not stepped forward bravely at the critical moment, bit the baboon king and brought the baboons away, they would have been doomed.

The two female lions never would have thought that he would actually explode with such terrifying strength and speed at that moment\!

Even if the lion was present at that time, he probably would not know what to do.

However, how did he escape danger just now?

Where were the angry baboons?

Mei Mei leaned over in a fawning manner and rubbed her head against Chu Xiaoye's butt. She was about to extend her tongue to lick him when Little Curly Tail slapped her away.

Her brother disliked being licked the most. Other than her mother, he would get angry at whoever licked him\!

The female cub had been rejected so many times, how could she not understand?

How stupid\!

The sun was scorching hot.

They could not stay here for long.

Aisha quickly brought them back to the lion's territory.

However, when they returned, they realized that it was quiet. Not only was the lion and the other lionesses gone, but the ground was also in a mess, and the smell of baboons lingered\!

Aisha and Xi'er were shocked.

Could it be that the furious baboons had come to take revenge on the lions?

Where were their king and the other sisters?

Chu Xiaoye did not climb up the tree immediately but walked straight towards the bushes at the back.

The baboon corpses all over the ground were covered in preservatives.

He had to take the time to hang the corpses on the trees and dry them to prepare for the dry season.

At this moment, the baboons' corpses were filled with bee venom. No carnivores would come and eat them secretly, right?

As for the leopard and her daughter, they would never eat it secretly.

Their food was much more abundant than that of their pride.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei thought that he was going to the forest at the back to pick branches again and hurriedly followed him eagerly.
