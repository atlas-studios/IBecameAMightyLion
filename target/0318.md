Chapter 318: The Battle Begins

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye had already brought his team and hid in the bushes hundreds of meters behind the black lion army.

Standing on the tree with dense leaves, not only could he see the black lion sentries, he could also see the female lions and young cubs. He could even see the vanguard of the black lions at the front clearly.

The evening wind blowing from ahead carried a strong and powerful lion aura.

The black lion army was already in formation and ready to go.

They only waited for the sun to set and night to fall.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and stared motionless at the black lion army with high morale and a murderous aura. He was also waiting for the last moment.

The sun was setting on the horizon and it was about to fall.

The black lion king, Balo, bathed in the golden setting sun and looked at the distant grassland. He was filled with pride and swore to lead his Evernight army to trample this grassland and let the endless night cover the sky above this grassland\!

The tall and strong lions stood neatly behind him with high fighting spirit.

The female lions and young cubs looked at him in admiration and excitement from behind, as if they could already see his black mane floating on the entire grassland, flying amid the cries and despair of the enemy.

Balo stuck out his chest and made himself look even more mighty, strong, and confident.

Tonight would be the great day that their black lion tribe would truly rule this grassland\!

The other side was very quiet.

Perhaps he was resting, perhaps looking for prey everywhere, or perhaps he was terrified and waiting for them.

A mob had long peed their pants in fear and fled. Now, even if they gathered together again, what could they do?

When they saw him surging away with the black tide, they could imagine that the other party's formation would instantly collapse. The pride that had once fled in fear from his army would flee in fear again\!

Of course.

That young lion king could not be underestimated.

He only needed to bring this group of strong lions and pounce on the young lion king, preventing it from condensing the pride. Everything would be settled.

Finally, the sun set.

The night came slowly, and killing intent quietly filled the air.

Pairs of dark eyes flickered in the darkness and looked at him uniformly.

Balo did not look back and walked with his head held high.

The entire team started to move silently, like ghosts in the night.

The night was their best disguise.

When they lowered their heads and closed their eyes, their entire bodies would be hidden in the darkness, as if they had completely disappeared.

Two kilometers.

One kilometer.

Five hundred meters.

Balo lowered his head and closed his eyes, clearly smelling the scent of the other party's pride.

The lions behind him all lowered their heads, closed their eyes, and quietly walked.

The entire pride seemed to have suddenly disappeared from the grassland.

Three hundred meters.

Two hundred meters.

80 meters.

Balo suddenly raised his head and looked at the pride opposite him.

The pride opposite seemed to be unguarded. Pairs of dark eyes swayed everywhere and figures paced around.

A good opportunity\!

"Roar—"

Just as Balo raised his head and was about to roar and charge, a roar suddenly sounded from behind the team a few seconds ahead of him.

Then, roars came one after another\!

Balo suddenly turned around and looked over in shock.

The lions behind him also suddenly opened their eyes and turned to look.

A group of enemies of unknown origins were crazily slaughtering the female lions and young cubs at the back\!

The female lions and young cubs following at the back were in chaos. They fled in all directions and roared in fear. Many female lions brought their young cubs and rushed towards their neat formation to seek protection.

"Roar—"

Suddenly, the teams that looked unguarded just now suddenly roared in unison.

However, the other party did not rush up and only roared angrily, as if he was deliberately scaring the terrified female lions and young cubs behind them.

The lion army behind Balo was instantly confused by their female lions and young cubs.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and charged around, slaughtering crazily. He deliberately chased the panicked female lions and young cubs towards the lion army in front.

The husbands or fathers of these female lions and young cubs were in the lion army. Seeing this scene, they did not dare to hesitate. Before Balo could give the order, they roared and pounced back.

The entire black lion army was in chaos. They ran everywhere and roared endlessly.

Balo did not immediately turn around to save them. Instead, he made a prompt decision and immediately roared angrily, charging towards the team in front with the lion army behind him.

He knew clearly that if he brought the army back to save them, the enemy army in front of him would definitely rush over immediately. At that time, they would completely fail\!

"Roar—"

He roared and rushed towards the army opposite.

The tank One-eyed gathered all the strong lions and did not attack. Instead, he still stood in place and waited solemnly.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, Balo had just rushed over twenty meters away from the other party with the lion army when the ground suddenly collapsed\!

Grass flew and soil splashed\!

A long pit suddenly appeared\!

Balo was shocked. Before he could fall into the pit, he kicked the head of a lion behind him and actually jumped up with a whoosh.

However, the other lions behind him were not so lucky. They fell into the pit and were badly mutilated by the sharp wooden stakes at the bottom of the pit\!

This pit was not too deep. When the lions behind saw this scene, they easily jumped over.

Balo stood on the pit, shocked and furious. He immediately roared and led the lion army to continue charging forward with a ferocious and violent expression.

"Boom\!"

Unexpectedly, just as they rushed to a place only ten meters away from the other party, the ground collapsed again\!

Another deep pit suddenly appeared\!

Balo stepped on the head of a lion again and jumped up.

As for the lion, it quickly landed and with a whoosh, its entire head was pierced by a sharp wooden stake\!

The other lions behind him were caught off guard and fell into the pit, blood splashing\!

Balo was terrified. He looked up and saw that the pride opposite was still standing in place without moving. They looked at them coldly, as if they were mocking them.

He was only ten meters away from the other party\!

Would there be more pits ahead?

With his strength, he could jump over directly, but what about landing?

What if he jumped over and landed on the ground full of holes?

"Roar—"

The roars of other lions suddenly sounded from behind.

Balo looked back. The enemies that had appeared at the back had already chased after the lionesses and young cubs and started to kill his lion army.

The lions behind him seemed to be frightened by the tragic deaths of their companions in the pits and pits. They did not dare to move forward and actually turned around to pounce on the small wave of enemies.

Balo roared and stopped them, letting them continue forward. However, the effect was minimal. Only dozens of lions followed behind him loyally.

The enemy team in front of him was vast, dense, and endless\!

With just the few of them, no matter how brave and powerful they were, what could they do?

Balo was furious and desperate, but he had no choice but to turn around. He roared and pounced hatefully at the small group of enemies behind him\!

If he did not pull out this sword that pierced through his body, his team would slowly bleed to death\!

"Roar—"

He was furious and roared like thunder\!

However, just as he turned around with the team, One-eyed and Lars in front immediately rushed up with more than seven hundred members in a majestic manner\!

There were no more pits on the ground.

However, clearly, this black-haired lion king and the lions behind him were already afraid of being cheated.

He would rather turn around than advance.
