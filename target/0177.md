Chapter 177: Little White Lion

"???"

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground and looked at them with his eyes wide open. His mind was filled with questions.

These two idiots actually survived and returned alive. Congratulations. However, what were they doing now?

The Chino brothers dug and felt that the pit was too difficult to dig. When they finished digging, the corpse of their young king would probably have rotted long ago.

Anyway, there were mud pits everywhere. Why not drag their young king into the mud pits and bury him with soil?

The two brothers looked at each other and felt that this method was feasible.

Anyway, their king was dead. It did not matter how he was buried. It was enough to express their loyalty.

There was a mud pit beside them.

The two brothers immediately walked to Chu Xiaoye's side with sorrowful expressions. One in front of the other, Big Chino prepared to bite his neck, and Little Chino prepared to bite his tail.

However, before they could bite, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and slapped them twice\!

Bastard\! They actually wanted to bury him alive\!

The Chino brothers were slapped to the ground. Their eyes were wide open and the urine under their legs shot out with a whoosh. They let out terrified roars\!

"It's a lion trap\!"

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws and slapped them twice. Then, he turned around and walked in front of the mud pit. He raised his head and looked at them coldly.

The Chino brothers trembled and their urine flowed out. They could not stop and their eyes widened as if they had seen a ghost.

Their king was actually not dead\!

So many members of that super pride had died, but they had yet to kill their young king\!

Their king had actually won\!

This was unbelievable\!

Then, they immediately became extremely excited\!

In other words, from today onwards, this territory would truly belong to them\!

However…

Last night, the two brothers had fled before the battle and were now preparing to do a disgraceful and stupid thing. Would this young and powerful king still want them?

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of the mud pit and roared at them to go over.

The Chino brothers immediately stood up and walked over uneasily.

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye waved his claws and slapped them into the mud pit. He stared at them coldly and told them to take a good bath in there. Without his orders, they were not to come up\!

The two brothers shivered as they soaked in the mud and did not dare to move.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left.

He found a waterhole filled with clear water and jumped down, washing the blood on his body.

Rustling sounds came from the bushes.

Many carnivores followed the smell of blood and touched in, starting to wolf down the food.

The sharp eyes of the vulture that was circling in the sky followed a group of wild dogs into the bushes and immediately landed. Then, it let out the noise of calling for its friends.

Soon, groups of vultures came after hearing the news.

Chu Xiaoye soaked in the water and did not disturb them.

These free cleaners would not miss any spot, not even bones.

Every territory needed them.

At noon.

He brought the Chino brothers covered in mud and continued to mark the territory.

Although the Chino brothers had just peed their pants, they were still full of energy and excitement. They had surprisingly much urine.

If it was said that when marking the territory yesterday, he was terrified, guilty, and nervous, then today, he was pleased with himself and felt at ease.

Because their king had completely defeated the lion king.

And this territory's current sovereignty completely belonged to them\!

The two brothers were even more respectful and respectful to Chu Xiaoye. Even if Chu Xiaoye asked them to eat feces now, they would not hesitate and would even show that they liked it very much\!

Chu Xiaoye did not want to smell their urine and could not be bothered to see their wretched appearance when peeing. He turned around and walked towards the river.

The river that ran through the grassland was winding and came from the distant mountain range, flowing towards the ocean at the end of the grassland. In this place with abundant rain, it had never experienced the taste of drying up.

The animals that lived here never knew what thirst was.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the river and looked at the clear and overflowing river water under his feet. He thought of the river at the other side of the mountain, at the foot of the hill where the pride of the cold father was stationed.

The river had long dried up and cracked. On both sides of the river bank and in the riverbed, the corpses of animals that had died from thirst were piled up.

Thinking about it, it was a little ironic.

However, he could blame fate if he came from a poor family, but if he did not live well, he could only blame himself.

Those who were at ease with the situation and did not dare to work hard or fight against fate could only accept fate's arrangements and grow old.

If he wanted to live a better life, he had to be brave and fight against fate. He had to rely on his own effort to fight for a world that belonged to him.

He finally had a world of his own.

However, this was not enough.

He had to let his neighbors, competitors nearby, and even the other factions on the grassland know how powerful he was and not dare to invade his territory.

Otherwise, even if he went back and brought his mother and the others here, he could not guarantee that they could survive here.

The competitors here were too strong.

The jackal couple was dead, and so was Doya. He did not want to rashly bring his mother and the others over and harm them.

Although he had his own territory now, he knew very well that he had yet to stabilize himself on this grassland. He was still unknown, inexperienced, and small. No one would take him seriously.

Those invisible forces would appear at any time and trample his territory and his companions with their strong iron hooves.

Therefore, he had to be like the sun on this grassland, dazzling and making them revere him\!

His dream was to be the king of the grassland, not this mere king of bushes\!

He wondered how Little Curly Tail and the others were doing now.

The two Baobab trees were filled with water. At least they would not be thirsty.

However, food was definitely a problem.

Maya had children that needed to be fed, and it would probably be even more difficult.

However, with Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine's help, they should be fine.

What he needed to worry about now was not them, but himself.

"Bang\!"

Just as he was looking at the river under his feet and thinking about something, a white figure suddenly jumped out from the grass behind him and suddenly hit his butt\!

Chu Xiaoye was caught off guard and fell into the river with a splash.

The river was rapid, but it was not difficult for him.

He quickly surfaced and looked towards the shore, but he did not see anything.

However, not far away, two strong rhinoceroses were standing there and looking at him warily.

His heart skipped a beat as he came to a realization.

Who else could it be?

It must be that little white lion\!

It seemed that he was attacked when he was peeing and pooping previously because of that bastard\!

Just as he was about to swim ashore and settle scores with the little white lion, the water behind him suddenly surged\!

The water that was flowing downstream actually surged towards him.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly turned around and jumped into the middle of the river\!

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere\!

A bloody mouth full of fangs suddenly jumped out of the water from where he had just floated. Two rows of sharp fangs closed with a crack, but they bit empty air\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart immediately turned cold and he hurriedly swam towards the shore\!

It was a green crocodile about three meters long\!

Due to the rapid river, he did not swim fast. As for the crocodile, it quickly dived into the water and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye knew that it had already come close\!

At this moment, if he continued to swim forward with all his might, he would definitely be bitten and be unable to resist\!

If he floated on the water now, he would not be able to see the other party. It would be even more dangerous\!

Therefore, he immediately made a prompt decision and sank\!

The crocodile had already quickly swum in front of him\!

Its bulging eyes flickered with a cold light in the water. It swung its tail and opened its mouth. With a whoosh, it jumped towards him\!

Chu Xiaoye's speed and strength on land were completely useless in the water.

Seeing that the underwater killer was rushing over, he could only quickly sink down. When the bloody mouth was about to approach his head, he suddenly raised his head and fell backward\!

At the same time, his claws suddenly pierced upwards into the crocodile's lower jaw just as it was about to cross him. His two claws behind also grabbed the crocodile's body tightly\!

His entire body was stuck under the crocodile\!

Due to the strong momentum, the crocodile brought him forward for a distance before stopping\!

"Whoosh\!"

The crocodile opened its mouth and started to roll violently in the water, wanting to throw him down from its abdomen\!

Chu Xiaoye's claws pierced deeply into its flesh. For a moment, he could not use much strength. He was dizzy from rolling and swayed\!

Seeing that he was about to be thrown out, he immediately closed his eyes, opened his mouth, and bit the crocodile's left front leg\!

At this moment, he could finally use his teeth to fix his body onto the crocodile. His sharp claws slashed down from its jaw like sharp blades and instantly cut open its body\!

The river water churned and blood surged\!

The little white lion stood on the shore and watched this scene with its eyes wide open.

She only wanted to take revenge and teach this kid a lesson. Who would have thought that this kid would be so unlucky to encounter a crocodile just as he fell into the water?

At this moment, he was probably already torn to pieces by the crocodiles.

Hmph\! He deserved it\!

He had offended her\!

Just as she turned around and was about to leave, the river water suddenly splashed with a whoosh\!

Then, a figure jumped up from the water. With a bang, he sat on her head and smashed her to the ground, burying her mouth and face in the mud\!

"Pfft—"

A black smoke suddenly sprayed out from under the butt that was pressing against her head. Like a hairdryer, it blew her middle and then instantly covered her entire body\!

The two rhinoceroses not far away hurriedly rushed over.
