Chapter 400: Untitled

Did you see my little bear?

When Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw the little girl following behind the team sitting on the back of the big black bear with a bright smile, he could not help but think of this line.

If the black bear was changed to a brown bear and the antelope skin on the little girl was changed to a little red dress, it would be even more interesting.

The majestic black bear king suddenly became the mount of a human little girl, but he no longer had any temper. Instead, he enjoyed it and was rather happy.

The little girl grabbed its fur, moved her legs, and sang.

It narrowed its eyes with a look of enjoyment and listened happily. Occasionally, it would roar a few times, creating a harmonious, warm, and intimate scene.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team down the roadless mountain path.

Before the sky turned dark, they came to an orchard.

The fruit tree was full of golden fruits that bent the branches.

Chu Xiaoye looked carefully and realized that these fruits were rather familiar, like persimmons he had eaten before.

A group of monkeys jumped around the tree and ate non-stop. When they saw the pride arrive, they immediately squeaked and dispersed.

The few birds were not afraid at all and continued to peck on the tree. Occasionally, fruits would fall from the tree and fall to the grass, but they were intact.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of a fruit and extended his claws to pluck it. He lowered his head to smell it. It was really the smell of persimmons, but it seemed to be even more fragrant than the persimmons he had eaten before.

They did not travel when the sky turned dark.

Chu Xiaoye instructed the pride to stop and rest for the night.

The big black bear lay on the ground and spread its limbs as much as possible. It lay at the lowest point so that the little girl could get down from his back.

The little girl hugged its neck and slid down its back. She happily picked up a fruit on the ground, peeled it, and placed it under her nose to smell. She had a surprised expression.

She had never eaten such fruit, but it seemed to smell good.

Just as she brought the fruit to her mouth and was about to eat it, the black bear beside her suddenly extended its claws and slapped her small hand. The fruit fell to the ground with a bang.

At the same time, a colorful poisonous worm that looked like a centipede crawled out of the fruit and quickly slipped away.

The little girl was so frightened that her face turned pale and she no longer had the mood to eat.

The big black bear used its claws to fiddle with another fruit on the ground and pushed it in front of the little girl. It let out a whimper and gestured for her to eat.

The little girl shook her head with a lingering fear.

The big black bear lowered its head and bit the fruit into its mouth. It chewed a few times and swallowed it all at once with a look of enjoyment.

It seemed that the fruit tasted quite good.

Chu Xiaoye used his claws to cut open one and examined it carefully. Then, he lowered his head and ate half. It was sweet and fragrant, and the juice was rich. It was very good.

When Little Curly Tail saw this, he thought that it was something good. He hurriedly picked up one from the ground and bit it to pieces. In the end, he vomited it all out with a retch.

He was not used to eating such sweet things.

The other members of the pride did not dare to be interested in this food.

Other than the leopard family, the three warthogs, and the cold father who was used to eating sweet and sour fruits.

The cold father tried to eat one and felt that it was not bad. He ate three more in a row and even went over to share his opinion of this fruit with the Belita sisters.

Unfortunately, the two sisters ignored him.

The other members of the pride lay down to rest.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers took the initiative to patrol the surroundings.

The energetic and idle Little Curly Tail also forcefully called Molly away and brought her around. When they reached a place Chu Xiaoye could not see, Little Curly Tail immediately started to beat Molly excitedly, venting his anger from wanting to fight the Black Bear King previously, but not fighting.

At first, Molly tried her best to resist. In the end, seeing that resistance was useless, she immediately lay on the ground, curled her head, and did not move, letting him bully her.

Seeing that she was so useless, Little Curly Tail immediately jumped onto her back and grabbed and bit her head, neck, and ears. He fiercely ordered her to get up and continue fighting.

Molly buried her head in the grass and let the wind and rain hit her, but she did not move.

For some reason, this female cub suddenly thought of the scene she had seen previously. The cold father had pressed Maya down and lowered her, just like Little Curly Tail was pressing her down now…

Although they were all bullies, it seemed to be different.

"Squeak\! Squeak\!"

Chu Xiaoye was eating this fruit under the tree and reminiscing the taste of the past when the cries of the monkeys suddenly sounded above him.

The monkeys returned and their numbers increased.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and was not sure of the species of these monkeys. However, these fellows were small and could not pose a threat to the pride.

"Squeak\! Squeak\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to ignore them, these monkeys suddenly started to scream angrily at the pride. Some screamed while shaking branches, and some even threw fruits with all their strength.

"Bam\!"

The female lions were hit in the head by the fruits and immediately roared angrily, looking up angrily.

Those monkeys cried and jumped, grinning and squinting, as if they were mocking and gloating.

"Roar\!"

The little girl was also hit in the head. The big black bear beside her immediately stood up and roared at the tree. It was deafening and bared its fangs, looking fierce\!

The monkeys on the tree were shocked. Just as they were about to flee, a monkey suddenly threw down another fruit and slapped the big black bear's head.

"Roar\!"

The big black bear was furious. It continued to roar, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, looking murderous.

However, the monkey grinned and threw another fruit at its face.

The big black bear was so angry that it jumped and roared, but it did not do anything.

Now, the monkeys understood that although this stupid big fellow looked powerful, he could not do anything to them\!

The reason why they dared to return and dared to bully these lions without restraint was because they knew that these fellows could only roar ferociously under the tree and could not climb up the tree at all. They could not threaten them at all.

"Squeak\! Squeak\!"

The monkeys continued to scream and jump. They plucked the fruits and threw them down, striking the big black bear's head and the other lions.

For a moment, fruits fell densely like rain.

The pride was shocked and furious. They roared as they dodged.

The monkeys were even more pleased with themselves when they saw this scene. They grinned and hooted, throwing even more happily.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped up from the ground and used the tree trunk as a springboard. With a few leaps, it arrived in front of the two monkeys. Before the two monkeys could react, blood sprayed and their stomachs were broken\!

The two monkeys tilted and fell from the tree, landing heavily on the ground. Their internal organs fell to the ground, but their eyes were already wide open. They were not completely dead and had yet to react to what was happening.

The other monkeys' excited cries immediately stopped. Their actions of throwing fruits instantly froze.

Catherine stood on the tree with blood on her claws and looked at them coldly.

The monkeys were shocked and terrified. Just as they were about to flee in panic, they were terrified to discover that there were also a few lions standing on the trees in other directions at some point in time\!

At the same time, an icy killing intent came from above\!

Looking up, it was their natural enemy—leopards\!
