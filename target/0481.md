Chapter 481: Golden Fur Lion King\!

The spacious cave at the bottom of the tree seemed to be a little crowded in an instant.

The pride that had just bared their fangs and brandished their claws immediately quietened down.

The lions near the second hole retreated into the distance in fear.

Even if this terrifying ancient ferocious beast stood there and looked at them, it could scare them out of their urine.

That powerful and terrifying aura assaulted them like a mountain pressing down, making every lion tremble.

All the lions that rushed in obediently stopped in place and did not move, waiting for its orders. They did not even dare to breathe.

The Jerry brothers, who had been slapped away, struggled to stand up from the ground, their faces covered in blood. Just as they were about to roar and rush up, their feet turned limp and they fell to the ground again.

The saber-toothed tiger did not look at them again.

This terrifying ancient ferocious beast was squinting its eyes and searching every corner of the cave, as if it was looking for something.

The cave was filled with the scent of lions and a strange fragrance.

It did not discover the figure.

It seemed to be a little disappointed but also relieved.

At this moment, its cold and bloodthirsty tiger eyes looked at the pride gathered under the tree root.

It strode over with its thick limbs.

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs and his tail was almost straightened. His body was trembling.

The cold father and the female lions were not much better. Under the suppression of this ancient ferocious beast's terrifying aura, they were almost defeated and did not even have the courage to resist.

They could not help but tremble, and even their roars became hoarse and powerless.

This was a battle without any suspense.

The saber-toothed tiger walked over and raised its huge and thick iron claw.

There was no doubt that when the iron claw slapped a lion's head or face, it would cause tons of damage.

Even the hard ground could not resist it, let alone a body of flesh and blood.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly rushed out of the dark corner and pounced at the saber-toothed tiger at lightning speed.

"Bang\!"

The saber-toothed tiger did not even look back. With a swing of its tail, it sent the attacker flying.

It turned out that it had long discovered this attacker.

It turned its head and looked at her coldly and disdainfully.

Alisa fell to the ground in a sorry state and immediately jumped up.

The other lions beside him did not take the opportunity to rush up together, because now was not the time for them to perform. They did not dare to perform casually.

Actually, like these lions hiding in the cave, they were also terrified in front of this terrifying ferocious beast.

"Roar—"

When the saber-toothed tiger turned its head, Little Curly Tail suddenly pounced forward. The straightened tail behind him also swung out like an iron whip\!

He was very fast.

However, this saber-toothed tiger's reaction speed was also very fast.

The saber-toothed tiger opened its bloody mouth and bit\!

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly swung his tail and wrapped it around the thick root at the back, causing his charging body to immediately stop and fly up\!

He seemed to want to fly over the head of this saber-toothed tiger.

However, he had underestimated the strength of this ancient ferocious beast.

The saber-toothed tiger suddenly stood up and swung its huge claws. With a bang, it slapped his head.

Little Curly Tail flew out and fell heavily to the ground. His head was covered in blood and his vision was black. Just as he struggled to stand up, he fell to the ground again.

Although this attack did not kill him immediately, it also injured him terrifyingly.

With just one claw, he could not stand up.

The saber-toothed tiger did not look at him again and walked towards Mei Mei, who was baring her teeth and trembling.

"Tibbs\! Fight\!"

Right at this moment, the human girl's voice suddenly came from the tree hole above him.

Hearing this crisp and strange sound, the saber-toothed tiger was clearly stunned. Then, it stopped in its tracks and raised its head to look up. A trace of bewilderment suddenly appeared in its bloodthirsty tiger eyes, as if it had heard this sound before.

"Roar—"

The trembling big black bear suddenly roared and rushed over.

The saber-toothed tiger finally felt threatened. It immediately turned around and faced the equally huge and fierce black bear.

The big black bear swung its palm, but it was dodged by the saber-toothed tiger. The saber-toothed tiger's slap landed heavily on its face.

The big black bear's heavy body collapsed like a small mountain and fell to the ground.

However, it quickly stood up.

It roared angrily again and pounced over.

"Bang\!"

Hence, it was slapped to the ground again.

The big black bear's mouth was filled with blood, but it was still fearless. It stood up again.

It bared its fangs and charged over fearlessly.

Then, it was slapped to the ground for the third time.

This time, the saber-toothed tiger was clearly weaker and started to pant heavily.

The big black bear lay on the ground, its face covered in blood and its head dizzy.

At this moment, the childish and sweet voice of a little girl came from above again, but it was filled with orders. "Tibbs\! Get up\! Continue fighting\!"

Hence, the big black bear stood up again.

This time, the big black bear's body suddenly expanded. The fur on its entire body stood up and its face became even more ferocious. The fangs in its mouth extended from the corner of its mouth and became long and sharp. Its eyes also turned terrifying scarlet\!

"Roar—"

It suddenly let out a deafening roar and rushed up again.

"Bang\!"

This time, its huge claws collided with the saber-toothed tiger's claws.

Both sides trembled and took a few steps back.

The saber-toothed tiger's gaze immediately turned grave.

When the big black bear rushed up again, the saber-toothed tiger did not face it head-on. Instead, it agilely jumped away to dodge and started to drain the big black bear's strength.

Although the big black bear had become stronger, its intelligence did not seem to have increased much. It still roared and chased after him.

The saber-toothed tiger continued to dodge and expend its energy.

"Bang\!"

Finally, the saber-toothed tiger attacked and slapped the big black bear heavily on the head again.

The big black bear fell to the ground and could not get up for a moment.

Killing intent appeared in the saber-toothed tiger's eyes. It suddenly jumped over and slapped the big black bear's head ruthlessly with its huge claws.

The big black bear's entire head suddenly split open like a watermelon, and blood splashed everywhere.

The big black bear that was struggling immediately froze and did not move.

The saber-toothed tiger stood in place, its stomach heaving violently and its mouth panting. Its claws that were fighting the big black bear were trembling slightly.

It suddenly raised its head and looked up.

It did not see the human girl's figure and only saw a pair of dark and cold eyes.

Catherine finally moved.

She took a few steps forward and stood in front of the tree hole, looking down.

The saber-toothed tiger looked at her for a few seconds, then suddenly ran two steps and jumped up.

It jumped very high and suddenly slapped with its huge claws.

Catherine also jumped up and passed under its huge claws. With a silver flash, her sharp claws pierced through its fur from its abdomen.

However, before she could continue to stab into the flesh, the saber-toothed tiger's counterattack had already arrived\!

The saber-toothed tiger's hind claws actually pierced into her body and sent her flying.

Catherine flew towards the other tree hole and fell heavily to the ground. However, she quickly rolled to reduce the force and jumped up again.

She was like an agile leopard cat, jumping agilely in the tree hole at an extremely fast speed. When the saber-toothed tiger landed, she returned to the tree hole and guarded it, as if she had never left.

Her back was already blurry.

The saber-toothed tiger's breathing became even heavier and its eyes started to turn red.

This terrifying ancient ferocious beast finally started to get angry.

The surrounding lions were silent. They all retreated to a corner and did not dare to move.

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly came from the first hole.

His head was covered in blood and half of his head had already collapsed. He actually obtained his will and strength from somewhere and walked back step by step.

He fell in from the collapsed entrance and struggled to get up. He wanted to pounce on a lion in front of him, but he staggered and fell to the ground again.

The lion looked at him with a complicated gaze and did not take the opportunity to attack.

The saber-toothed tiger turned around and looked. Its eyelids twitched a few times. Then, it turned around and walked straight towards him.

Its life force was tenacious and it was not afraid of death. Its blue eyes that were loyal to the pride seemed to have aroused some anger in this ancient ferocious beast.

The saber-toothed tiger decided to tear him apart first\!

Blue Eyes struggled to stand up from the ground, his face covered in blood. He bared his fangs and looked fearlessly at this ferocious beast that was many times larger than him. He let out an unyielding roar\!

The saber-toothed tiger bared its sharp claws and walked over step by step.

Suddenly, the human girl's voice came from above again. "Tibbs\! Get up\! I'm coming down\!"

The saber-toothed tiger suddenly turned around\!

The big black bear with a broken head actually trembled and suddenly got up from the ground. At the same time, its broken head recovered at a visible speed\!

No one saw a strange energy float out of the tree hole like the wind and enter the big black bear's head.

The big black bear swayed its head a few times and walked under the tree hole as if it had never been injured.

The little girl walked out of the tree hole in a white dress. She reached out and rubbed Catherine's head, then jumped down. Her golden hair fluttered and her skirt fluttered. She had a strange fragrance, like a little fairy that had landed in the mortal world from the immortal world. She landed lightly on the big black bear's back.

Catherine looked at her in a daze. Then, she suddenly turned around and looked at the hole.

Little Curly Tail, the cold father, Mei Mei, the Jerry brothers, the leopard family of four, and Blue Eyes and so on suddenly raised their heads and looked at the tree hole, their hearts beating rapidly.

The saber-toothed tiger also looked over, as if it suddenly had a premonition. Its eyelids started to twitch.

The other lions around also looked over, but they were confused, not knowing what was happening.

Chu Xiaoye walked out.

As if he had been reborn, inch-long golden fur grew on his once bare body. Although it was very short, his entire body was golden and even more beautiful\!

He believed that before long, he would have a golden fur that was even more dense and domineering\!

He passed by Catherine and turned to look at her. He suddenly stopped and leaned close to her as if his heart ached. He rubbed her body and his gaze was gentle and touched.

"Girl, thank you."

Catherine's dark and cold eyes were suddenly filled with tears. They were watery, clear, and moving, trembling slightly.

She opened her mouth and could not help but lean towards him. She wanted to continue being rubbed gently by him, but Chu Xiaoye had already walked away.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped down and his golden claws lit up\!

"Roar—"

The saber-toothed tiger suddenly roared and ordered the surrounding prides to attack immediately\!

Blue Eyes suddenly used its last bit of strength and pounced from behind, biting its hind leg\!

The saber-toothed tiger placed all its attention on Chu Xiaoye, who was pouncing over from above. It was caught off guard. When he felt intense pain, he no longer had the time to care about what was behind him.

He endured the pain and raised his upper body, his huge claws facing the sharp golden claw\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

His huge claws left his body and flew out.

"Roar—"

A miserable and terrifying roar terrified the surrounding lions.

Little Curly Tail's tail jumped over like a venomous snake and wrapped around his front leg. He suddenly pulled and this huge creature that was still letting out a miserable scream fell to the ground with a bang.

Before it could roar and jump up, Chu Xiaoye's sharp golden claw had already pierced into its neck with a "chi"\!

At the same time, Catherine had jumped over at some point in time and pierced her sharp silver claws into its abdomen\!

The golden claw and silver claw exerted strength together and cut the ancient ferocious beast's neck and stomach\!

An even more terrifying scream came from the saber-toothed tiger's mouth\!

It suddenly broke free of all the restraints and jumped up from the ground. Its head hit the ceiling above heavily. Then, with the blood that sprayed out and the fallen internal organs, it fell down and fell heavily to the ground. It twitched violently a few times before dying completely.

It widened its eyes, its tail straightened, and all the hair on its body stood on end, as if it was unwilling.

Chu Xiaoye's claws pierced into its neck again and cut off its entire head.

Just as this huge tiger head was about to leave its body, Chu Xiaoye's golden claw that was soaked in the blood of this ancient ferocious beast suddenly lit up with a strange light.

No one saw it, including him.

However, a human's painful and desperate voice suddenly came from his mind. "No\! No—"

Then, this ancient ferocious beast that had already died suddenly trembled. A circular light spot crawled out from between its brows and fluttered away like a firefly. Soon, it flew out of the cave and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye froze in place and watched this scene in a daze. He suddenly thought of something that had happened in his dream when he fell asleep during this period of time.

Obviously, more things that subverted his worldview and the entire world were happening one by one.

The blood of the saber-toothed tiger seemed to be filled with a special energy that was flowing into his body through his claws.

It was not some skill he had imagined.

The death of the saber-toothed tiger put an end to this battle and encirclement.

The pride surrounding him turned around and fled without hesitation.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and looked at the two lions.

Two lion kings died, and two more were left.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine rushed out.

The female cub understood him as always.

Alisa, Little Curly Tail, Molly, and the four leopards followed.

Some hatred could be let go, but some hatred had to be taken.

This was a counterattack massacre\!
