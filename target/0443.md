Chapter 443: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

A feather flew down\!

Catherine's silver claws did not leave any wounds on the moa.

However, this sneak attack angered this ancient ferocious bird\!

The moa suddenly turned around, lowered its head, and pecked fiercely at Catherine\!

As soon as Catherine landed, she jumped up and fled into the distance.

The moa was flustered and exasperated. It opened its two thick and strong legs and started to chase.

At this moment, the battlefield on the other side was already approaching its end.

Under the lead of Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur, the members of the pride, including the leopard family of four and the cute violent bear mother and son, fought bravely\!

The six lions were no match for them at all. In a moment, three died, and the remaining three were seriously injured. They immediately fled in panic with the female lions.

In order to let them leave the moa completely, Blue Eyes brought the pride and continued to chase them, chasing them out of the territory and into the distant night.

On Chu Xiaoye's side, the furious moa had long lost its mind after being provoked by them one by one. It rushed around to chase after them, but they agilely dodged them.

After an hour, the moa started to slow down and its pecking movements also started to slow down.

It was already tired.

This was the effect Chu Xiaoye wanted.

However, the current moas were still very terrifying. If they were not careful, their skulls would shatter or their large arteries would shatter.

Therefore, he had to continue walking the bird\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and suddenly grabbed at the moa's thigh, tearing off a few more pieces of leather armor.

This time, he finally left a few bloody marks on the thick thigh.

The moa was furious and immediately turned around to peck\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and continued to run forward.

When the moa was about to catch up to him with its huge body and strong legs, Catherine attacked from the side and Mei Mei attacked from behind. The moa could only turn around and chase after them.

After another half an hour, this ferocious moa's running speed and pecking movements became even slower.

It did not even have the strength to run anymore.

It was already exhausted.

At this moment, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others also returned with the pride.

When the moa saw this, it knew that its life might be in danger if it continued to pester. It immediately raised its feet and strode towards the river not far away, preparing to cross the river and escape.

However, the pride had already seen its fatigue and immediately started attacking.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and jumped onto its back. His sharp golden claws pierced through its fur and flesh with a whoosh\!

The moa felt the pain and immediately cried out angrily. It turned its head and prepared to peck.

However, right at this moment, two figures suddenly flew up from left and right. Alisa's claws grabbed its most fragile neck, and Catherine's claws grabbed its abdomen\!

Mei Mei and Molly pounced at its two legs that could not run anymore\!

Alisa and Catherine's attacks were the most fatal.

The moa was shocked. It immediately put away its beak that was pecking at Chu Xiaoye and pecked at the flying Alisa. At the same time, it used all its strength to open its two strong legs\!

"Bang\!"

Mei Mei and Molly, who had just pounced on its thighs and were about to bite, were sent flying.

Molly was just sent flying in front of her and fell heavily to the ground. Just as she was about to be trampled to death by the moa, Little Curly Tail suddenly rushed out from the side. His tail flew out with a whoosh and wrapped tightly around the moa's legs.

This time, because the moa was already exhausted, had no strength, and did not run, Little Curly Tail's hard tail immediately restrained its moving feet.

Due to the inertia of its forward motion, the moa was tripped by the tail and suddenly fell forward. Then, with a bang, it fell heavily to the ground and almost pressed on Molly.

Molly fled for her life. She ignored the pain in her entire body and quickly jumped up from the ground. However, she did not escape immediately. Furthermore, she pounced on the moa's head and bit its head\!

The moa immediately let out an angry roar. It hurriedly swayed its head and struggled to stand up.

At this moment, all the members of the pride quickly pounced forward and landed on it. They opened their fangs and bit all the flesh on its body\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his golden claw and suddenly pierced its neck\!

Catherine's sharp silver claws pierced through the moa's abdomen and she started to open its stomach skillfully\!

Alisa's sharp claws also landed on the moa's neck\!

Mei Mei and the sisters also pounced forward and hung on the moa's neck, biting it tightly\!

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others pressed against the moa's thigh. Their sharp fangs pierced through its leather armor and into the muscles inside\!

The leopard family of four also jumped onto the moa and bit it.

The cute violent bear and her son actually started to learn from the spotted hyenas and fought ferociously behind the moa.

The big black bear saw that this terrifying moa was pressed to the ground by the pride and could not move. It immediately rushed over with the little girl on its back and jumped onto the moa. It opened its mouth and bit the moa's wings that were about to degenerate.

The huge moa was in extreme pain and let out a miserable scream. It struggled with all its might, wanting to stand up.

Catherine's silver claw broke open its stomach\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw tore off half of its neck\!

He originally thought that this moa had completely no strength to resist. Unexpectedly, right at this moment, this terrifying ancient ferocious bird suddenly used its last bit of strength to stand up from the ground\!

Lions were hanging all over its body. Those sharp fangs pierced into its body\!

Its stomach was broken and blood splashed. Its intestines were dragged all over the ground and its internal organs fell\!

The neck and head full of lions hanging on them hung down and could not be raised.

However, it still strode forward with its two strong legs and took a few steps forward with difficulty. It let out a terrifying roar. Then, it froze in place and tilted its body. With a bang, it fell to the ground and died completely\!

Chu Xiaoye and the members of the pride were shocked by the ferocity and tenacious life force of this ancient ferocious bird. They still bit its flesh tightly and did not dare to relax.

After a long time, until the terrified moa stopped moving, Chu Xiaoye let go of his teeth and looked up at the huge creature in front of him with lingering fear.

The combined strength of all the members of the pride was required to kill this moa. From this, it could be seen how terrifying this thing was\!

The moa widened its eyes. Its flesh was blurry and its death was extremely miserable. It looked like it died with a grievance.

The flesh was still hot.

Chu Xiaoye did not waste such good food and immediately instructed everyone to start eating.

Suddenly, the three seriously injured lions returned with the ten-over female lions.
