Chapter 349: Untitled

The rain continued to fall.

As for the atmosphere, it was still harmonious.

At dawn, the rain still did not stop.

The temperature fell and the forest was exceptionally cold.

The flames burned for the entire night, but in the end, they could not resist the might of nature and gradually extinguished.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground, looking at the rain in sorrow.

The little girl snuggled beside him and fell asleep unconsciously.

Her clothes were not dry and her hair was still dripping with rain.

Due to the cold, the little girl curled up into a ball while sleeping and her lips turned a little dark.

Obviously, her young and fragile body could not resist the invasion of the rain in the end and she caught a cold and had a fever.

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws, as if he wanted to touch her forehead. He woke up again. He was not human. What was a claw touching her forehead?

Was there a need to touch such an obvious fever?

There should be many herbs in the forest, but he did not know them.

Even if he knew them, he could only sigh at the medicine.

At dawn, the little girl trembled as she frowned and muttered in her sleep, as if she was having a nightmare.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and called the warthog Pit over, letting it dig a hole on the hill. He quickly walked towards the distant forest.

Soon, he returned with a bloody fur in his mouth and roasted it on the fire that was still warm from the sparks.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Tilly, and the others lay at the side and watched quietly, not knowing what he was going to do.

The heavy rain turned into a light rain, but it was endless and there was no end to it.

The mountain path was muddy and slippery, steep and dangerous.

This was not a good time to travel. If they slipped and fell down the hill, the gains would not make up for the losses.

Pit was very fast and the cave on the hill was dug out very quickly.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he also roasted the fur that he had peeled from monkeys or gorillas and wrapped it around the little girl.

The little girl opened her eyes and looked at him in a daze. She did not speak or move. Clearly, she was unconscious from the fever and felt weak all over.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Little Curly Tail, asking him to come and help.

Little Curly Tail finally obtained his brother's recognition and request for help. He immediately jumped over happily. With a sweep of his tail, he rolled the little girl and the blanket up and carried them on his back.

The little girl was tightly wrapped in fur and her neck was tightly strangled by Little Curly Tail's tail. She was almost suffocated and her face was red.

Chu Xiaoye slapped Little Curly Tail's head to make him pay more attention.

Little Curly Tail hurriedly let go a little. He carried the little girl and quickly walked into the newly dug cave. Then, he swung his tail and threw the little girl to the ground.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him again, causing his eyes to water.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and spread the fur on the ground with his claws. Then, he placed the little girl on it and wrapped her tightly with the fur.

The little girl seemed to have woken up a little. She looked at him pitifully with her sleepy eyes.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment, raised his claws, and spread her golden hair outside the fur. Then, he used his claws to push her clothes.

The little girl soon understood.

If she slept in her rain-soaked dress, she would never recover.

Her head was dizzy and she did not have any strength in her body, but she still struggled. She wrapped herself with the warm fur and untied her skirt with difficulty.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left. He walked in front of the bonfire and hesitated for a while before bringing over some dry leaves and branches that were not wet by the rain from the dense bushes around him. He carefully piled them on the fire that had yet to be completely extinguished.

Soon, smoke rose from under the fire.

Little Curly Tail, who was watching curiously at the side, immediately widened his eyes when he saw this scene. His face was filled with excitement, as if he wanted to go forward and use his claws to move it like his brother. However, he remembered what happened last night and was afraid to do so.

The smoke became thicker.

Soon, the flames started burning again.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the big tree above him and broke some branches, reinforcing the canopy above. Finally, no rain fell into the fire.

At this moment, the little girl had already taken off her moist dress, shoes, and socks and wrapped them tightly in the dry fur. She looked at him with her eyes wide open.

She was a human, so she knew how to make fire. However, why did this lion know how to make fire too? Furthermore, it knew how to make rain shelters and honey beef. She found it unbelievable.

Chu Xiaoye stuck a few branches on the ground beside the fire and returned to the cave. Under the little girl's puzzled gaze, he picked up her dress and returned to the fire. He hung her dress on a branch beside the fire and baked it seriously.

The little girl lay in the cave with her head tilted and was dumbfounded.

The flames burned the withered branches and crackled. The rain in the forest was still dripping.

Time quietly passed.

Soon, Chu Xiaoye baked the little girl's clothes dry and brought them back. Then, he brought her shoes and socks over and hung them on the branch to continue baking.

To be honest, Chu Xiaoye did not know how he could do this.

Although he was once a human, that was in his previous life. Furthermore, he had already saved this human girl's life and allowed her to follow in the team. He had already done his best.

As a lion now, he should be cold and heartless, more vigilant and resistant to humans. However, clearly, he could not do so.

Perhaps, this little girl had yet to become an adult and was still a pure and clear child. She had never done anything evil to animals or the grassland, nor had she ever had any bad intentions.

Perhaps, he had always been as lonely and miserable as this little girl.

Before the little girl came to this team, wasn't he a lion that was like a little girl? He seemed to be surrounded by companions and family, but who could understand his heart?

In the evening, the rain was less heavy.

Blue Eyes and his friends went to the forest not far away to hunt.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly also went to the other side to hunt.

Tilly hid in the dense bushes at the side and slept.

Catherine lay silently beside the fire and watched his every move.

Chu Xiaoye brought the dry shoes and socks back to the cave and placed them beside the little girl.

The little girl was already asleep. Her face was red and her breath was hot. Clearly, she was still having a fever.

Chu Xiaoye leaned close and could almost feel the hot aura on her forehead.

He reached out with his claws and brushed the little girl's beautiful hair. It was already dry, but the disappearing moisture had probably entered her body through her pores.

If she continued to have a fever, her life would definitely be in danger.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and stood at the entrance of the cave. He looked at the dark sky and the endless rain and sighed inwardly.

He had already done everything he could. She could only rely on herself. If she still could not hold on, he could only abandon her or bury her in this cave.

When night was about to fall, the rain in the sky suddenly turned red.

Like blood, it fell drop by drop.

This familiar blood rain made Chu Xiaoye even more worried.

However, looking at the blood rain that caused the animals and plants on the grassland to mutate and grow, Chu Xiaoye's eyes suddenly lit up. He turned around and looked at the little girl in the hole.

Since this blood rain could make many plants grow crazily and allow many animals to evolve and mutate, making them stronger than before, this blood rain definitely contained extremely powerful energy.

What would happen if this human girl drank a few mouthfuls?

Would it immediately eliminate the bacteria in her body, strengthen her body, and heal her illness?

This was an opportunity.

No matter what, he had to try.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of a bush and used his claws to cut off a thick stem. Then, he used the tip of his claws to empty a little space from the middle. Then, he took some rain from the sky and returned to the cave.

The little girl closed her eyes tightly and frowned. Her face and forehead were red from the heat and she twitched occasionally. She looked like it was getting worse.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and used his two claws to hold the stem containing the blood rain. He stuck out his tongue and licked it a few times, letting his saliva mix with the blood rain.

He did not know if he could succeed.

If he failed, he could only silently apologize and bury this little girl.

"Come, drink the medicine."

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and nudged the little girl's head to wake her up.

The little girl opened her eyes in a daze. She did not know where she was, nor did she know who she was, let alone who this mighty and terrifying face in front of her was.

Chu Xiaoye poured the blood mixed with saliva into her mouth.

The little girl subconsciously opened her mouth and drank it. After drinking it, she closed her eyes and fell asleep in a daze.

After the sky turned dark, Blue Eyes and the rest returned with their prey.

Little Curly Tail and the others also returned with a load.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the bonfire and continued to add branches into it. He especially added branches that were wet by the rain. Then, he tore off a deer leg and placed it on it to roast.

No one dared to say anything about his strange actions.

Tilly, who had just gotten close, cried and her snot flowed because of the smoke as she fled in panic.

Little Curly Tail did not dare to approach and ate the meat not far away.

After Chu Xiaoye placed the deer leg on the fire, he left to eat.

As the smoke roasted the deer, the water in the deer's legs quickly evaporated, the blood solidified, the skin turned scorched, and oil flowed everywhere.

After Chu Xiaoye finished eating, he went to the forest to bite some orange jessamine, pepper, and other plants. He returned and continued to burn them on the fire, forcing out the fragrance inside and roasting the deer legs on them.

Soon, fragrance filled the air.

Even the cold father could not help but turn around to look.

Catherine was very smart. After looking at it a few times, she knew how to maintain the flames. Every time the flames gradually subsided, she would find some withered branches and carefully stuff them under the plant spices.

The deer's legs were soon roasted golden. Oil fell into the fire and sizzled.

Chu Xiaoye would not eat these things, nor would he let the other members of the pride eat these things. The current them did not have the qualifications to enjoy these cooked food.

Of course, they were also not used to it.

They needed to replenish water from the raw meat and obtain more energy from the raw meat.

After the deer leg was smoked, Chu Xiaoye bit it and returned to the cave. He placed it beside the little girl and lay there, looking at the blood-colored rain outside and thinking about his future life.

This blood rain came too suddenly and was not the time.

Only after the sky cleared and the ground dried could he continue to lead the team forward.

He hoped that this blood rain did not bring too much shock to this world.
