Chapter 447: Untitled

The black fog finally dispersed.

After waiting for another hour, no more poisonous creatures crawled out of the cave at the bottom of the tree.

Chu Xiaoye walked in carefully, his eyes flickering with a golden light. He observed the situation inside carefully and did not let go of any corner.

The corpses on the ground were all dead because of the stench of the black smoke, or poisoned.

Chu Xiaoye circled inside and saw that there was no danger anymore. He immediately stuck his head out and growled at the outside, calling for everyone to come in and clean the corpses on the ground.

Most of the corpses of these poisonous bugs could not be eaten. Even if they could be eaten, it was also very dangerous.

Therefore, while everyone was busy cleaning the corpses on the ground, Chu Xiaoye stood at the side and supervised the leopard sisters, the cute violent bear mother and son pair solemnly.

Only these few fellows would eat indiscriminately.

As for Brother Flat Top Little Mi, there was no need to worry. It could eat as much as it wanted. It could not finish them even if it stuffed itself to death. Furthermore, it would be fine if it ate them.

Other than cleaning the poisonous corpses on the ground and in the corners of the tree holes, Chu Xiaoye also ordered them to clean up some withered branches and rotten leaves.

Since he wanted to stay here, he naturally had to live comfortably.

The little girl did it especially warmly and busied herself with a happy expression.

From now on, she did not have to wander around anymore.

In this barren mountain with no human footprints, it was so fortunate to be able to have a house that could shelter them from the wind and rain.

Not only were the houses here spacious, they were also divided into many small houses. There were even natural tree holes formed by many old roots above them. They were equivalent to secret rooms in attics. They could stay in whichever one they wanted. They were too happy\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the tree holes above.

Living up there was definitely safer than staying down there.

However, it was not so easy to go up unless one knew how to climb trees.

He, Little Curly Tail, and the others definitely had to live on it. They were already used to sleeping on the tree. They could not sleep on the ground and did not feel safe.

As for the other members, they could only sleep on the ground.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and jumped onto a thick root at the side. He followed the root and quickly climbed up.

There were a total of three tree holes on this root. The space was very wide. Be it his size or that of Blue Eyes, or Mixed Fur, it was more than enough to stay inside.

"Eh?"

Just as he was choosing his residence, he suddenly realized that a tree hole was filled with white bones. From the relatively intact bones, he could tell that they were the bones of some animals. There were monkeys, wild rabbits, black antelopes, and even the skeleton of a leopard.

It seemed that there were carnivores here. That ferocious beast should often hide here to eat.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and roared at the ground. He let Little Curly Tail and the others come up and examine the other tree holes carefully, in case there were other ferocious beasts hiding inside.

Although his smelly farts were powerful, the larger and stronger an animal was, the less obvious the effect would be. Furthermore, there were many mutated animals and poisonous creatures that were immune to poisonous gas. Some would immediately hold their breaths.

Therefore, the black smoke just now could not guarantee that it could eliminate all the animals and poisonous creatures here.

Catherine, Mei Mei, Molly, and Little Curly Tail immediately climbed up and started to check every tree hole.

Alisa walked out and stood at the entrance of the cave. She raised her head and looked at the towering tree king that looked down on all vegetation. She was in a daze, not knowing what she was thinking.

Chu Xiaoye followed the thick tree trunk and continued to climb up, preparing to see how tall this super huge tree was.

However, just as he crawled from the bottom of the tree to the root, before he could continue climbing, he suddenly realized that the old bark filled with creases and vicissitudes was covered in amber mucus. It was like syrup, thick and sticky, and it was all wrapped around his claws. With every step, he had to pull up four long sticky threads. Furthermore, the higher he went, the more exhausting it was and the more difficult it was to raise his feet.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. The bark on it was covered in this thick mucus and covered the entire tree trunk. The higher he went, the thicker it became.

If he continued to climb up, when his four claws were covered in this thick mucus, it would be difficult for him to move. His claws might not even be able to grab the bark and he would fall down. Or, he would be stuck to the mucus because of exhaustion. He could not go up or retreat and would starve to death\!

Chu Xiaoye sighed at the wonders of the Creator. He had a clearer understanding of this super huge tree's immortal body.

These amber thick mucus should have been secreted by this super tree on its own accord to protect itself. Any insects or beasts that were disadvantageous to it would shrink back.

Those who dared to challenge it would probably be glued to the tree trunk waiting to die.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to climb up again. At the same time, he realized that the mucus on his claws and feet was becoming drier and firmer. If he did not retreat now, his claws would not be able to use any strength on the bark. He could only slip and fall.

Before the mucus completely dried, Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped down.

Due to the fact that his four claws were covered in mucus, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to retract his claws back into his feet, afraid that he would bring the mucus in. At that time, he would stick his claws in there and not be able to bounce them out. That would be terrible.

This incomparably sharp golden claw that could pierce bones actually lost completely in front of this mucus and lost all its sharpness.

Using softness to counter hardness was indeed an unchanging truth since ancient times.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and roared, warning Little Curly Tail and the others sternly that they could not climb everywhere, let alone climb up the tree trunk. They had to stay away from the mucus.

He did not dare to hesitate and immediately walked towards the river not far away with his claws full of mucus.

His movements became a little comical.

Alisa followed and deliberately walked beside him. She tilted her head and looked at him, gloating.

She should have already seen how terrifying the mucus was.

Chu Xiaoye's feet were starting to be covered in mud and leaves. He even touched some branches. No matter how he swung, he could not take them off.

After this mucus dried, it was comparable to 502 glue in the human world\!

Chu Xiaoye was a little afraid and immediately ran towards the river.

Beside him, Alisa ran with him, still tilted her head and looking at him as a joke. The corner of her mouth cracked open and she let out mocking laughter.

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He suddenly turned around and pounced on her, pushing her to the ground. His four claws rubbed against her fur.

In the end, after rubbing a few times, four claws stuck to her fur and he could not move anymore\!

Chu Xiaoye panicked and started to pull with all his might.

Alisa gritted her teeth in pain and roared.

When the pride heard the noise and hurriedly ran over, they saw that their abdomens were facing each other, their heads were facing each other, and their limbs were wrapped around each other intimately.

"Disperse\! Disperse\! Everything's fine\!"

Seeing this scene, Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur that came over immediately growled and turned to leave. They urged everyone to leave and not disturb the king.

The king was working hard for the strengthening and future of the pride. He worked hard and could not be disturbed. Looking at the king's grimace and painful expression, he knew how difficult it was for the king.
