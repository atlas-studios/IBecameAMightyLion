Chapter 446: Untitled

Soon.

The black antelope widened its eyes and died completely\!

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and carefully observed the bushes around him. He did not find any signs of other ferocious beasts, nor did he smell the scent left behind by other ferocious beasts.

Beside the black antelope's corpse, other than grass, flowers, and bushes, there was nothing else that was fatal.

Could it be that this black antelope had suddenly died of illness because it was chased by the cheetah ferociously and was too terrified?

At this moment, Little Curly Tail, who had crawled out from behind, suddenly walked forward and prepared to bring the corpse of the black antelope out to enjoy.

Before he could touch the corpse, Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and slapped him. He roared and told him to scram.

This black antelope had died for no reason and could not be eaten\!

Little Curly Tail looked at him aggrievedly and hurriedly retreated.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and warned the other members sternly. This black antelope could not be touched or touched.

Unexpectedly, just as he finished warning them, Alisa, who was standing at the side, immediately stuck out her claws and nudged him. She slanted her eyes and looked at him provocatively, as if she was saying, "I touched it. Bite me?"

This fellow's orders were useless to her\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored her, turned around, and crawled out of the bushes, continuing forward with the pride.

At the same time, he snorted coldly in his heart. "Don't be anxious. After I settle down here, I'll do as you wish\!"

Alisa crawled out of the bushes and followed silently. Her eyes flickered and she was a little flustered by his disregard just now.

She knew clearly that this fellow was not to be trifled with. She had insulted him just now, but he did not have any reaction. It was not that the other party was afraid of him. It was very possible that this pervert was brewing an even more violent revenge.

She was so flustered.

Not long after Chu Xiaoye left with the pride, a monkey suddenly jumped to the side of the black antelope's corpse. It bulged its big eyes and looked at it curiously for a while. Then, it extended its claws and carefully fiddled with it.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a black object that looked like a venomous snake suddenly shot out from the colorful flower at the side and wrapped around the monkey's neck\!

The monkey was frightened. Just as it was about to struggle and escape, its body suddenly turned limp and it fell to the ground with its eyes wide open. It first twisted a few times, then raised its head and did not move.

The black object slowly loosened and retreated into the stamen of the flower like a long tongue, disappearing.

Here, peace returned.

After a long time, the soil under the flower suddenly started to tremble. Then, black roots crawled out of the ground like long earthworms and slowly crawled towards the corpses of the monkey and the black antelope.

After crawling onto their bodies, the roots continued to wriggle and extend. They twisted and followed the nostrils, ears, mouths, eyes, and other parts of the bodies into their bodies.

The beautiful flower was the size of a lotus and red and blue. The petals that had yet to open completely started to slowly stretch. After stretching to the largest extent, they slowly closed again. They repeated this as if they were breathing and enjoying it.

Black juice like ink flowed out of the black roots and entered the corpses of the monkey and the black antelope, starting to melt the flesh inside.

Hence, the colorful flower became even redder, like blood, and blue. It almost turned black and looked extremely demonic\!

Soon, the two corpses started to rot from inside. Smelly juice flowed out of their bodies and landed in the soil on the ground.

The grass on the ground seemed to have started to sway and roar.

The surrounding bushes and trees swayed in the wind, as if they were happy with this delicious nutrition.

The stench of corpses drifted in the bushes.

Many colorful poisonous bugs crawled out of the darkness and came to enjoy a feast.

In a few days, not even bones would be left of these two corpses.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and finally arrived in front of the super tree.

When he came close, he was really shocked.

This super huge tree was terrifyingly big, and even lions were afraid. It was like an old demon that had become a spirit. Be it the terrifying thick tree trunk, the threatening branches on it, or even the wrinkled bark, they all looked ancient and terrifying.

At the bottom of the super huge tree, many thick roots arched up and pierced into the soil, forming many natural caves that could hide from the wind and rain.

Even if the entire pride lay inside, it was extremely spacious.

However, it was dark and damp inside. No one knew how many poisonous creatures were hiding inside.

Since he had decided to stay here, his first priority was to clean this natural house under the tree.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light as he pierced through the darkness and looked at the dark cave below. However, he did not see anything, nor were there any ferocious beasts hiding here.

However, not seeing it did not mean that there was none.

Chu Xiaoye growled and let the members of the pride stand further away. He prepared to clean this cave.

As for what to use to clean it up?

Naturally, he used smoke\!

However, fire definitely could not be used.

After everyone stood far away, Chu Xiaoye took a deep breath and brewed himself a little. Then, he aimed his butt at the cave under the giant tree and curled his tail.

"Pfft—"

An explosion\!

Black smoke rolled out and swept in like a storm\!

This fart lasted for a long time\!

Soon, the extremely smelly black smoke filled the entire space under the giant tree and started to crawl into every gap inside.

Before long, a big colorful centipede half a meter long fled from the black smoke in panic. Then, it shook its head and wagged its tail, fleeing drunkenly.

If even this poison could not withstand it, let alone other poisonous creatures.

Soon, a large group of blood-red ants fled in a hurry. They stopped outside for a moment, seemingly unwilling to let go of the ant queen inside. Just as they were about to turn around and rush in, they swayed and fell to the ground. They struggled with all their might, but could not get up.

Suddenly, a few more colorful venomous snakes fled in panic\!

Then, another group of fat rats rushed out\!

In less than a moment, hundreds of different poisonous creatures rushed out from under the super tree. They were all flustered and looked like they were facing a great enemy. They even fainted from the smell just as they escaped\!

"Pfft—"

As for Chu Xiaoye, his farts were still endless\!

He narrowed his eyes and revealed an extremely enjoyable expression.

The members of the pride hurriedly retreated further.

Alisa was dumbfounded as she jumped onto the tree. At the same time, she was secretly worried. This fellow's weapon is so strong and his endurance is so strong. I'm afraid it won't be easy to deal with in the future.
