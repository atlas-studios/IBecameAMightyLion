Chapter 77: The Battle for Food

"Roar—"

The cold father roared and hurriedly jumped away\!

Although he did not know this fellow, his animal instincts made him feel that this fellow was not simple.

Although this fellow did not have the armor of a crocodile and those two rows of cold sharp teeth, the aura and courage it displayed at this moment made him somewhat afraid.

The female lions also hurriedly dodged and did not dare to fight.

The Komodo Dragon flaunted its might and started to sway its body, spitting its tongue as it chased after the female lions.

The cold father was furious. He turned around and followed behind it, preparing to attack from behind.

The female lions quickly calmed down and surrounded it.

Coincidentally, the pride was hungry and wanted to hunt. Since this fellow came knocking on their door, they could only accept it\!

Although the Komodo Dragon was surrounded by the pride, it did not seem to be flustered. It opened its mouth and bit Xi'er.

It seemed to have never experienced the claws and skills of these kings of the grassland\!

It was as confident as a true king\!

Xi'er nimbly jumped away to dodge.

The lioness with a broken tail suddenly jumped up from the side and grabbed its back\!

At the same time, the cold father rushed up and bit its tail\!

As for Aisha, she jumped onto its back like she was hunting a herbivore and opened her mouth to bite its neck\!

However, before she could lower her head, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped over from the side. With a bang, he suddenly hit her body and knocked her off the back of the Komodo Dragon\!

The Komodo Dragons were also called venomous dragons. They had extremely terrifying venom glands growing in their bodies. Even an adult water buffalo and an elephant could not resist this venom. A few days after being bitten, they would die from shock.

And this venomous gland might be hiding on both sides of the mouth or near the neck.

If it was bitten and flowed into her mouth, the consequences would be unimaginable\!

Aisha was knocked to the ground and quickly got up. She looked at her son in shock.

The other members of the pride were also puzzled.

Little Curly Tail hurriedly ran to his brother's side and rubbed his head against his body to calm him down.

He could tell.

His brother was in a bad mood today.

However, even if he was in a bad mood, he should not attack his mother.

At this moment, the Komodo Dragon hurriedly turned its head and bit at the cold father who was biting its tail\!

The cold father immediately let go and jumped back.

Xi'er took the opportunity to attack again. She immediately attacked and grabbed the back of the Komodo Dragon\!

The lioness with a broken tail also took the opportunity to attack\!

Aisha wanted to help, but she saw that her two sons were staring at her. They did not seem to want her to go forward. She hesitated for a moment and could only give up.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out to the cold father and the other lionesses, reminding them to be careful and not to be bitten by this monster.

Although every animal had its own way of communicating, Chu Xiaoye was not sure if they could understand.

Actually, even if they understood, other than his mother, who would listen to him?

As the king of the pride, the lion, the cold father, they would never listen to him.

He continued to lead the three female lions to attack the Komodo Dragon with drool dripping from the corner of his mouth.

This was a feast\!

Although this crocodile-like fellow looked fierce, he did not seem to be terrifying.

Its skin was not as thick as that of a crocodile's, and its teeth were not as strong as that of a crocodile's. To the cold father and the three female lions, this was a beautiful meal that came knocking on their door\!

They naturally would not let him go.

Chu Xiaoye asked Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to stand further away.

He walked to his mother's side and rubbed her head, as if apologizing. Before his mother could rub her head against him, he suddenly used more strength and pushed her further away.

Aisha could not stop retreating as she looked at him in a daze.

Chu Xiaoye walked towards the Komodo Dragon and prepared to use his right claw to end the battle quickly and open its stomach\!

This thing was too dangerous. If they continued to pester him, the cold father and the three female lions would be in big trouble if they were suddenly bitten.

At this moment, the Komodo Dragon finally understood how cunning and terrifying these kings of the grassland were.

It could not bite them at all, but they were constantly exhausting its energy and scratching its body\!

When it advanced, the other party retreated. When it retreated, the other party advanced\!

It could not take care of both its head and tail, and could only take damage continuously.

If this continued, it would definitely die on the spot\!

Therefore, it decided to escape\!

Before Chu Xiaoye could walk over, the Komodo Dragon jumped towards the bushes at the side with a whoosh.

The cold father and the three female lions naturally would not let the matter rest. They hurriedly chased after him.

Right at this moment, the grass in front of them swayed. A lion with a black mane suddenly walked out and blocked the Komodo Dragon.

This was Seno Sr, one of the Seno brothers\!

At this moment, Seno Jr brought the five female lions out from the bushes at the back. He looked coldly at the pride of the cold father and then looked covetously at the prey in front of him.

They did not know this Komodo Dragon.

However, it seemed that this fellow had quite a bit of meat. It was enough for every member of their pride to eat a few bites with relish.

They were very hungry.

"Roar—"

The cold father bared his fangs and let out a hoarse roar.

Xi'er and the other lionesses also roared angrily.

They never would have thought that the Seno brothers' pride had yet to leave and were still lingering in their territory, even tailing them\!

Now, they were actually going to snatch their prey again\!

How despicable\!

"Roar—"

The Seno brothers' pride also let out provocative roars, showing no fear.

They invaded the territories of other prides and snatched the prey of other prides and did not feel any shame or guilt\!

In this world, the fittest survived while the weak were prey to the strong\!

The Seno brothers' pride was stronger than the pride of the cold father. This was the reason, this was the rule\!

They would only be more arrogant and confident\!

Of course, they would be even more fearless\!

The Seno brothers stood together majestically, looking at the cold father with disdain and provocation, as if they were waiting for him to fight.

Xi'er, Aisha, the lioness with a broken tail, and the pregnant Maya all came to the side of the cold father. Their eyes were filled with anger. They were roaring and preparing to fight side by side with their king for their territory and food\!

The five female lions of the Seno brothers' pride also roared in response. They were not weak and had high fighting spirit.

Lars looked fearfully at the two adult lions opposite him and hesitated, not daring to go forward.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail, they were already standing behind their mothers.

Even Mei Mei stood with her mother without hesitation and bared her sharp fangs.

The Komodo Dragon, who was trapped between the two prides, was finally afraid. It did not know where to run.

It had never seen how terrifying this grassland was\!
