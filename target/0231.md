Chapter 231: Run, Brother Smelly Fart\!

 Could he be seeing things?

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes and shook his head. He opened his eyes again to look.

The little white lion's whisker was still shining and exceptionally striking.

"Bam\!"

The little white lion suddenly raised its claws and slapped his head. It glanced at him with a proud and arrogant look, as if it was saying, "Why do you keep staring at me? Have you never seen such a beautiful golden-clawed little beauty?"

This female cub was really narcissistic.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his claws and looked at her golden claws again, feeling a little depressed.

He originally thought that he was the only lion that would have such cool and powerful golden claws. He did not expect this female cub to have them too\!

He was really unhappy.

Since this female cub made him unhappy, she could forget about being happy\!

"Pfftâ€”"

He suddenly turned around, curled his tail, and spat a big fart at the female cub. Then, his body shot out like a rocket.

The little white lion, Tilly, was caught off guard and was pushed back by the air wave for four to five meters\!

Then, she was furious. She immediately held her breath and chased after him\!

The fur on her tail stood up and she suddenly swung her arms and legs. With a whoosh, she actually jumped more than ten meters away\!

Chu Xiaoye stopped farting and quickly swam up, preparing to use his golden claws to break the ice.

However, just as he swam up for a distance, a huge wave suddenly swept over from behind and sent him flying.

Before he could steady himself, two huge seals the size of calves suddenly jumped out from the side and caught him in the middle, quickly swimming back.

When Chu Xiaoye reacted, the two sea leopards had already brought him in front of the little white lion.

Tilly stood on a rock and looked at him proudly. She opened her mouth and spat out a series of bubbles, as if she was saying, "Run, continue running. Why aren't you running anymore?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her coldly with disdain.

This female cub only knew how to use bodyguards. If she did have ability, she would not let the bodyguards help her and fight him herself\!

The dignified snow mountain white lion did not even have this little bit of courage?

Tilly seemed to understand what he meant. She raised her claws and waved them, letting the two seals leave.

The two seals immediately let go of Chu Xiaoye and swam away quickly.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. This female cub's ability to hold her breath was impressive. She could even command these sea leopards and had two rhinoceros guards in the past. It seemed that her identity was not simple.

Could she be the daughter of a certain lion king at the top of the snow mountain?

Hmph\!

Even so, so what?

He, Chu Xiaoye, was the future king of beasts. Why would he be afraid of a little girl?

When the two seals walked far away, he immediately rushed over and prepared to teach this female cub a deep lesson. He wanted her to cry for her parents and regret escaping from her mother's stomach\!

"Whoosh\!"

He rushed over and stopped in front of the female cub. Then, he lowered his head and licked her claws to show his respect.

The female cub grinned and raised her claws to stroke his head as a compliment.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the two huge elephant-like creatures behind her and the corner of his mouth twitched.

What world was this? Even a rhinoceros could dive?

They had agreed to fight alone. With these two ferocious big fellows standing behind them, who would dare to attack?

It was too unfair\!

After Tilly finished touching his head, she jumped up from the rock. She spread her limbs and rode on him. She patted his head with her claws and pointed up, signaling that he should go up.

They were really bullies\!

He had just treated the little white tiger as a horse to ride. Now, he was being ridden by this little white lion. Could this be retribution?

Two huge rhinoceroses arrived close to him like two mountains.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly carried the little white lion and swam up.

"Crack\!"

Just as he reached the layer of ice on it, before Chu Xiaoye could extend his claws, the little white lion on his back swiped with its claws and the thick layer of ice actually broke open.

Then, the little white lion suddenly slapped with its claws again. The entire ice layer shattered, revealing a big hole.

Chu Xiaoye's heart shrank. This little white lion's golden claws did not look any weaker than his. In fact, they were even stronger.

This immediately turned his intention to launch a sneak attack into nothingness.

Her current strength was clearly not inferior to his. He did not know if it was the strong genes in her body or some natural treasure that made her growth faster in all aspects than other mutants.

This was very unfair to all animals.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that there was no absolute fairness in this world, especially in the animal world.

To other animals, he was also a cheat, right?

However, he had just escaped the tiger's mouth and entered the lion's mouth. His luck was really bad and he could be said to be full of bad luck.

Under the surveillance of the two giant rhinoceroses, he obediently carried the little white lion and climbed to the ground.

His entire body was wet and he shivered when the cold wind blew.

He could not help but shake the fur on his body and shake the little white lion off his back, causing it to fall to the ground.

"Boom\!"

A large layer of ice suddenly flew up.

The two giant rhinoceroses got up from the water and stared at him coldly.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that the sharpest part of the rhinoceros horns on the foreheads of the two rhinoceroses flickered with a small circle of light. It was like the light of the whisker at the corner of the little white lion's mouth when they were underwater just now.

What was going on?

Tilly was lying on the ground and unwilling to get up. She still looked sorry as if she had been thrown to the ground by him.

The two rhinoceroses lowered their heads angrily, killing intent surging as they prepared to attack.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and immediately walked to the little white lion's side. He lay down and gestured for her to get on his back. He also stuck out his tongue to lick her head to express his sincere apology.

Tilly was very pleased with herself. She immediately jumped up and rode on his back. She slapped his head and let him set off with a roar.

Chu Xiaoye stood up, smirked, and started farting.

Farting underwater had no effect, but it was different up there.

In an instant, black fog surged. The two rhinoceroses following behind immediately froze in place with confused expressions.

A large black fog covered Chu Xiaoye and the little white lion on his back.

The little white lion vomited and fell from his back. It rolled and crawled, preparing to escape the black fog with a terrified expression.

"Bam\!"

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately pounced on her and pushed her to the ground. He raised his claws and started slapping her face.

He slapped it more than twenty times in a row, causing the little white lion to be dizzy. It cried out as it vomited non-stop and could not resist at all.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and suddenly sat on her face. With a puff, he spat out black smoke again and left.

However, when he walked out of the black smoke and prepared to escape, he suddenly realized that there was a circle of giant rhinoceroses surrounding the black smoke\!

There were more than ten of them\!

The rhinoceroses all had cold gazes and looked at him with a murderous aura. They almost surrounded the path around him tightly\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He immediately raised his claws and greeted them. Then, he quickly turned around and returned to the black smoke.

In order to prevent the black smoke from dissipating too quickly, he farted a few more times.

He came in front of the little white lion and reached out to stroke her head while sticking out his tongue to lick her fur, indicating that he did not mean to fart just now. He hoped that she could forgive him.

The little white lion lay on the ground and vomited. Its mind was blank. It did not know where it was, let alone who she was.

Chu Xiaoye thought that when the smoke cleared and this lioness cub woke up, she would definitely take revenge and humiliate and bully him fiercely.

Hence, he raised his claws again and slapped the female cub mercilessly.

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

When the black smoke gradually dispersed, the rhinoceroses quickly surrounded them.

At this moment, they saw that the little lion was carrying their Missy and vomiting on the ground.

As Chu Xiaoye vomited, he pretended to be struggling as he stood up with the little white lion on his back, indicating that he was very innocent. He did not know who let out that big smelly fart. It must have been some bad skunk that passed by\!

The rhinoceroses stared at him coldly, not believing his lie.

Not only was Tilly vomiting, blood was also flowing from the corner of her mouth. The fur on her head was messy. She had clearly been abused fiercely.

The rhinoceroses were furious, but they did not dare to attack.

Because this despicable and cunning fellow was carrying their Missy on his back as a hostage.

Chu Xiaoye looked at their reactions and secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He hurriedly carried the little white lion and walked towards the forest.

The two rhinoceroses blocking the front hesitated for a moment and made way.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly happy.

When he reached the forest, he would be like a fish in water and would never be afraid of these violent monsters again.

Right at this moment, a loud and clear cry suddenly came from the sky.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw a huge snow eagle circling low above their heads, staring at them with a sharp gaze.

Tilly, who was on his back, stopped retching. She looked up at the snow eagle and then turned to look at the rhinoceroses behind her. Her gaze flickered and she suddenly leaned close to Chu Xiaoye's ear. She let out a small whimper, as if she was whispering to him.

"Your Majesty, quickly elope with me\! We'll wander the world and never be apart\!"

Chu Xiaoye thought that was what she meant. He curled his lips in disdain and rejected her, indicating that she was dreaming. Don't even think about it\!

However, what Tilly meant was, "Smelly fart king, quickly escape with me\! If you help me escape from these fellows, I'll give you the privilege of licking my feet and make you my slave\!"

Just as they entered the forest, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and threw her down mercilessly. Then, he ran away\!

After running for a distance, the little white lion that he threw off suddenly fell from the sky with a bang and rode on his back again. It roared excitedly.

"Run\! Brother smelly fart\!"

In the sky, the cry of the snow eagle resounded through the clouds.

Behind him, the ground trembled as the ten-over giant rhinoceroses chased after him angrily.

Chu Xiaoye was anxious and angry. He did not dare to stop and could only turn his head and suddenly bite the little white lion on his back. In the end, he bit her lips.
