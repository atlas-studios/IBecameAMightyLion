Chapter 433: Untitled

After a short rest, they continued on their way.

Although most of the members of the pride were injured in the battle just now, this was not a place to stay for long. They had to leave as soon as possible.

The corpses and blood all over the ground would definitely attract other predators.

Every minute they stayed here meant more danger.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and saw that everyone was covered in wounds and in a sorry state. The Jiela sisters even lowered their heads with dejected expressions, as if they were mourning for the four sisters who had died tragically.

Although they won this battle, they also paid a heavy price.

They did not even have the chance to enjoy the flesh on the ground.

He could only leave with his wounds and hunger.

They, who had been invincible on the grassland, had just arrived when the first wave of enemies they encountered fell into such a sorry state.

This might be a beautiful paradise, a land that was very suitable for animals to live in. However, if they really wanted to take root here and survive, it would not be so easy.

"Roarâ€”"

The pride had just walked a few steps when a few roars immediately sounded from the place full of corpses behind them. Then, the sounds of an intense battle came.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride covered in wounds and quickened his steps.

At this time, if they encountered another powerful team, their casualties would be even greater.

For safety reasons, Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and left the team and walked at the front to scout the way.

If they encountered danger, they could also quickly alert the pride at the back.

In the evening, they came in front of a waterfall halfway up the mountain.

The rumbling sounds of the waterfall covered the sounds of their movements. The gurgling stream could wash away the blood on their bodies.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up a big tree, his eyes flickering with a golden light. He checked the surroundings and after confirming that it was safe, he let the pride stop here to rest.

Although most members were unwilling to shower, under Chu Xiaoye's orders, they had no choice but to jump down the stream and wash the blood and dirt on their fur while trembling in the cold stream.

The cute violent bear and her son jumped into the stream happily to fish and eat.

The big black bear also threw away the little girl's dress and joined in with a thud.

The human little girl was naturally the one who yearned for and liked bathing the most.

She had not bathed for many days. Her gazelle skin was also covered in mud. Her golden hair no longer had elasticity and softness. She looked dirty, like a little beggar.

Everyone splashed in the stream, but it was only to deal with Chu Xiaoye's orders. Whether they could wash themselves clean was another matter.

The little girl picked up her dress from the ground and walked upstream to the pool under the waterfall. She looked around and placed her dress on the ground. Then, she quickly took off the dirty gazelle skin on her body and prepared to jump down.

However, at this moment, a cold wind suddenly blew, causing her to tremble.

The splashing water when the waterfall fell landed on her body, waking her up. The pool of water in front of her was so cold. To strong lions, it might only make them tremble for a while, but to a weak human like her, a bath might kill her.

The flu and fever here were not ordinary illnesses.

The little girl crossed her arms and cowered as she stood by the pool, trembling and feeling quite conflicted.

She had already taken off his clothes, so how could he retreat at the last moment?

However, it was so cold\!

Suddenly, the little girl subconsciously turned around and looked at the young lion king that had arrived in front of her at some point in time. She blinked her beautiful blue eyes and her expression immediately changed. She hurriedly squatted down and blushed.

"Bad king\! Rogue\!"

The little girl cowered tightly, embarrassed and angry.

If it was really an ordinary lion, it would be fine. However, the lion in front of her was not simple. It was intelligent and could communicate with her. It could even write and understand her words\!

Other than his body appearance, how was he different from a human?

Therefore, she had to be shy.

However, Chu Xiaoye stood beside her and stared at her sharply. The corner of his mouth was slightly curled, as if he was looking at a joke.

The little girl was anxious and her face was red. She could only squat on the ground and hug her body tightly. Like a duck, she swayed left and right and moved towards the pool bit by bit. Then, she gritted her teeth and fell into the pool in front of her with a splash.

She was a ruthless person\!

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He hurriedly walked forward and looked down. This pool was not shallow.

He was forcing this little girl to go into the water, not forcing her to kill herself.

Fortunately, the little girl immediately popped out of the pool. Her two snow-white and thin arms moved gently in the water, swimming around like a fish.

It seemed that she was not weak in swimming.

The little girl swam around the pool before looking up and grinning at Chu Xiaoye. "Bad king, the water is so warm. It's not cold at all. Do you want to come down and join us?"

Before Chu Xiaoye could answer, her face turned stiff again. She pouted and snorted. "No way\! The bad king is a gangster\!"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her. He extended his claws and pulled her gazelle skin down, then turned to leave.

The little girl hurriedly swam towards the shore and grabbed the gazelle skin before it could sink into the water. As she rubbed it, she bathed. After a while, she started humming and looked very happy.

The big black bear was fishing and eating with the cute violent bear and her son. When it heard the song, it looked up and immediately ran upstream excitedly, as if it was preparing to shower with the little girl.

However, just as it was about to run close to the pool, the little girl immediately shouted, "Tibbs\! You're not allowed to come over\! You smell bad. Wash yourself clean there\!"

The little girl was not as polite to it as she was to Chu Xiaoye. Her words were like an order, but the mighty and tall black bear was very obedient. As if it had received an imperial edict, it immediately stayed there and did not dare to take another step forward. It had an aggrieved expression, as if it was complaining. "Your Highness, I'm so sad."

Chu Xiaoye felt that this scene was very magical.

This strange combination seemed to have been destined a long time ago. Their friendship had yet to be established and their feelings had yet to be nurtured when they suddenly reached a stage where their hearts were connected and their master and servant relationship was deep.

No matter what they wanted to express, the other party could immediately understand.

Not only could the little girl make the big black bear obey her orders, she could also instantly give it magical strength, making the timid Tibbs immediately become brave and strong.

This was inexplicable, just like Annie's magic.

"Bad king\! You're peeping again\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was in a daze, the little girl raised her chin and made a face at him. She giggled, but she did not have any intention of being angry.

The big black bear turned to look at Chu Xiaoye and was even more depressed.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left. He walked to the spot where the cute bears were catching fish and jumped down.

He should take a good bath.

Just as he was seriously washing the mud on his body, an undercurrent suddenly came from the water, as if something was quietly approaching him.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly lowered his head and sank into the water, flicking his golden claw.

"Whoosh\!"

A black shadow suddenly pounced over and crawled into his arms. Its four legs hugged his body tightly and it twisted and rubbed like a water snake with a look of excitement and enjoyment.

It was the female leopard in heat\!

Chu Xiaoye put away his golden claw and suddenly slapped her head, telling her to scram.

However, it was not so easy to release strength underwater.

Belia was slapped by him, but she seemed fine and tightened her grip on him.

At this moment, not far away, Catherine also sank. Seeing this scene, she immediately floated up again. However, after a few seconds, she sank again.

Mei Mei, Molly, and even the cold father sank.

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He immediately increased his strength and pushed his claws forward, pushing the female leopard in his arms out. Then, he glared at the few dirty fellows and quickly floated up.

Obviously, the female leopard that looked like a piece of candy would not let the matter rest.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to flee ashore, a green light flashed in his eyes. He suddenly realized that three meters behind the little girl's bath, in the water curtain that fell from the waterfall, a huge python head was vaguely visible\!

Those scarlet and demonic eyes were like two lanterns that slowly drifted out of the water curtain\!
