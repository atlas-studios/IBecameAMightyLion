Chapter 582: King of Beasts

"Don't be nervous\! Be more natural\!"

Chu Xiaoye wrapped his arm around the woman's waist and pretended to be drunk. He staggered past the two sentries.

The two sentries had just returned from drinking. Their eyes had been looking lasciviously at the woman's messy dress and body, and they did not look at Chu Xiaoye much.

"Tsk tsk, her figure is not bad. She seems to have just arrived today."

"Hehe, in a few days, we can play too."

Until Chu Xiaoye brought the woman far away, the two sentries were still staring behind the woman and discussing.

The bonfire was still burning, but most of the participants had already dispersed.

Chu Xiaoye and the woman supported each other and followed behind a man and woman. They left the tent area and entered the village.

The soldiers guarding the forest at the village entrance were drinking and chatting, not paying attention.

At this moment, many people returned in groups of three or two. As long as they did not have scarlet eyes and strange manners, they would not care.

Chu Xiaoye held the woman hostage and successfully entered the village.

The woman did not know that those animals were imprisoned there, but Chu Xiaoye could clearly ask about the aura emitted by those animals.

He brought the woman and staggered forward under the light, encountering a few patrolling soldiers.

The soldiers looked at them and asked, "Where to?"

Chu Xiaoye leaned his head on the woman's shoulder and buried his face in her golden hair. The sharp army knife in his hand almost pierced into her skin.

The woman was terrified and trembled. "In front… in front of us is the residence General Loster found for us."

The patrolling soldiers immediately became respectful when they heard that.

"So you're General Loster's friend. You must have just arrived today, right? Alright, go and rest. You drank so much. Don't fall."

A few soldiers smiled and reminded him before leaving quickly.

The woman heaved a sigh of relief and continued forward.

The front started to turn dark and the lights had long been extinguished.

The woman looked ahead and was a little afraid. She started to slow down and said with a trembling voice, "Can you, can you not move forward anymore? Please…"

Chu Xiaoye did not answer. He wrapped his arm tightly around her waist and continued forward.

"Roar —"

Suddenly, a pair of green eyes and a strong black shadow appeared in a dark corner.

It was a big hunting dog\!

The woman's entire body was trembling and her face was pale. She immediately stopped in her tracks and did not dare to move forward.

However, how could she win against Chu Xiaoye in strength?

Chu Xiaoye hugged her and continued forward, walking towards the big hunting dog that was baring its fangs and looking at her coldly.

The big hunting dog roared again and pounced ferociously\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye kicked it and hit its head\!

A huge force smashed into the big hunting dog's head, and the big hunting dog was sent flying. It fell heavily into a dark corner and instantly died without even letting out a scream\!

Suddenly, the other two hunting dogs guarding the door heard the noise and ran over, letting out fierce roars.

Chu Xiaoye wrapped his arm around the woman's waist and faced her.

The two hunting dogs were extremely fierce. They suddenly jumped up, bared their fangs, and pounced at the two of them.

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye flew up twice again and kicked their heads heavily, sending them flying and dying instantly\!

The woman beside him trembled and was even more terrified.

"Continue walking\!"

Chu Xiaoye instructed coldly.

This time, the woman was clearly much more obedient. Even though she was trembling violently, she still walked forward in fear.

"Who is it?"

Suddenly, two soldiers walked out of a corner with an AK in their hands and looked at the two of them suspiciously.

Before Chu Xiaoye could answer, one of the soldiers waved his hand and chased him away. "Leave quickly\! This is not a place you can come to\! If you want to have an affair, go to the wild\!"

The other soldier glanced at the two of them and looked at the woman's torn chest. He chuckled and said, "I say, the two of you, let's return to the house. There are wild beasts everywhere. Be careful that you're eaten in one bite when you're happy."

Just as the two soldiers were laughing, Chu Xiaoye rushed over with a whoosh. He suddenly slashed with the military knife in his hand and cut their throats\!

The laughter from the two soldiers stopped abruptly. They widened their eyes and covered their bloody necks. They took a few steps back and fell to the ground.

They seemed to want to pull the trigger and remind the others but Chu Xiaoye broke their wrists with his feet.

The two soldiers twitched a few times and died.

The woman stood in place, her body limp. She fell to the ground and did not even have the courage to escape.

After Chu Xiaoye dragged the corpses of the two soldiers to a dark corner, he walked in front of her and extended his hand. "Get up\! Continue forward\!"

The woman could only get up shakily and lean on him, continuing forward.

The path ahead was even darker and there was almost no light.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye could clearly hear the low voices of the soldiers and the snores and movements of some animals.

The temporary zoo built by these humans was in front\!

Right at this moment, a black shadow suddenly jumped up from the bushes at the side. With a roar, it pounced at the woman\!

Its face was terrifying and its mane fluttered. It was actually a lion\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he immediately pulled the woman behind him and kicked the head of the lion.

This lion was at least 400 kilograms and was actually kicked to the ground\!

Chu Xiaoye clearly saw the mark left on its forehead by humans and the bloodthirsty cold light in its eyes.

"Roar —"

This lion suddenly roared angrily and pounced forward again, looking extremely fierce.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate anymore. He rushed up, jumped up, and brushed past the lion's head. Then, he suddenly stabbed down with the military knife in his hand and pierced into its head with a whoosh\!

As he flew forward, the military knife in his hand cut open the lion's head\!

"Bang\!"

The lion fell heavily to the ground, its head covered in blood. Its body twitched violently a few times and it died\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and immediately rushed in front of the woman. He did not have the time to drag the lion's corpse and ran forward.

"Bang\!"

Gunshots suddenly sounded in the darkness in front of him.

"What's going on? It seems to be Jack's roar. Is an enemy invading?"

The three soldiers held AKs and turned on the searchlight above them. As they spoke, they walked over and asked loudly, "Who is it\! Raise your hands\!"

They saw two figures.

Chu Xiaoye wrapped his arm around the woman's waist and continued to stumble forward. He shouted anxiously, "Save me\! There are lions\! We're General Loster's guests\! General Loster allowed us to come here to watch animals\!"

As he shouted, he hugged the woman and ran close.

When the three soldiers heard that, they immediately turned their guns that were pointing at them to the side and said loudly, "Honorable guests\! Now is not the time to watch animals\! During the day\! You can only come during the day\! Could it be that General Lost did not tell you?"

One of the soldiers passed by Chu Xiaoye and the woman. The searchlight on his head searched the darkness and he shouted, "Jack\! Don't bite\! Come out quickly\!"

He was shouting for the strong lion that had its genes injected.

Suddenly, the light above him shone on a patch of blood and the corpse of a lion.

"Whoosh\!"

Before he could react, a sharp military knife pierced into his neck\!

"You…"

The other two soldiers were stunned. Before they could react, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed close. He grabbed one of their necks and raised them up. Then, he suddenly used strength in his fingers and broke their necks with a crack\!

The three corpses fell to the ground together.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and felt that he seemed to be even more proficient in killing people.

The woman beside him fell to the ground in fear again, trembling violently.

At this moment, she was already useless.

Chu Xiaoye pulled out his army knife from the soldier's neck and squatted in front of the woman, looking at her coldly.

The woman trembled and cried, "No… Don't kill me…"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised the hilt of his knife and knocked the back of her head.

The woman's body turned limp and she fainted on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and looked at the darkness in front of him.

The aura of animals became stronger.

Many, many\!

The animals that were wandering and accepting their fate in the darkness seemed to have heard the noise outside or sensed something. They opened their eyes and stood up.

At the same time, gunshots and noisy cries suddenly came from the village not far away and were running over.

They were attracted by the gunshots and the roar of lions, or they had already discovered the corpse of the first soldier.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his body and turned into a huge lion. Then, he walked in front of the iron door and raised his sharp golden claws. With a whoosh, he cut off the hard steel\!

Sparks flew and the aura of a king erupted\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared inside, waking up the animals that were still sleeping and confused, numb and hesitant.

"Come with me\!"

He wanted to leave with them\!

His roar spread in the darkness, and his powerful lion king aura also filled the night.

In the dark corner, in the bushes, bushes, trees, and soil, pairs of green eyes suddenly lit up\!

He swung his golden claws again, cutting more steel and opening a larger prison door.

The animals imprisoned here finally woke up and roared as they rushed out.

Chu Xiaoye believed that as long as the cold father and Mei Mei were here, they would definitely be able to hear his roar and smell his scent.

He walked in and saw groups of ferocious beasts running out of the darkness, but he did not see the figures of the cold father and Mei Mei.

He jumped up high and looked down, still not seeing them.

He did not hesitate and immediately brought this group of ferocious beasts out of the cage and rushed towards the path at the side.

His huge body rushed at the front and when he encountered steel obstacles, he slashed open with his claws. When he encountered tall walls, he used his body to collide ferociously\!

The fence was crushed and the wall collapsed\!

More than 100 ferocious beasts followed behind him, roaring as they ran in the night\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Gunshots sounded from behind, but they were getting further and further away\!

Gunshots sounded in front of him, but they were extremely short.

Chu Xiaoye's entire body condensed a black armor and he was as fast as a ghost. Just as the soldier in front of him fired a few times, he swayed left and right and rushed up, killing the other party with one claw.

"Boom\!"

His huge and strong body broke through a thick wall and he quickly ran towards the grassland with the ferocious beasts that had escaped the cage\!

"Roar—"

The roar of the ferocious beast resounded through the night\!
