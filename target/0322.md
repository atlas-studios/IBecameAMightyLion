Chapter 322: 006

"Bang\!"

When the black lion king rushed to the bottom of the sand dune and raised its claws to grab Little Curly Tail's head, Chu Xiaoye suddenly arrived like a cannonball and suddenly hit the black lion king\!

The black lion king was sent flying and landed heavily on a bush more than ten meters away.

Chu Xiaoye rushed up again and jumped up. His golden claws flickered with a dazzling light under the sun\!

"Whoosh\!"

The golden claw drew a beautiful arc and slashed down\!

The black lion king turned around and got up. It did not dodge and faced the falling golden claw. It leaned forward and suddenly slapped\!

"Chi—"

An ear-piercing metallic noise sounded.

Sparks flew\!

Chu Xiaoye's sharp claws cut from the black lion king's head to the spine on its back, but he did not pierce through the fur at all, causing a series of sparks and a black mane\!

The black skin that was slashed by his golden claws shone faintly and flickered with a cold and demonic black light, like steel armor that had been tempered for many years\!

"Bang\!"

The black lion king's huge claws suddenly hit Chu Xiaoye's head.

Chu Xiaoye flew out.

He immediately felt his vision turn black and the world spin. His head was in extreme pain.

"Whoosh\!"

Before he could fall to the ground, Little Curly Tail, who had rushed over, immediately swung his tail and wrapped it around his body. After swinging it above his head and reducing its strength, he placed him on the ground.

Then, he roared angrily, swung his tail, and rushed towards the black lion king.

Balo looked at him coldly and disdainfully. He did not flee in a hurry like before. Instead, he stood in place, surprisingly calm.

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and stood up.

Catherine, Tilly, and Mei Mei hurriedly came to his side and looked at him with concern.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the lake and forest in the distance. The uneasiness in his heart grew stronger.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the black lion king suddenly roared angrily and pounced at Little Curly Tail.

The roar spread throughout the entire oasis, startling countless birds and small animals.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled as he looked into the distance again.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly swung his tail and slapped the black lion king's head heavily. However, the other party did not dodge, nor did it hurt. He pounced close and swung his huge claws.

Before Little Curly Tail could turn around, he was sent flying with a bang and fell miserably on the distant grass.

At this moment, Tilly, Catherine, and Mei Mei rushed up.

The black lion king turned around and fled again. It crawled into the bushes and ran towards the lake.

The three female lions followed closely.

Chu Xiaoye immediately chased after her with Little Curly Tail.

No matter what schemes the other party had, there was only one way to go now. That was to continue chasing until he killed the other party.

They were already exhausted and did not have the strength to climb up the sand dune again. If they gave up halfway and turned around to leave, they would probably have no strength after crawling halfway up the hill.

At that time, if the other party still had a backup plan, they would completely lose the ability to resist.

"Whoosh\!"

Tilly and Catherine suddenly jumped up and pounced at the black lion king.

The black lion king did not turn around. It swung its tail and slapped over.

Tilly faced it head-on, and Catherine dodged it. After landing, she jumped up again and swung her silver claw at the side of the black lion king's abdomen\!

The two female cubs, one gold and one silver, had exceptionally sharp claws, but they still only produced a series of sparks and did not even pierce the other party's skin.

Tilly was sent flying by the tail and landed lightly on the ground, continuing to chase after him.

Catherine's claw did not have any effect, but she did not give up. She attacked the same place again\!

This time, he scratched off a layer of black fur\!

Just as she was about to grab it for the third time, the black lion king suddenly roared angrily. It stopped in its tracks and pounced at her. Its ferocious face indicated that it was exceptionally furious at this moment\!

Catherine looked small and weak in front of his strong body, but she was exceptionally agile. She immediately put away her claws and jumped to the side.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as the black lion king was about to pounce on her again, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed over and suddenly grabbed the wound she had just left\!

Golden light flashed and sparks flew.

Then, blood splashed\!

The black lion king's steel armor finally broke\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly sounded from the bushes.

The black lion king widened its eyes in anger and pounced at Chu Xiaoye. Half of the fangs it bared turned black and flickered with a sharp metallic luster\!

Chu Xiaoye knew how terrifying this lion king was and immediately dodged.

"Bam\!"

The black lion king's claws slapped heavily on a small tree at the side\!

The small tree broke and flew out.

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps back and lowered his body, preparing for battle. Two golden lights flickered in his eyes, as dazzling as the sun above him.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail, Tilly, and Catherine all jumped over and surrounded the black lion king.

At this moment, no one would underestimate this black lion king again.

The speed, endurance, explosive strength, and all their strength that they were proud of paled in comparison to this black lion king.

In a one-on-one battle, no one was a match for this black lion king.

Even the proud Little Curly Tail's gaze was grave. He did not dare to be careless about the strength of this black lion king.

If Chu Xiaoye had not used a trick to break the other party's black lion army, he would rarely have a match in the entire grassland\!

This powerful lion king, who had entrusted the hope of all the black lions, had used his strength to prove his throne and honor. He lived up to his name\!

However, he was finally at the end of his flight.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye and the others did not have it easy either.

The chase for almost a day and night had exhausted the stamina of both sides.

Now, be it the black lion king or Chu Xiaoye and the others, they were panting and their limbs were trembling. They were exhausted.

As long as he relaxed, he would fall to the ground and never get up again.

However, at this moment, no one could relax. They could only risk it all and kill the other party\!

After a short pause and rest, both sides sized up each other again.

Balo's gaze stopped on Chu Xiaoye.

As for Chu Xiaoye, his gaze stopped at the side of his right front leg.

There was a vague imprint, a serial number that only belonged to human civilization—006.

Indeed, such a powerful lion king was not born nor was it brought about by the mutation. Instead, it was humans who had done something to it.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye knew that there was no turning back. This black lion king had to die\!

The sun fell to the horizon.

The distant lake was colorful.

This beautiful place was destined to have a bloody battle\!
