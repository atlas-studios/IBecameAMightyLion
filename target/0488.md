Chapter 488: White Tiger

"Bang\!"

The wide sword seemed to be dancing too happily and did not want to stop. After spinning the petite Vilis more than ten times, it threw her to the ground.

Vilis lay on the ground for a few seconds before jumping up. Although she stood very steadily, her eyes were still rolling.

She was so dizzy.

The eight orcs were already beheaded.

The old orc woman was also cut in half and fell into a pool of blood.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye started to envy the human body again.

At least, they could use weapons and move faster than wild beasts.

This little girl, who was called the Chief Great Swordmaster of the elves, had been cold and indifferent previously and was unwilling to even look at them. Now, she suddenly chased after them. Clearly, something had changed.

Chu Xiaoye did not relax his vigilance.

It would naturally be best if this little girl could help him point the way. However, if the other party wanted to be rough, he would definitely not show mercy.

"Hey, that… Baldy, it's like this."

Vilis carried the big iron sword and walked over with a cold expression. She slanted her eyes and pretended to be arrogant. "Annie said that you saved her, right? Us elves will repay kindnesses and will not be petty. The two of you follow me back. I will help Annie thank you."

As he spoke, he walked in front of Chu Xiaoye and grabbed the sword hilt with both hands, his eyes burning.

Chu Xiaoye was already suspicious of her actions of chasing after him. Seeing her expression, he was even more suspicious.

However, it was best not to attack if he could.

He did not want to anger this strong little loli with a huge sword.

He extended his claws and wrote a few words on the ground. "Where's Annie? Why isn't she here?"

In comparison, he naturally trusted the little girl more.

If the little girl said the same thing to him, he would definitely follow her without hesitation.

"You know how to write?"

Vilis widened her eyes and looked at the line of small words on the ground in shock.

Then, her eyes burned even more.

She gripped the hilt of her sword tightly, her face still cold. "Annie went back first. She told me to chase you and bring you back. Go, don't dawdle."

Chu Xiaoye was even more certain that this elf with a huge sword definitely had ill intentions and had unspeakable intentions towards him\!

Perhaps she saw that he was handsome and mighty and wanted to kidnap him back to be a man\!

"Sorry, I'm not interested in your place."

Chu Xiaoye rejected it very clearly. Then, he retreated step by step and prepared to leave.

Vilis narrowed her eyes and gripped the wide sword hilt tightly with her two little hands. She did not speak anymore and stood in place, staring at him with a cold gaze.

After Chu Xiaoye took more than ten steps back, he immediately turned around and left quickly with Catherine.

He turned around and saw that the elf with the huge sword did not chase after him.

However, two hours later, they saw her again.

Vilis carried her huge sword and stood in place without moving, as if she was waiting for them specifically.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, they walked back after circling around the snow forest.

They were lost.

It was as if they had entered a dark forest that had been enchanted. They kept walking in place and could not leave.

"We thought about it and thought that we should go back with you. After all, we can't bear to let Annie go."

Chu Xiaoye was not embarrassed at all. He walked in front of the little elf and expressed his intentions.

Vilis looked at him coldly and did not speak. She led the way in front. When her back was facing them, the corner of the huge sword fairy's mouth curled up.

"However, I have to explain in advance. We will never sign any contract with any sprite or species. We will never be your mounts and slaves\!"

Chu Xiaoye made things clear first so that everyone would not be embarrassed.

Vilis stopped in her tracks and turned around. She said coldly, "I said that I brought you back to repay you. Don't worry."

Chu Xiaoye added, "I will never mate with other species\!"

He was afraid that the repayment this giant sword elf was talking about was making him the partner of a certain elf.

A mocking smile appeared on Vilis's face. "Don't worry. No one likes to let a bald beast be their mate."

"That's good."

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief, but he felt inexplicably uncomfortable.

He would turn around and look at his body. It was indeed a little ugly to be burned bald by the wing dragon's flames.

However, it was okay. New fur would grow out soon.

Under the lead of the giant sword elf, they finally passed through the snow forest and walked back onto the ice bridge.

Previously, when Chu Xiaoye and Catherine lost their way and prepared to return to the ice bridge to see the situation, they realized that they could not return no matter what. No matter how they walked, they would never find this ice bridge again.

Now, they were walking straight forward and did not make many turns before coming to this ice bridge.

It seemed that the ancient snow forest was indeed a little strange.

Annie was not waiting for them at the bridge. She probably left first.

When they walked across the ice bridge and came to the entrance built by boulders, two huge white tigers suddenly jumped out from the bushes on both sides of the door. They bared their fangs and let out terrifying growls.

Then, two young men in silver armor and holding spears walked out.

These two men had silver hair and sharp ears. They were tall and had snow-white skin. They were extremely handsome and were extremely beautiful.

But here, they were only guards.

"Lady Vilis, these two lions are…"

When the two men saw Vilis, they immediately retracted their hostility and were very respectful.

Vilis's expression was cold. "My new battle beast."

"Battle beast?"

When the two male elves heard this, they were shocked. They sized up the bald Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, feeling very puzzled.

Why would a swordmaster like Lady Vilis accept two such lions as war beasts? Even the two big white tigers guarding the door were stronger than these two lions, right?

However, Lady Vilis was not someone they could offend.

"Congratulations, Lady Vilis."

The two male elves smiled insincerely.

Vilis stopped talking and gestured for Chu Xiaoye and Catherine to follow.

"Battle beast?"

Chu Xiaoye was puzzled. What was this?

He knew that this giant sword elf was up to no good, but at this moment, he and Catherine had nowhere to go and could not even walk out of the snow forest. If they did not come here, where could they go?

He would find a place to stay and save his life before making plans.

Chu Xiaoye thought so, but his gaze was always fixed on the two mighty white tigers at the door.

He had once seen such a white tiger on the snow mountain outside.

Could it be that the disappeared snow mountain was actually here?
