Chapter 376: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Just as she was looking up at the sky in a daze, waves suddenly appeared in the river.

Chu Xiaoye dragged a huge crocodile out of the water and quickly jumped ashore, dragging the huge crocodile up.

Mei Mei hurriedly ran over to help.

However, the giant crocodile was motionless, as if it had long died.

Chu Xiaoye shook the water stains on his fur and looked at the dead crocodile in confusion. He circled around it and extended his claws to fiddle with it a few times, still finding any fatal wounds.

Before he entered the water, this giant crocodile had already become a corpse. It was stuck in the rocks at the bottom of the river and swayed by the water.

He searched the bottom of the river for a long time, but he did not see a crocodile or even a fish. He only saw this corpse.

There was nothing at the bottom of the river. This only crocodile had died strangely again.

What happened to this river? Where did those crocodiles go?

Mei Mei also circled the crocodile's corpse and suddenly thought of the huge white snow eagle in the sky. However, when she looked up again, the snow eagle was already nowhere to be seen.

"Plop\!"

Just as Mei Mei thought that her brother was going to bring the crocodile back to eat, she saw him raise his claws and actually throw the crocodile back into the river.

Lions usually only liked to eat fresh meat, but when there was a lack of food, they would also eat rotten meat.

The situation was critical now. The water buffaloes were blocking the front covetously and the nearby herbivores had fled without a trace. The food of the pride had already become a problem.

This crocodile was huge and had a lot of flesh. Furthermore, it had yet to rot. Why did his brother throw it away?

Chu Xiaoye did not explain anything and brought her along the river to continue searching.

However, until the sun was about to set, they did not discover any prey that they could hunt.

There were no crocodiles in the river, and no herbivores on the grassland.

Other than his team, there seemed to be only the huge water buffalo in his territory.

Chu Xiaoye was not worried about the food. He only felt that the current situation seemed to be a little wrong. As for what was wrong, he did not know.

The sun fell to the horizon and a day passed in the blink of an eye.

The water buffaloes guarding outside were lowering their heads to eat the grass under their feet as they waited solemnly.

They seemed to have made up their minds to force the pride away.

When Chu Xiaoye returned with Mei Mei, he saw Little Curly Tail slapping the flying white fur on the Baobab tree to entertain himself. Tilly, who was originally lying on the branch, had already disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. Had Tilly finally recovered her strength after taking off her fur?

However, there was no sign of Tilly around the camp.

When Little Curly Tail saw him return, he immediately jumped on the tree and roared excitedly. In one moment, he used his tail to slap the place where Tilly had slept. In another moment, he raised his head and looked at the sky.

The meaning he wanted to express was very obvious. "That little white lion was brought away by a bird."

The reason why he used the word "brought" and not "caught" was because when the little white lion was brought away by the bird, it was looking at him with its eyes open. It did not have any intention of resisting or asking for help. Instead, it had a calm expression.

Obviously, the huge bird was friends with the little white lion.

Little Curly Tail expressed excitedly on the tree, as if he wanted to be brought up by the bird like the little white lion.

Chu Xiaoye's heart sank. He jumped onto the Baobab tree with a whoosh and quickly ran to the top of the tree. He looked up and saw an empty sky. Other than that, he could not see anything.

The little white lion had long disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the top of the tree and looked blankly into the distance. He felt inexplicably disappointed and guilty.

In the distance, at the end of the grassland, there were continuous mountain ranges. Further away was the snow mountain that towered into the clouds.

That was Tilly's home.

Chu Xiaoye vaguely guessed the reason why the little white lion had lost its fur and spirit recently. It might have been away from home for too long, and she could not adapt to the climate and environment here.

Along the way, the little white lion had helped him a lot and risked life and death for him many times. Unfortunately, he chose to forget them and was very rough and impatient with her.

Now that he thought of it, he felt rather guilty.

Chu Xiaoye looked into the distance and raised his claws, revealing his golden claws like hers. He waved them at the distant snow mountain and muttered in his heart, "Girl, goodbye. I hope you can stay at home when you return and not run around anymore. Although the world outside is exciting, it's also dangerous."

Until the sun set, he came down from the top of the tree.

Little Curly Tail was still standing on the branch where Tilly had slept. He used his tail and claws to play with the white fur that was flying around.

Chu Xiaoye grinned and walked over happily. He slapped him, causing his head to tilt and he fell from the tree.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail curled his tail and hung it on the branch below. He swung it around the tree and landed steadily on the ground.

"Wuwu…"

Little Curly Tail raised his head and expressed his grievance. He did not seem to have done anything. How did he provoke his brother? He was just playing with Mao Mao.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the branch and looked at the white fur in front of him. It finally drifted down slowly and landed on the grass, like blooming flowers.

When the little girl on another Baobab tree saw these white fur, she suddenly said, "No wonder I always felt that those fur were very familiar. It turns out that…"

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her and was suddenly angry. He jumped over and slapped the branch beside her, looking at her fiercely.

The little girl was frightened by the swaying branches, but she was not afraid of his fierce expression and attitude at all. She pouted and said, "Bad king, you're deliberately scaring me again. I'm not afraid."

After saying that, she suddenly let go of the tree trunk and hugged his neck. She turned around and rode on his back, giggling. "Go\!"

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched and he was immediately furious. His body suddenly trembled and he slanted, sending the little girl on his back flying.

"Ah —"

The little girl screamed and fell from the tree.

Chu Xiaoye's muscles were tense. He narrowed his eyes and looked at Little Curly Tail under the tree.

Little Curly Tail stood under the tree, raised his head, and wagged his tail excitedly. He let out a roar, as if he was saying, "Good job, Brother\! Fall this ugly little thing to death\!"

Then, he took a few steps back.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly rushed out from the grass at the side. It jumped and pushed the little girl, who was about to fall to the ground, away. Then, it grabbed the belt at her waist and landed lightly on the ground.

The little girl landed on the ground, and her legs turned limp. She sat on the ground and raised her head, looking at Chu Xiaoye on the tree with tears in her eyes.

Catherine stood beside her motionless.

Little Curly Tail did not see the wonderful scene of the little girl being smashed to death. He immediately glared at Catherine angrily and bared his teeth, complaining that she was being nosy. His brother was about to fall to death that little thing, but you actually still wanted to save her. Aren't you his most loyal licker? Why did you suddenly stop licking?

Little Curly Tail raised his head and immediately complained to his brother that Catherine had a change of heart.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and slapped him, causing him to fall to the ground.

Little Curly Tail lay on the ground with tears in his eyes as he looked at the little girl. He could not understand why his brother wanted to hit him again. What did he do wrong again?

Mei Mei rolled her eyes at the side in disdain. "Idiot\!"

Night fell.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the water buffaloes outside the bushes and decided to borrow something from them tonight.

The pride had not eaten for a few days and had to eat tonight. Otherwise, they could not maintain sufficient strength and full spirit.

There were so many members of the water buffaloes. It was not overboard to borrow a few to eat, right?

They eat their grass and we'll eat our meat. It was very fair\!
