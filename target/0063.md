Chapter 63: Winner

"Roar\!”

The injured Maya looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was being pressed down by the wandering lion and had his neck bitten. She let out a sorrowful cry.

On the Baobab tree.

Catherine trembled and almost lost her balance.

Under the tree.

Little Curly Tail's eyes turned red. He suddenly roared and pounced at the wandering lion\!

Mei Mei bared her fangs and followed closely\!

Their intense sorrow and anger finally defeated their fear of the wandering lion\!

But.

Just as they pounced close, the huge wandering lion that was biting their brother's neck suddenly tilted and fell to the ground, its entire body twitching violently.

A terrifying wound actually appeared on the abdomen of this wandering lion, and it almost cut open his entire abdomen\!

Blood and internal organs gushed out and dyed his brother's body red\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately froze in place. They widened their eyes and stared blankly at this unbelievable scene, not moving.

Beside her, Maya suddenly stood up, her body trembling slightly. Her gaze was shocked, as if she could not believe it.

Chu Xiaoye was covered in blood as he got up from under the wandering lion with great difficulty. There was a burning pain on his neck and shoulder.

He looked at the opened stomach of the wandering lion, then raised his right claw to take a look.

The sharp tip of his right claw was actually flickering with a faint golden light.

Looking carefully, the tip of the claw had turned golden at some point in time, as if it was plated with a layer of golden light. Under the bright moonlight, it was shining with a charming luster\!

He was stunned for a moment before he raised his left claw again.

His left claw was still the same.

It seemed that only his right claw had changed.

He looked at the wandering lion that was still alive again. Thinking of the dangerous situation just now, he still had a lingering fear.

He was only a few seconds away from dying.

If he were given another chance to make a decision, he would probably start to hesitate about whether to save Maya or not.

It was really not easy to survive.

He really did not want to die.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei ran over excitedly. They stuck out their tongues and started to lick the blood and wounds on his body.

Their admiration and respect for their brother had almost reached an extreme height at this moment\!

Not only was his brother not killed by this fierce wandering lion, he even killed him and cut open this wandering lion's stomach\!

At this moment, they only wanted to say to their brother, "Brother is awesome\!\!\!"

On the Baobab tree.

Catherine stood on a branch and stared blankly at the figure that was covered in blood but still standing steadily. She could not help but pee\!

She was too happy and excited\!

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws to cleanse the filth on his abdomen and looked at the wandering lion lying on the ground again.

The wandering lion was already on the verge of death. It had no strength left and could not even roar.

He tilted his head and looked blankly at the blood and organs all over the ground, seemingly confused.

Finally, he looked at the cub in front of him.

Chu Xiaoye could not see the emotions in his eyes, but he could tell that he was filled with fear and despair.

Perhaps he would never understand why he died under the claws of a cub.

Of course, he was not the only one who did not understand. Even Chu Xiaoye himself could not understand.

The wandering lion looked at him for the last time. Then, it slowly lowered its head and opened its eyes, dying with a grievance.

Chu Xiaoye was not pleased with himself because of his victory, nor did he think that he was already invincible.

He had learned a deep lesson.

Human nature was extremely dangerous here.

If he wanted to survive here, he had to remember that he was a lion now, and a cub that was still underage\!

Before he was completely strong, he must not provoke an adult lion or any creatures he did not know.

Perhaps a poisonous bee, a cobra, or a bright flower could be fatal.

He had once seen the records. A female lion and three young cubs were all poisoned to death by the venom spewed out by a very small cobra.

Even at the top of the food chain on this grassland, they had to be constantly on guard against those unknown dangers.

Furthermore, the most powerful ruler of Earth had yet to appear.

Therefore, no matter when, never think that you are invincible and can defeat everything.

If he was too confident, he would die faster\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei eagerly licked the blood and dirt off his body.

As for the wounds on his neck and shoulder, he could only rely on himself.

Fortunately, his self-healing ability was extraordinary.

He endured the pain and walked to the bushes at the side and lay down.

He needed to rest.

During this period of time, he could not go to the back to hunt. For the time being, he could only be a lazy lion that ate, slept, and ate.

He hoped that nothing would happen to the pride during this period of time.

"Roar\!”

A lion's roar suddenly came from the grassland not far away.

Before long, the huge and strong figure of the cold father ran back majestically under the moonlight.

He smelled the scent of an enemy\!

It was the wandering lion that he had chased out of the territory in the evening\!

But.

When he ran into the camp angrily, he suddenly saw that the enemy, who was as strong as him, had already been cut open miserably and was lying on the ground dead\!

The cold father immediately shivered and felt a little terrified.

Who was it?

Who did it?

Who could open the stomach of this wandering lion?

Could it be the Seno brothers next door?

He was terrified\!

He walked to the side of the wandering lion and reached out with his claws to turn the corpse over. He looked carefully at the terrifying wound on his abdomen, his eyes filled with fear.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a few figures suddenly jumped out from the bushes at the back. They frightened the cold father, who was staring blankly at the wandering lion, and he almost fled\!

"Roar\!”

Aisha and the others had returned.

A strong smell of blood filled the grass.

They saw the dead wandering lion on the ground and were stunned at first. Then, they looked at the king, who was standing beside the corpse.

Callie and Lars, who had escaped, also came out of the bushes.

When they saw that the ferocious wandering lion had already died tragically, they were first stunned. Then, they hurriedly ran to the cold father's side in excitement and started to extend their tongues in a fawning manner to help him comb his fur.

The cold father stood beside the corpse of the wandering lion, motionless.

The injured Maya crawled on the ground and stared blankly at the figure sleeping in the bushes not far away.

On the Baobab tree.

Catherine never looked away.

Be it the lion, the cold father, or the lionesses who returned later, none of them could attract her attention.

At this moment, she only had eyes for him.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei walked to the bushes not far from their brother and lay down. They looked coldly at the pride who was celebrating their victory and fawning on the lion.

They did not want to disturb their brother or associate with those idiots.

A group of idiots\!

Including their mothers\!

They were all idiots\!
