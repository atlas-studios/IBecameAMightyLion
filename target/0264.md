Chapter 264: Giant Mosquito

"Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly fell onto a soft body\!

The bottom of the pit was not deep.

He hurriedly stepped on the soft body and jumped up.

The figure at the bottom of the pit seemed to be shocked as well. It immediately jumped up and stood opposite him, baring its fangs at him and letting out a fierce roar.

This was a young black female cub\!

Looking at him, he was at most a year old. Even his deliberately fierce cries seemed so childish.

Mei Mei immediately ran over and bared her fangs.

Little Curly Tail roared angrily. Just as he was about to pounce on it, he suddenly realized that something was wrong.

The fur on the little lioness's body was only black on the surface. The inside and roots were light brown.

That layer of black was not filled with luster like those black lions previously. It was very natural and seemed to be dyed. Furthermore, it was dyed with a very inferior dye. It looked dirty and ugly.

At this moment, this young female cub also bared her fangs and looked at him coldly, preparing to retaliate.

Little Curly Tail looked down at the pit under his feet.

This pit should have been dug by another animal and then used by this female cub as a hole to hide in. It was a little wider, but this female cub had no experience in digging pits and kept digging from the inside. Therefore, when Little Curly Tail stepped on it, it collapsed.

Mei Mei also seemed to have realized that this female cub was not one of the black lions' accomplices.

She put away her claws and sharp teeth and asked.

This young female cub still did not let down her guard. She slowly retreated under a big tree and suddenly turned around. With a whoosh, she climbed up the tree.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei looked shocked when they saw this scene.

This female cub also knew how to climb trees?

The young female cub stood on a branch and looked down at them. She bared her fangs and her cold gaze was filled with provocation.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail immediately rushed under the tree, jumped up, and instantly crawled to her side, looking at her disdainfully.

"Do you think you're the only one who knows how to climb trees?"

The young lioness was clearly stunned. She looked at him in a daze, not knowing what to do.

Mei Mei also climbed up agilely and continued to scream at her, asking her where she came from and why she was hiding here. What was with the black color on her body?

The female cub looked at her and slowly lowered her head.

At the same time.

On the grassland more than ten kilometers away, Chu Xiaoye finally caught up to the black lion with Catherine and Tilly and surrounded him.

The black lion's speed and endurance shocked the three of them.

Therefore, they did not dare to be careless at all.

Catherine immediately revealed her silver claws and pounced forward.

Tilly also let out her golden claws and jumped up.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and did not move, staring intently at the black lion.

When Tilly jumped up and the black lion looked below Tilly, Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed behind her with a whoosh.

At this moment, when Catherine and Tilly pounced on it at lightning speed, the black lion that was trying to escape in another direction indeed turned around and jumped out from under Catherine\!

"Bang\!"

However, just as he jumped out, he suffered a fierce slap from Chu Xiaoye\!

Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the head, causing him to tilt his head and fall to the ground.

However, just as he fell to the ground, he rolled out and suddenly jumped up, breaking out of the encirclement\!

Just as he was about to continue running quickly, Chu Xiaoye had already pounced on him. With a whoosh, he pierced his claws into the ribs on his back and pulled him back\!

"Roar—"

The black lion immediately roared angrily and turned around to bite him\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly swung his claws and threw him out with a whoosh, in the direction Tilly and Catherine were running towards\!

"Whoosh\!"

Before he could land on the ground, Tilly and Catherine passed by him at lightning speed\!

Tilly's golden claw cut off his entire spine\!

Catherine's silver claw broke open his entire abdomen\!

The black lion fell heavily to the ground with a splash of blood. Its body struggled violently a few times and it could not get up again.

However, he still did not stop breathing immediately. He turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye and the others with hatred, letting out an angry and unwilling roar.

When Chu Xiaoye walked in front of him, his vision finally turned black and he died completely.

On his back, his flesh was flipped open and his spine was neatly cut in half. Blood and internal organs surged out of his abdomen.

Chu Xiaoye waited for a while before stretching out his claws and flipping open his corpse. Indeed, he discovered a row of numbers on the inner side of his hind leg\!

"Bang\!"

Just as he was about to observe carefully, a gunshot suddenly came from the grassland not far away\!

Then, more gunshots sounded.

At the same time, the panicked cries of humans and the rumbling of cars could be heard\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly growled and left with Catherine and Tilly at his fastest speed. He did not even have the courage to look back.

As a human in the past, he knew best how terrifying humans were.

After they left in a hurry, a green pickup truck suddenly ran over from the distant grassland. The front of the truck swayed quickly and slithered like a snake. Terrified cries and crackling gunshots came from the car\!

"Boom\!"

Then, the green pickup suddenly turned around and fell to the ground.

The car door opened and a few figures screamed as they climbed out. They raised the guns in their hands and started fighting in the sky. As they fought, they ran.

However, soon, they fell to the ground and rolled violently, letting out terrified and miserable cries.

A group of huge mosquitoes landed on them, and their sharp mouths pierced into their skin.

Soon, the bodies of the few humans withered. In the blink of an eye, they became a few dried corpses.

As for the mosquitos that were previously the size of sparrows, their bodies suddenly swelled up and they quickly grew larger, like eagles.

They quickly flew into the sky and flew into the distance.

A vulture was circling in the sky, looking for rotten meat on the grassland.

When the huge mosquitoes flew past it, it instantly turned into a dried corpse and fell vertically from the sky.

When Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Tilly back to the bushes, he saw Mei Mei licking and tidying the fur on an unfamiliar female cub.

Only the back half of the lioness cub's fur was black.

Mei Mei decided to lick all the black.

This was true dyeing hair.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment, not knowing where this lioness cub came from.

When Mei Mei saw him return, she immediately ran in front of him and rubbed his head, looking at him fawningly.

"Brother, I picked up a female cub. She's so pitiful. Her parents and family were killed by those black lions. She's the only one who survived. Can we bring her along?"

Before Chu Xiaoye could answer, Little Curly Tail immediately growled, indicating that he could not.

"This female cub looks dirty. She might be sick and implicate us\!"

The female cub turned around and glared at him fiercely.

Little Curly Tail did not back down and also glared at her fiercely. He swung his tail behind him, looking like a ruffian who was looking down on him and did not want him.

Mei Mei ran over angrily and pushed him with her head, telling him to go away and not talk nonsense.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to let them quarrel over a female cub. He did not know if those humans would chase after them. This team might have all casualties at any time.

Therefore, he had to leave quickly with the team.

"Roar—"

He roared and told them to shut up. He immediately climbed up the tree and brought the mothers down.

As for this unfamiliar lioness cub, if she could follow the team, he would let her follow. If she could not, she could only blame herself for not having the ability to survive.

A female cub alone could not survive on the grassland without the protection of the pride.

If she wanted to continue living, she could only follow them with all her might.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and immediately set off.

Along the way, they saw many lion corpses again. There were lions, female lions, and young cubs. They were all lions on this grassland.

The black lions seemed to have already swept through the entire grassland.

In the evening, they came to the river and prepared to drink water.

After traveling continuously, not to mention the members of the pride of the cold father, even the mixed fur members were exhausted.

The temperature on this grassland was high to begin with. Even though it was the rainy season, the sun during the day was still very vicious.

For a lion, walking for a long time was already unbearable, let alone running.

Seeing that everyone was uncomfortably hot, Chu Xiaoye could only stop advancing for the time being. He found a safe shallow water area and let everyone go down to take a bath to cool down.

The six strong lions were all injured, especially mixed fur and blue eyes. After being slapped by the black lion, their heads were still dizzy and they needed to rest.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and personally guarded the innermost river, guarding against the sneak attack of the underwater crocodiles.

Everyone lay in the shallow water, breathing heavily and lazy to move.

Mei Mei brought the newly joined lioness cub, Molly, and rolled in the mud at the far side. Then, she walked into the deep water to wash.

Soon, the black color on Molly's body was washed away and she became a female cub with brown fur again.

Little Curly Tail seemed to have a lot of opinions about this female cub. Perhaps he had lost face in front of her after falling into the pit previously. Seeing that she had washed her fur, he immediately roared with laughter.

"Sister, your hair dye isn't good. It's gone after a random wash. You bought it with Xixi, right? Look at my brother. This is an authentic hair dye. It's like the real thing\!"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her and climbed into the water.

It turned out that this kid also thought that the circle of golden fur on his neck was deliberately dyed\!

Was he that bored?

Although some humans did like to dye their hair and wear golden chains around their necks, they were people who liked to show off in a high profile manner. Was he that kind of person?

He was neither that kind of person nor that kind of lion\!

Little Curly Tail got up from the water and looked at his brother in grievance and confusion. He did not understand what he had said wrong. He was clearly sucking up to him.

Chu Xiaoye glared at him, then looked at Mei Mei. He raised his claws and pointed at the circle of golden fur on his neck, asking her to comment and see if he was telling the truth.

Mei Mei immediately ran over eagerly and leaned close. She stared at it carefully for a while before crying out, "Of course it's true. Brother dyed it more real than real\!"

As he spoke, he quietly went behind him. Just as he reached out with his head, Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his hind leg and kicked her face with a bang, causing her to climb into the water.

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail, who had been feeling wronged and depressed just now, jumped around excitedly.

He liked to see his brother beating Mei Mei up\!

This girl had snatched his brother's love from him since she was young. He should beat her up\!

Mei Mei got up from the water and glared at him. She could not be bothered to bicker with him. She called out to Chu Xiaoye in grievance, indicating that she did not want to lick her brother's butt at all. Her brother had misunderstood her.

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes at this girl's attempt to hide something and ignored her.

Lars lay in the shallow water not far away, watching the intimate relationship of the three siblings in a daze. He could not help but think of his childhood.

The evening sun dyed half the sky and the river red.

This team that had been running all the way could finally lie here quietly. As they rested, they admired the beautiful scenery of the grassland.

When some animals on the grassland came to the river and prepared to drink water, they realized that the river was already occupied by a group of terrifying lions. They could only go upstream or downstream.

When Chu Xiaoye was lying in the river and squinting his eyes, he suddenly realized that a few black things were floating on the river not far away.

From afar, they looked like pieces of wood.

However, how could a lump of wood go against the current?

The animals on the grassland had mutated and become smarter. It was probably even more difficult for these crocodiles to disguise and ambush in the water than in the past.

However, they were one of the oldest animals. They were creatures left behind from the dinosaur era and had reproduced until now. Naturally, they had their own way of survival.

Of course, it was also possible that in this mutated species, their positions at the top of the food chain in the grassland would be changed.

Not every creature could always change with the world. Countless creatures disappeared in the long river of history.

When the few crocodiles popped their heads and slowly sneaked over, Little Curly Tail was immediately excited.

However, when they swam close, Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that something was wrong.

These crocodiles seemed to be a little terrifying\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail could not help but roar angrily and take the initiative to charge forward\!
