Chapter 375: Untitled

"Whoosh —"

The smell was blown away by the wind and drifted into the distance.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the group of giant water buffaloes outside the bushes. He thought for a moment and decided to forget it. It was too risky.

If they completely angered this group of giant water buffaloes, they would risk everything and destroy indiscriminately. If they all rushed into this forest, they would be doomed.

With the other party's current size, strength, and huge numbers, the bushes and trees here would probably be flattened.

At that time, the pride would have nowhere to hide or jump. They could only escape from this place. Those who were slow, such as the pit, Little Mi, Qiqi, and Nunu, would be trampled into meat paste by those terrifying iron hooves.

It was better to wait patiently and plan slowly.

"It's so smelly…"

Although the smelly fart had been blown away by the wind, the little girl still covered her nose and said faintly. No one knew if she really smelled it or if she only saw black smoke.

"It smells so bad… Smell more then."

Chu Xiaoye turned around and aimed his butt at her to scare her.

The little girl giggled and pounced over, pouncing on his back and hugging his neck tightly.

Chu Xiaoye's claws grabbed the branch steadily, and his heart trembled.

It seemed that the little girl felt that his neck and body were safer than the tree trunk she had just hugged.

She pounced over without hesitation. Wasn't she afraid that she would lose her balance and fall to her death?

This seemed to be a blind trust.

Just like how Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei trusted him.

However, this was not a good thing for Chu Xiaoye. It was a burden.

He hated burdens.

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly jumped into the air and jumped towards another big tree in the distance.

The night wind whistled in his ears. The hat at the back and the gazelle tail at the bottom were swaying left and right. His golden hair fluttered gently. The little girl widened her eyes and hugged his neck tightly, letting out a scream.

Chu Xiaoye landed steadily on the tree and turned around. He originally thought that this little girl would cry in fear. Unexpectedly, this little girl was so excited that her face was red and her beautiful eyes were shining. She said loudly, "I want more\! I want more\!"

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched and he jumped up again with a whoosh.

This time, he used a jet jump and sprayed air behind him. He jumped very high and flew very far.

He did not believe that he could not scare this little girl to tears\!

"Hahaha… you're flying\! You're flying\! Bad king, you're so powerful\! Higher, higher\! Let's fly into the sky\!"

"..."

The little girl hugged his neck tightly with her arms and legs wrapped around his body. She laughed excitedly and called out. She was extremely happy\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the tree and did not continue to jump. Instead, he jumped back to the Baobab tree, turned around, and threw her down roughly.

The little girl sat on the branch, but her arms were still tightly wrapped around his neck and she did not let go.

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and glared at her. He bared his fangs at her and pretended to be fierce, preparing to bite her.

However, this appearance made the little girl laugh.

The little girl even freed up a small hand and pinched his nose. She used her finger to poke his bared fangs and said sweetly, "Bad king, you're so cute."

Chu Xiaoye breathed heavily. He was furious\!

He let out a low growl and decided to teach this little girl a lesson\! He had to let her know who was the boss here\! He had to let her know that the dignity of a lion king was inviolable\! He had to let her know that any organ on a lion king was not to be played with\!

Just as he raised his claws and was about to use force, the little girl suddenly climbed onto his back again. She bent down and buried her face in his golden mane. She rubbed it gently and said softly, "Bad king, thank you. Thank you for saving me, thank you for protecting me, thank you for giving me warmth, thank you for making me happy… Thank you…"

The night wind was gentle and brushed past his heart.

The white dress hanging on the bushes under the tree was bathed in the bright moonlight, like a white lotus blooming in the night, pure and beautiful.

Chu Xiaoye looked on in a daze. He slowly put away his bared fangs. The ferocity in his eyes could not help but quietly retreat and become gentle.

At this moment, the little girl lying on his back suddenly grabbed his golden mane with her two small hands and giggled. "So, Annie wants to braid a few braids for you and make you as cute as Annie\!"

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye's fangs were revealed again\!

She was bullying him too much\!

Under the tree, the members of the pride raised their heads and looked strangely at the scene of the man and lion playing on the tree. They were shocked and could not understand.

When did their king become so good-tempered?

Especially Little Curly Tail, who was always slapped by his brother. When he saw that his brother was bullied by that little thing but did not slap that little thing, he was puzzled and jealous.

His brother had changed.

Did he have a change of heart or did he become gentle?

Little Curly Tail could not guess.

The cold father rolled his eyes and looked at him coldly.

At this time, strong enemies were surrounding the outside, the territory was occupied, and the door was blocked. Everyone was terrified. This unfilial son actually had the mood to play with that strange little thing? He was a lion king in vain\!

Catherine stood silently in the shadows of the trees like a loyal guard, ignoring everything her master did.

Tilly was still lying on another Baobab tree, sleeping. Occasionally, she would open her eyes and look at them, but she did not have any expression. Soon, she fell asleep again.

She was very tired and wanted to sleep. Furthermore, her body felt a little cold.

In an environment as cold as the snow mountain, she would not feel cold. She even often sneaked into the sea under the ice to fish and eat. Why would she feel cold at this time?

She fell asleep in a daze and could not think so much.

Of course, she would never have thought that the soft and snow-white fur on her body had been removed by Chu Xiaoye and used to make a bed for the little girl.

She was naked.

However, even softer and more exquisite snow-white fur with a luster quickly grew out of her pores.

Not only her, everything on the grassland seemed to be quietly changing.

The night quickly passed.

At dawn, they split into two groups of water buffaloes and started to change shifts.

Those standing guard went to eat grass, and those who ate grass came to stand guard.

Although the water buffaloes had become even larger than before, the amount of food and foraging time they needed were many times more than before.

They had to eat grass non-stop to maintain their body's needs. In the past, they might only need to eat grass for eight to nine hours a day. Now, they had to eat at least 17 to 18 hours a day.

Their huge bodies made them stronger. Of course, it also became their burden.

Fortunately, there was plenty of grass on this grassland. Furthermore, because of the blood rain, the production speed was very fast and lush.

When the two groups of water buffaloes changed shifts, a roar suddenly sounded from the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers and suddenly rushed out of the bushes.

This might be a good opportunity to create chaos.

The water buffaloes that had been guarding the bushes were still hungry. Now, they were anxious to split up and eat grass. They no longer had the fighting spirit to charge forward bravely.

The increase in intelligence and the dignity of the leading cows made them line up neatly last night and always followed orders. They stayed in place dutifully, blocking the bushes and preparing to welcome the impact of the pride. They did not even dare to eat the surrounding grass.

Therefore, they were very hungry and anxious.

This gave Chu Xiaoye a chance to suddenly attack.

However, for safety reasons, Chu Xiaoye only brought the most agile few. When he encountered danger, he would not fall into those terrifying hooves and be unable to escape.

Chu Xiaoye was quick as lightning and rushed out first. He pounced at the water buffalo that had turned around and was preparing to leave.

However, the water buffalo was very vigilant. It swung its tail and suddenly raised its thick hooves, kicking up heavily. At the same time, the sharp horns of a water buffalo beside it suddenly pierced over.

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart, but he did not retreat. He still pounced forward and raised his golden claw. With a whoosh, he actually cut off the two incoming horns and the hooves\!

"Moo—"

The water buffaloes were furious. They turned around and rushed over ferociously\!

Seeing that they were still in a neat formation and had a fierce aura, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate. He immediately turned around, roared, and fled back to the bushes with the team.

The hooves were like thunder, the ground trembled, and killing intent surged\!

At this moment, he could only dodge.

Before Little Curly Tail and the others could fight, they could only turn around and return, fleeing miserably into the bushes.

The other party's size and formation were too big. To them, it was a complete suppression. Even if they could ignore the danger and kill a few, they would definitely be trampled into meat paste.

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the Baobab tree and stood beside the little girl, staring nervously at the angry water buffaloes outside the bushes.

Fortunately, the other party stopped in his tracks and did not rush in again.

Yesterday, he had hoped that this group of water buffaloes could rush in. This way, they would have a chance to kill each other. Today, he hoped that the other party would hold back and not be too rash.

From the other party's current unity and charging formation, even if the other party charged ferociously into the bushes, they would never split up, let alone run around and mess up the formation.

With the other party's size and strength, at that time, these bushes and trees would definitely not be able to withstand it and fall to the ground.

At that time, it would be their most miserable and dangerous time.

Fortunately, the water buffaloes did not seem to want to take the risk. They also seemed to have suffered from breaking into the bushes. They kept a respectful distance from the bushes and did not dare to enter easily.

Sometimes, an increase in intelligence was not a good thing. It would only make his former courage or rashness timid and cautious.

If he thought too much, he would lose more chances.

Seeing the water buffaloes flaunting their might outside the bushes but not daring to enter, Chu Xiaoye pretended to roar and let the other party in.

Little Curly Tail immediately roared as well. He even bared his fangs and pretended to pounce forward, looking impatient.

This kid really wanted to let the water buffaloes in so that he could kill those water buffaloes with ease like before.

The other members of the pride also roared and hooted at the water buffaloes, letting them enter to fight to the death.

Only Catherine and Blue Eyes were calmer and knew Chu Xiaoye's true intentions. Or, they could tell that this king was guilty.

This group of giant water buffaloes was not the water buffaloes of the past. They could not be anxious.

The water buffaloes started to change shifts.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and walked out of the bushes with Little Curly Tail and the others. He continued to roar and looked like he was preparing to rush out.

The hungry water buffaloes were shocked and furious. They could only retreat carefully and walk out.

After all the water buffaloes changed shifts, Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and returned with the team.

The water buffalo with its hooves cut off limped into the distance. It was concentrating on eating grass and soon forgot the pain.

It seemed that the bodies of these water buffaloes had also improved greatly.

Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail and the others continue to guard here. He brought Mei Mei and walked towards the river at the bushes.

Catherine had to stay here and protect the little girl. Although he did not instruct her like this, Catherine could understand what he meant very cleverly.

Although he was the only one Catherine wanted to protect.

After leaving the bushes, there was only a small grassland outside and the wide river ahead.

In the past, at this time, many herbivores would gather on this grassland to eat grass. But today, looking around, it was empty without a single animal.

It seemed that the murderous aura of this group of water buffaloes was really powerful.

A cow ate grass and a lion ate meat.

If he wanted to win the battle and reclaim the territory occupied by the water buffaloes, he had to eat his fill first.

Then, what else could he eat other than buffalo meat?

The amount of food a pride needed was not a small number.

Chu Xiaoye brought Mei Mei to the river and looked down at the river water under his feet.

He prepared to catch crocodiles to eat.

The current crocodiles had all become giant crocodiles. Every one of them was five meters long and weighed 1.5 tons. Although the meat was not too delicious for lions, it was enough to fill their stomachs.

He followed the river and searched carefully.

However, the strange thing was that after walking for a long distance, Chu Xiaoye and Mei Mei did not find any trace of the crocodile.

He did not even see one.

Chu Xiaoye thought that it was just an accident last night and that the crocodiles might be resting in the water. Now, he realized that the situation seemed to be wrong.

Where did all those crocodiles go? Could they have migrated to another river segment?

Chu Xiaoye stopped by the river and thought for a while. He turned around and instructed Mei Mei. Then, with a splash, he jumped into the river and sank.

Mei Mei stood on the shore and looked anxiously at the river. He had long disappeared.

"Croak—Croak—"

A group of crows suddenly flew over her head and let out ear-piercing noise.

Mei Mei was shocked. She looked up and saw crows flying past. In the blue sky, a huge white snow eagle suddenly appeared and slowly landed like a white cloud.
