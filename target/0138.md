Chapter 138: Two Followers

A lion riding an elephant?

The noisy river instantly quietened down.

All the animals seemed to be in a daze.

The two thin wandering lions standing on the hill widened their eyes and looked at this magical and absurd scene in disbelief.

That young fellow was actually riding on the back of an elephant\!

Did they see wrongly?

Was this the life of a rich lion who rode around on food and took a bite when he was hungry?

Their eyes turned red with envy\!

Jealousy made them look completely different\!

They had not eaten their fill for months.

Over this period of time, they had been spending their days rotting meat.

If this continued, they might not even have the strength to snatch the rotten meat.

They were facing the cruel fate of being starved to death.

However, this young fellow actually rode such a big piece of fresh meat around. He could lower his head and eat his fill at any time\!

They were all lions, so why was the difference so big?

They were unwilling to accept this\!

Hence, they roared angrily and rushed down the hill.

The herbivores by the river immediately fled in panic. Before leaving, they did not forget to look back at the strange lion riding on the elephant.

They stopped not far away and continued to watch curiously.

This was a spectacle they had never seen before\!

When the two wandering lions went down the slope, their feet suddenly turned limp and they rolled down, stopping in front of the small elephant.

They immediately got up from the ground and looked at the small elephant in a sorry state and the young fellow on its back in shame.

"Roar—"

Their roars were still filled with the dignity of a lion\!

They bared their fangs and challenged the young lion on the elephant's back\!

As long as they defeated him, this small elephant would be theirs\!

They could also ride on the backs of elephants and flaunt their might to restore the might of the lion. Then, like a rich lion, they could stroll around and make their own kind envious to death. At the same time, when they were hungry, they could eat meat and drink blood\!

This was the happy life a lion should have\!

However, the kid riding on the elephant did not look at them at all. Instead, he raised his head and looked at the black antelopes in front of him.

He was looking down on and humiliating them\!

They could not tolerate it\!

"Roar—"

They roared again, bared their fangs, and prepared to pounce on him\!

Right at this moment, the kid riding on the elephant suddenly became like a bolt of lightning. With a whoosh, he jumped down from the elephant's back and shot towards the few black antelopes in front of him\!

"Smack\! Smack\!"

Two crisp sounds\!

He raised his palm and the two black antelopes fell to the ground.

The other black antelopes finally reacted and fled in panic\!

The young male lion bit a black antelope and turned around to return. He jumped gently and jumped onto the elephant's back again, placing the black antelope on it.

However, he jumped down again and picked up another black antelope, placing it on the elephant's back.

He rode on the elephant and bit the throat of a black antelope as he drank its blood and ate its meat. He slapped the elephant's back with his claws.

From the beginning to the end, he did not look at them.

The little elephant carried him, swung its nose and wagged its tail, and left leisurely.

Two adult lions that were baring their fangs opened their mouths and stood frozen in place. They stared and did not dare to move.

The other carnivores that were wandering not far in front of them and preparing to take a share of the food instantly dispersed and hurriedly made way.

The herbivores that were blocking the front and preparing to line up to drink water also fled in fear.

The previously crowded and noisy river immediately opened up a wide path and became strangely quiet.

The young male cub rode on the elephant and came leisurely before leaving.

Along the way, he also brought away two strong black antelopes.

Looking at his back as he rode on the elephant and ate the black antelope as if it was nothing, all the animals by the river froze in place, looking like stone sculptures.

The river stopped flowing.

Every few meters, a muddy pool of dead water would appear.

Beside every pool, animals rushing over to drink water were gathered.

Every animal was struggling to survive.

When a young cub appeared leisurely in their vision while riding a small elephant and eating fresh meat, these animals that were struggling at the edge of life and death were shocked.

They tacitly and automatically made way.

A few hungry wild dogs could not help but want to provoke him, but they were instantly sent flying by the cub that jumped down from the elephant's back.

This terrifying scene made the other eager carnivores immediately quieten down.

This was a scene that all animals would never forget for their lives\!

The endurance of the little elephant was extraordinary.

Until the sky turned dark, it still walked with ease in the night.

Chu Xiaoye ate two entire black antelopes.

He did not like to eat internal organs, things above the neck, and things behind the butt. Therefore, he threw away a lot of flesh along the way.

When he directed the little elephant up the hill and prepared to find a place to rest, he realized that not far behind them were two wandering lions.

They were the two thin and weak lions that had previously provoked him but whose limbs had turned limp from hunger.

They followed and ate the entire way. They were so happy that they were about to roar.

No wonder he avoided the carnivores he encountered along the way and they did not dare to provoke him at all.

Chu Xiaoye thought that his deterrence as a future lion king had been revealed in advance.

However, he did not expect to use the might of these two fellows.

Although they were already famished and useless, their lush manes were still a symbol of strength.

Chu Xiaoye only turned around to look at them, but he scared them quite a bit. They immediately stopped in place, their eyes filled with fear, but they could not bear to leave.

In their current situation, they could not hunt anymore.

The prey that could survive until now in the dry season were all smarter and stronger than the other.

They had already despaired.

However, just now, their desire and hope for life were reignited.

They only needed to follow behind to eat fresh meat. They did not need to expend any energy. If they could do this every day, their bodies would slowly recover and become stronger again.

Then, they could survive again.

Therefore, although they were afraid, they were unwilling to leave.

This was their only chance of survival\!

They decided to follow this young and powerful lion until they recovered and became majestic lions again.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and directed the little elephant to walk to the grassland. He looked around, looking for a place to rest.

Soon, he discovered a small patch of bushes.

The bushes were still green and had lush leaves. They did not wither with the withered grassland.

The little elephant was clearly very excited as well and immediately quickened its steps.

It had been walking for a day and was hungry.

Not only could it help Chu Xiaoye find water to drink, but it could also be Chu Xiaoye's mount and transport food. It was very useful.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to spare its life for the time being.

When there was really no food to eat, he would eat it in one bite\!

The future lion king's words were true\!

The two thin and weak wandering lion brothers followed behind him timidly. They were neither too close nor too far away. Their eyes were filled with longing for survival and fear for him.

Chu Xiaoye rode on his elephant and just as he approached the bushes, there was a sudden roar from inside\!

Then, two strong lions walked out of the bushes with a group of female lions, their gazes cold and furious\!

However, when they saw this strange group, they were stunned.

What was going on???

A cub riding a little elephant?

The two wandering lions following behind Chu Xiaoye were terrified. They wanted to escape, but they could not bear to.

Stepping into the territory of this pride was equivalent to challenging the lion king here\!

As for the two adult lions, they were so strong and mighty that they had no chance of winning.

As for the cub riding on the elephant, although it was very strong, in front of these two strong adult lions, it was probably…

"Bang\!"

"Bang\!"

With two muffled sounds, the two strong adult lions tilted their heads and fell to the ground. They did not even see what was happening\!

The two wandering lions:"…"

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the two adult lions and slapped them twice more, causing them to faint.

Then, he brought the little elephant into the bushes under the dumbfounded gazes of the female lions.

"Roar\!"

"Roar\!"

Four five to six month old cubs suddenly ran out of a bush. When they saw him and the elephant, they were first stunned, but then they immediately bared their fangs and curled up, letting out trembling whimpers.

The female lions hurriedly ran over and looked at him in fear.

Usually, after a wandering lion defeated a lion king in the territory, it would bite these few-month-old cubs to death. Then, it would force the female lions to mate again and produce offspring.

Therefore, at this moment, these female lions were extremely terrified.

The two wandering lions not far away were excited and nervous.

This cub was so terrifyingly strong. If they followed him in the future, they would definitely be able to eat and drink well. However, if he occupied this place and became the king, would he chase them away?

They did not want to leave and starve to death again. They only hoped that this young male cub could give them a chance to bow down.

"Roar—"

They immediately roared angrily, bared their fangs, and walked towards the seven female lions and the four young cubs\!

Obviously, these seven female lions did not seem to be willing to yield\!

They decided to take the initiative to go forward and teach these blind idiots a lesson. They would kill those few little things easily\!

They had to perform well in front of this young lion and perform well\!
