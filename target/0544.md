Chapter 544: Lord Night's Wife

The Carter army stationed outside Bingluo City for three days.

During this time, Carter never walked out of the tent. Even when Mormont sent someone to deliver the promised gifts, she did not come out to take a look.  

The soldiers in the army discussed animatedly, but they did not dare to approach. They could only hear some news from the guards outside the tent.

It was said that some strange sounds would always be thought of in the tent. There were sounds of quarreling, cursing, fighting, and even the sound of leather whips and miserable cries. Occasionally, there would be the roar of lions.

"Sigh, I was envious and jealous of that kid in the beginning. Now, he's so pitiful."

"Yeah, I wonder how badly she was tortured by our queen. She'll probably be carried out when the time comes."

"With such a small body, he definitely can't withstand Her Majesty's rough abuse, right?"

The soldiers always whispered to each other and secretly discussed the situation inside. They expressed sympathy, but their faces were filled with schadenfreude. 

However, three days later, the young elf walked out of the tent unharmed.

Their queen shouted weakly in the tent, "My dear, I will wait for your triumphant return on the throne of the Holy City. If you dare not return, I will kill my way to the Elven Kingdom… and die for you to see\!"

The soldiers:"…"

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to delay and quickly walked out of the camp.

The moment he walked out of the camp, his legs suddenly turned limp and he knelt on the ground. He finally heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, after three days and three nights of hard work, he finally convinced the little demon to let him go with his actions.

"It's not easy\!" 

He sighed, stood up, and walked towards Bingluo City. He raised his head and stuck out his chest, his face filled with pride. He used an exaggerated expression to cover the humiliation and sadness in his heart.

"Look\! Lord Night is back\!"

Fei'er suddenly shouted from the city wall, her face filled with excitement. She waved at him with all her might and shouted, "Lord Night\! Lord Night\! You're finally back\! Her Majesty is crying because she missed you."

"Fei'er\! Shut up\!"

Lanisi reprimanded from above.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the beautiful girls standing on the city wall, but he was not excited at all. Instead, the shadow swayed and he felt lingering fear.

Mormont opened the city gate and welcomed him warmly.

Chu Xiaoye was originally afraid that a long night would cause trouble and prepared to leave today, but his body could not take it. Furthermore, this City Lord was very warm and insisted on setting up a banquet to treat them. It was said that there were still roasted whole sheep, roasted whole cows, and even raw meat at the banquet.

Chu Xiaoye could only swallow his saliva and agree.

When the dinner started, Mormont's little granddaughter, Doya, personally came to pour wine for him. Then, she stood behind him and served him like a maid. Seeing that his mouth was full of oil, she even personally wiped his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye ate and kept persuading her not to be so polite, but she was even more polite than before.

What was even more strange was that like Mormont, Lanisi and the others ignored them with meaningful smiles.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye realized that this old City Lord had something to ask of him.

Indeed, after three rounds of wine, Mormont picked up his wine glass and walked over. He said with a smile, "Night, I know where you're going this time and that you'll encounter many dangers on the way. Therefore, I've decided not only to lend you the fire dragon, I'll also give you something more useful to repay your kindness to this city."

Chu Xiaoye looked surprised and said awkwardly, "Don't you have something to ask me?"

Mormont smiled and said, "Of course not. I'm here to repay your kindness."

As he spoke, he looked at Doya, who was behind him, and said, "Doya, fill Lord Ye's cup."

Doya brought the wine pot forward and filled Chu Xiaoye's glass.

Mormont raised his glass and smiled. "Night, come, let's drink first."

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to drink it and looked at him vigilantly. "Lord Mormont, speak first."

He had an ominous feeling.

Mormont seemed to see through his worry and laughed. "Night, don't worry. I said that I'm here to repay your kindness, not to trouble you."

As he spoke, he pointed at Doya beside him and said meaningfully, "What do you think of my granddaughter?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he turned to look at the girl beside him and said in confusion, "Lord Mormont means…"

Lanisi, who was sitting beside him, suddenly said, "Night, Lord Mormont is asking you, how is Doya?"

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at her and saw that the Elven Queen had a faint smile on her face. She even blinked at him playfully. Clearly, she had already reached an agreement with Mormont during the three days he had been away.

Fei'er also grinned and said, "Lord Night, Miss Doya is very beautiful, gentle, and smart, right?"

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he suddenly thought of something.

The wine glass in his hand trembled and he hurriedly put down the wine glass. He waved at the old man in front of him and said, "No\! No\! Lord Mormont, I already have a wife, and I have more than one."

Alisa alone was enough to give him a headache and a kidney ache. If another one came, what would happen?

From Alisa's change, he could tell that although orc girls were slender and sexy, their physique was exceptionally strong and much more terrifying than that of a wild beast\!

Although this girl called Doya looked delicate and soft, she was an orc after all. The blood of an orc flowed in her bones. If she went crazy, she would definitely not be inferior to Alisa.

Furthermore, he did not like this girl at all. Back then, he only recalled her name.

"Lord Mormont, I appreciate your kindness. I'm short and small. I'm not worthy of the beautiful and noble Miss Doya."

Chu Xiaoye rejected him directly, not giving the old man any leeway or hope.

However, his words stunned the old man in front of him and he looked at him in shock. Lanisi and the others beside him were also stunned.

As for Doya, who was standing at the side, she widened her eyes and bit her lips, blushing.

"Lord Night, you… you're thinking too much…"

Fei'er said weakly and looked at him faintly.

Vilis, who was sitting beside Fei'er, sneered. "Pervert\! You're thinking too much\!"

Lanisi held in her laughter and explained, "Night, Lord Mormont means that we can let Doya come with us. Not only does Doya know the map of the Kingdom of Kast, she also knows the maps of other beast kingdoms and human empires, and she also knows the customs of the other countries. Also, we need Miss Doya to control the fire dragon. Without Miss Doya, we can't leave."

Mormont said with a smile, "Night, could it be that this is not what you want?"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

How embarrassing\!

He really wanted to find a hole to hide in.

At this moment, Lanisi suddenly narrowed her eyes and said, "Night, didn't you say at the beginning that you only have one wife? Why did you say just now that you have many more? Other than Princess Carter of the Danota family, who else is there?"

The best way to resolve the awkwardness was to shift the embarrassment to others and make their own jokes others' jokes.

"There's you\! There's also Fei'er, Vilis, Denise, and all the beautiful girls in your Elf Kingdom\!"

Chu Xiaoye said without blushing.

Hence, under everyone's shocked gazes, the Elven Queen blushed…

Fei'er blushed, but her eyes were bright and happy.

Vilis also blushed, but she glared with flames shooting out of her eyes.

Denise did not blush or even look at him.

"Oh, right. There's also Catherine."

Chu Xiaoye pointed at Catherine at the side.

Hence, Catherine also blushed. Although her face could not be seen, her lowered head, lowered eyelids, and open mouth all displayed the shyness and joy of a young girl.

See, everyone was embarrassed.

Chu Xiaoye picked up a lamb leg and gloated.
