Chapter 124: Untitled

"Roar\!"

The cold father suddenly roared angrily and walked in front of the two adult lions majestically. He looked down at them proudly.

It was as if he was saying, "You can't even defeat my sons, so are you worthy of being arrogant in front of me?"

The two adult lions' eyes were filled with fear. They hurriedly got up from the ground and ran away with the female lions.

Even though they were of the same species, they would also kill each other.

However, most would try their best to avoid casualties and run as much as possible.

If the victorious party was not too cruel, they would mostly let the other party go.

Little Curly Tail turned around and looked at his brother. He looked like he wanted to continue and was in high spirits.

As long as his brother looked at him, he would chase after them and kill them\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and looked at the fleeing pride with flickering eyes.

If not for the dry season and the lack of food, he would not mind taking in some lions to strengthen the pride of the cold father.

After all, many powerful creatures of unknown origins had already appeared on this grassland. Only by making the pride stronger could they have a greater chance of survival.

Unfortunately, it was difficult for even them to survive at this time, let alone a group of lions with astonishing appetite.

Even the powerful super prides would automatically split into several teams during this dry season when there was a lack of food and go out to live.

The key was to survive the dry season.

They had to continue looking for prey.

There were also prey during the dry season. They were all prey with extremely tenacious life force and had very little need for water.

However, they were not easy to find.

Until dawn, they did not find any prey.

The night's journey exhausted them.

After returning to the camp.

Maya immediately ran in front of the cave, pushed aside the branches that covered the hole, and called out to the hole.

Soon, two small, furry heads popped out.

The two young cubs were safe and sound.

On the other hand, the warthog lay limp on the branch and whimpered, seemingly terrified.

Little Curly Tail climbed up the tree and bit it down.

The cold father and the female lions' eyes immediately lit up and they drooled.

However, after what happened last night, they no longer dared to show off their seniority to these little fellows.

They started to be afraid.

Animals had a natural fear of the strong.

Lions were no exception.

The cold father turned his head and tried not to look at the wild boar.

He lay down in the shade of the bushes with his mouth open and let out a strange cry. He looked pitiful, like a lonely old man who did not have anything to eat or drink and whose children and grandchildren were unfilial.

Unfortunately, Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail ignored him.

If it were other prides, after the son became stronger than their father, they would directly expel him from the territory rudely and let him fend for himself.

Not only did they not know his limits, they even dared to pretend to be pitiful. They were asking for a yard after taking an inch.

Seeing that they were ignoring him, the cold father was a little worried.

He knew that from now on, he no longer had the strength to chase these two unfilial sons out.

At that time, he might be the one going out to wander.

The survival rate of wandering lions was extremely low, and there was a high chance that they would die. They would either starve to death or die in battle.

He did not want to die.

However, he, a dignified lion king, could not lower his status to please these two fellows who smelled like milk\!

He would rather die than submit\!

At that time, if these two unfilial sons really wanted to chase him away mercilessly, he would bang his head against the wall and end everything\!

At this moment, he thought of Lars, who he had cruelly chased away, and seemed to regret it.

Were father and son really going to be like enemies, heartlessly killing each other?

Why could they not get along peacefully?

The cold father realized that his thoughts seemed to be too active and abnormal recently.

The original him would not have thought so much.

Was it because he was gradually growing old?

The warthog, who had been frightened for the entire night, continued to dig holes in the back.

It worked even harder.

Chu Xiaoye did not care about his fatigue from running around for the night. He held his bow and let Catherine follow him to the bushes at the back.

He found a tree not far from the pit and asked Catherine to help him tie the bow vertically to the tree trunk.

After tying it tightly, he picked up a bag of arrows and took one out. In front of Catherine, he placed the arrow on the bowstring with his mouth.

Behind every arrow was a groove. As long as the arrow was stuck on the bowstring, he could pull the bowstring and shoot.

Even if he did not touch the arrow, as long as he pulled the string open, he could easily shoot it out.

To make up for the inconvenience of not shooting with his left hand, he even tied a small and straight branch in the middle of the bow.

In this way, the head of the arrow could be placed steadily on it.

However, since the bow could not be moved and the arrows were shot in the same direction, he had to find the most suitable position.

Now, Chu Xiaoye only wanted Catherine to practice archery first and find a position after she became proficient.

Catherine was very strong and had claws. She was most suitable for archery.

Chu Xiaoye made her stand in front of the bow and arrow, open her eyes, and look carefully.

He decided to practice it.

Although he did not have claws, he only needed to use the gap between his feet to hold the arrow.

Many people thought that one needed a thumb to press hard on the bowstring and arrow when shooting an arrow. Most archery methods did not require a thumb to use. In fact, they did not even need a thumb.

The most common way to shoot an arrow was to shoot in the Mediterranean style. He only needed to stick the tail of the arrow on the string and use his index finger, middle finger, and ring finger to gently hold the arrow. He did not need to use much strength.

Pulling the string was where he had to use strength.

The ancient Mongolian-style archery required the use of the thumb, but it was only clamped between the thumb and index finger. It was not like on television where one wrongly used the thumb to press on the string.

Therefore, a lion's feet could completely complete the action of shooting an arrow.

Chu Xiaoye raised his front right palm, using the gap in the middle to grab the arrow. He bent his right palm slightly and slowly pulled the bowstring back.

Catherine stood at the side and watched motionlessly.

She had never seen this thing and did not know what it was for.

However, she liked everything he liked.

She had to learn it\!

The sharp arrow aimed in the direction of the new trap.

The warthog was working hard to deepen the trap. Its head was full of thoughts of the dried corpses of its companions in the storage room from last night. They were dense and could not be shaken off, making it terrified.

It was too cruel\!

It was too terrifying\!

Why not flee?

It did not want to be dried up by the sun and piled there. It could not die in peace. It was so miserable\!

Just as its thoughts were wavering and it was thinking about whether to escape, it suddenly raised its head and looked at the big tree not far away.

Were the two cubs hiding there to monitor it?

Hmph\!

At such a distance, as long as I turned around and quickly crawled into the bushes at the side, no matter how fast they were, they could not catch up to me\!

"Whoosh\!‚Äù

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, something suddenly flew past him and pierced into a big tree behind him. Its tail trembled non-stop\!

Its speed was terrifying\!

It did not see what it was\!

When it turned its head and saw the thing that was deeply inserted into the tree trunk, its body trembled and it almost peed its pants. The thought of escaping in its heart instantly disappeared.

Little Curly Tail, who was sleeping not far away, immediately jumped up with a whoosh and looked at the still trembling arrow in fear\!

Catherine, who was standing beside Chu Xiaoye, was stunned by this magical and terrifying scene\!

A small branch-like thing could have such terrifying speed and lethality after this?

She turned around and looked at the figure beside her.
