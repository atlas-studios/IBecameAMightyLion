Chapter 462: The Lolita Who Requested To Battle

"Roar—"

Although the eight lions did not dare to move forward, they raised their heads and stuck out their chests, roaring as they revealed the expressions of victors. Furthermore, they stuck out their butts and started to pee on the ground. As they marked the borders of their territory, they warned Chu Xiaoye and the other outsiders.

"If you dare to barge in again, kill without mercy\!"

The thirty-over female lions also let out loud roars, as if they were cheering for their lions or mocking the group of invaders who were biting off more than they could chew.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at them. He measured the distance between the bushes and the border with his gaze. It was only a thousand meters.

Obviously, it was far from the territory he thought of.

Little Curly Tail's growl of invitation for battle sounded beside him. Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers also roared and requested to fight.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and deliberately provoked them. "No, they're so tall and strong that you can't defeat them. Why don't we take this little territory?"

Little Curly Tail immediately swung his tail and jumped up. He roared, "Brother\! Watch me twist their heads off\!"

Mixed Fur also roared angrily, "How do you know that you can't win if you haven't fought? This is only a small territory. There's no place to pee, let alone hunt\! Those fellows are just big and roar like wild cows. Why are you afraid of them\!"

Blue Eyes raised his head and squinted majestically. "King, I'm willing to fight\!"

The Jerry brothers had never had any objections and followed Chu Xiaoye. They did whatever Chu Xiaoye said. However, at this moment, the eyes of the two brothers were filled with fighting spirit.

They were not afraid of the eight giant lions.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Catherine and Alisa.

Catherine naturally listened to him. Even if he let her deal with the eight giant lions alone, she would rush up without hesitation, even if she would be torn to pieces.

As for Alisha…

The little lioness seemed to have seen through his thoughts. At this moment, she was squinting and looking at him mockingly.

They had gone through painstaking means to come here and finally found a suitable territory. How could they give up? Although the bushes were not small, it was far from enough for them. Furthermore, herbivores rarely came.

If the pride wanted to reproduce and strengthen, they naturally needed more territory.

Now that the opportunity and challenge were in front of them, if they retreated, it would only affect the fighting spirit and confidence of the pride.

Even she could understand, let alone this fellow.

Therefore, she was not in a hurry at all. She would let this fellow perform slowly.

"King\! Annie requests to fight\!"

Right at this moment, the human little girl riding on the big black bear suddenly raised her little fist and recommended herself to fight.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at her in shock.

Although the other members of the pride did not understand what this human girl was saying, after spending so much time together, they seemed to be able to figure out what she meant. At this moment, everyone could actually see her attitude.

From everyone's surprised gazes, they could tell that they suddenly had a whole new level of respect for this little girl who had been useless along the way.

At least, her courage was worth confirming.

"King\! Annie feels that we have to fight this battle well. Otherwise, your throne will be in danger. No one will respect and trust you. Those beautiful female lions will no longer like and admire you. Also, we need a territory filled with sunlight and grass, right?"

The little girl blinked her beautiful Blue Eyes and suddenly displayed maturity and intelligence that did not match her age.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in surprise, finding this little girl's courage and thoughts unbelievable.

"King\! If you don't dare, Annie will underestimate you too\!"

The little girl pouted and turned her eyes agilely. She actually returned the lion's body to him and started to provoke him.

Chu Xiaoye stared at her differently from before. Just as he was in a daze, the roars of the eight lions and the cheers of the thirty-over female lions came again.

"Scram\! Stay away from our territory\! If not, we'll tear your heads off\!"

After the eight lions finished peeing, marking and dividing the territory, they stood there, flaunting their might and roaring in unison.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his gaze from the little girl and looked at the eight lions. Then, he growled and walked over first.

The members of the pride immediately followed behind and roared in unison with high fighting spirit\!

"Roar—"

Seeing that they still dared to come over, the eight lions immediately bared their fangs and roared angrily. The female lions also bared their teeth and roared angrily from behind, revealing fierce expressions.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stopped and turned to look at the human little girl. His eyes flickered and he gestured for her to go first. "Weren't you asking to fight just now? Then, you'll be the first to go up and fight\!"

The other members of the pride also turned around and looked at the human girl.

The little girl was stunned for a moment and had a bitter expression, as if she regretted her words just now. She blinked her big blue eyes and looked at him pitifully. "King, if Annie is alone, they will tear her into pieces…"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her begging and pity and looked at her intently. "Go\!"

This was equivalent to a king's order. Those who did not listen would be chased out of the pride and left to fend for themselves\!

Seeing his unyielding attitude, the little girl did not dare to dawdle anymore. She pouted and lowered her head, looking like a pitiful worm that had been chased to die. Her white leather shoes kicked the big black bear's stomach, and the trembling big black bear walked forward one step at a time.

"The wind is bleak and the water is cold. Lolita will never return…"

The little girl rode on the big black bear and walked out of the crowd towards the eight tall, fierce lions. Her golden hair fluttered under the sun.

Looking at the eight terrifying giant lions that were emitting a terrifying aura, as well as the huge and mighty black bear, their limbs turned limp and they peed their pants.

The little girl suddenly turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye with sparkling eyes. "King, if Annie is torn to pieces, please bring Annie's dress back and place it in the tree hole to accompany you forever, okay?"

"Please\!"

Chu Xiaoye stared at her with a burning gaze and did not answer.

When it was five meters away from the eight terrifying lions, the big black bear could not walk anymore. It trembled and peed. Even its short tail was curled under its crotch. It was so frightened that it almost fell to the ground, like a pitiful pug.

"Tibbs\! I'm your talented young mage, Princess Annie. Have you forgotten the vow you made to me? Stand up, show your fangs and claws, show your muscles and courage, bite them to death\! Tear them apart\!"

At this moment, the little girl suddenly seemed to be possessed by a god. She raised her little hand, her golden hair fluttered, and her gaze was like a torch. She muttered strange words with a determined tone.

"Roar—"

With a roar, the ground trembled\!
