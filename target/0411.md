Chapter 411: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

A bolt of lightning suddenly cut through the night sky.

Then, the thunder rumbled and dark clouds covered the sky. Soon, a misty rain fell.

The rain came very quickly and was a little coincidental. It even made the members of the pride suspect that it was because of the terrifying roar just now.

Therefore, Belia was even more infatuated with the young lion king.

Chu Xiaoye hid in the bushes under the tree and closed his eyes to rest, quickly recovering the energy he had expended previously.

The other members also crawled into the surrounding bushes to avoid the sudden rain.

The rain was dripping and beating the leaves above them, causing the already cold ancient forest to become even colder.

A head covered in mud quietly popped out of the mud pit and quietly climbed ashore.

It was the unfamiliar lioness.

Under the rain, the mud on her body gradually fell off.

She did not dare to stay for long. She looked nervously at the bushes over there, then turned around and left quietly.

After walking for a distance, she raised her head and jumped onto a big tree agilely. She looked up at the rain in the sky and did not move.

Soon, the mud on her head and body was washed away.

Her eyes were no longer scarlet and even her body became a little smaller than before. However, her strength had increased greatly.

She had always been dizzy previously. It was as if her consciousness had been controlled and she had recovered.

Alisa felt like she had been reborn and was more awake than ever.

Fortunately, she had been wrapped in mud and was not recognized by the young lion king. Otherwise, she would have no chance of crawling out of the mud pit.

She believed that any male would remember the hatred of that tail slap forever and remember it deeply.

She did not know if that young lion king was already crippled. From his attitude towards those females, it was very possible that her tail slap back then had really crippled him.

Hmph, so what if he was crippled? He asked for it\!

However, from today onwards, she would let bygones be bygones.

After all, that fellow saved her tonight and saved her life.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, she suddenly sensed a dangerous aura. She suddenly turned around and saw that there was a ghost-like figure standing on a big tree behind her. It was staring at her coldly.

Alisa was shocked. She turned around and narrowed her eyes at the female cub.

Of course she knew this agile and ruthless lioness cub. They had fought before.

Could it be that this female cub had already recognized her?

Catherine did not recognize her.

However, she had long realized that there was something wrong with this lioness. Furthermore, the scent on her body was similar, as if she had encountered it somewhere.

However, after careful observation, she realized that she was indeed very foreign and that she did not know her.

Alisa's size and appearance had changed. Even Chu Xiaoye might not recognize her if he saw her.

The two young female lions sized each other up from the two trees. Their gazes were sharp and cold. No one seemed to want to ease the tense atmosphere first.

The rain fell and drenched their fur. They were like two stone sculptures standing on a tree motionless.

Like a spar between experts, the battle was about to begin.

Catherine increasingly felt that the lioness in front of her was not simple.

As for Alisa, she was even more puzzled.

The female cub's strength and speed of growth did not seem to be inferior to hers.

The young lion king had already shocked her.

It seemed that this pride was stronger and more mysterious than she had imagined.

Back then, she wanted to kill the young lion king and take control of the pride. Now, she no longer had that thought.

She was really afraid of that lion roar.

Now that she had yet to recover her strength, it was better to leave early.

At the thought of this, Alisa was the first to break the silence. She grinned and expressed her gratitude for their help previously. Now, she should leave.

However, just as she was about to jump down the tree, Catherine suddenly rushed over with a whoosh and pounced at her at lightning speed.

Alisa was furious, but she did not dare to show weakness. She immediately raised her claws to face the attack.

"Bang\!"

The two figures separated.

Alisa jumped onto another branch.

Catherine stood on the branch where she originally stood and looked at her in bewilderment with her dark eyes. She seemed to have thought of her movements and movement technique, but she also seemed to think that she was wrong.

After all, the difference in appearance and size between the two was too big.

Furthermore, the most obvious eyes were completely different.

Just as Catherine was about to attack and probe again, a few figures suddenly rushed over from under the tree. Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly jumped onto the tree with a whoosh and surrounded the unfamiliar lioness.

They smelled the scent of this lioness. It was the lioness covered in mud from before.

Was she preparing to escape secretly?

Little Curly Tail was very angry. He swung his tail and took a few steps forward. He bared his fangs and glared fiercely at the female lion.

Her brother had saved her. She should have stayed in the pride and served her brother like other lionesses. Now, she actually wanted to escape silently while her brother was resting. She was ungrateful\!

Mei Mei was also very angry. She growled and told the lioness that she was already her brother's lioness and could not leave the pride alone\!

Previously, this lioness was covered in mud and she did not see her appearance clearly. Now, she saw that not only was this lioness young, she was also beautiful. Her brother's pride needed to expand and her brother was about to mature. He needed many young female lions to serve and mate with. This lioness was very suitable. Therefore, she could forget about leaving\!

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur, who heard the noise, rushed over and surrounded the tree.

Alisa was furious. She looked at this group of fellows coldly. They actually wanted to force her to stay and use her as that fellow's mating tool to hunt and have children for him\!

How was that possible\!

Her ambition and ideals were definitely not something a lion or a pride could restrain\!

She would never be like those pitiful female lions, trembling in fear as she worked hard in the pride and compromised for the rest of her life\!

She did not want to be a slave\! She did not want to be a tool for giving birth\! She did not want to be a nanny\! She did not want to be a pitiful worm that was always roaring under the pressure of a lion\!

She wanted to be a lion king\!

A lion king that made all the female lions and lions roar and tremble\!

Of course, the prerequisite was to keep her life firstâ€¦

She restrained the anger in her eyes, lowered her arrogant head, and jumped down from the tree. She obediently returned to the mud pit and lay there.

"Just you wait\!"

Alisa snorted inwardly.
