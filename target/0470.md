Chapter 470: Climbing On The Giant Tree

A week later.

The wounds on Mei Mei and Molly finally healed completely.

Just as the little girl had said, after the big black bear slept, it immediately became lively the next day. It was alive and kicking. The half of its face and head that had collapsed had almost no signs of recovery.

This was magical. To an animal without any treatment.

Chu Xiaoye observed this strange and magical human-bear combination silently as he led Little Curly Tail and the others to fight around the territory.

After a short week, the neighbors on the surrounding grassland knew of the existence of their pride and admitted that they had indisputable sovereignty over this territory.

Of course, there would inevitably be some friction and unhappiness during this period.

Chu Xiaoye's solution was very simple. He flashed his golden claws and cut off his head.

Hence, all the friction and unhappiness disappeared. Although the neighbors could not be said to be happy and harmonious, they were exchanged for temporary harmony, respect, and fear each other, not attacking each other.

After Chu Xiaoye established his dominance in this territory, he started to prepare to deal with the thing on the super huge tree.

Over the past few nights, he had slept in the same cave as the little girl, but he did not discover that the vine-like monster had come down again.

However, regardless of whether the other party would come again, this trouble had to be resolved.

How could such a dangerous thing exist beside a bed?

If he wanted to solve the problem on the tree, he naturally had to climb up the tree first.

How to climb over the sea of mucus on the tree trunk was the question he was thinking about.

The increasingly sharp claws and his increasingly heavy body would not be of any help to him at this time. Instead, they would drag him down and make it difficult for him to move an inch on the sticky tree trunk.

He could not solve it with force and could only rely on his intelligence.

Fortunately, he had the intelligence of humans and lions. He could not be said to be very smart, but he was definitely smarter than most animals.

The branches on this super tree were thick and lush. They extended in all directions and almost covered the entire forest. Although there were some small trees in the forest, if one stood on the top of those small trees and suddenly jumped up, they could definitely jump onto those thick branches if they jumped high enough.

If he could not climb up from the main trunk, he could jump up from the side branch and solve the problem.

Chu Xiaoye was still very confident in his jumping ability.

After thinking of this method, he immediately took action.

He brought Catherine and Alisa around the entire forest and finally found the most suitable tree.

This tree could be said to be very tall compared to the other trees beside it, but compared to the super huge tree, it was pitifully small and could not even compare to the other party's branch.

Chu Xiaoye brought the two female lions and quickly climbed up the canopy of this tree.

Standing on the swaying canopy, Chu Xiaoye looked up and realized that he was still very far from the thick branch of the giant tree above him.

The canopy was not land. It could not run and could not exert all its strength. Furthermore, it was jumping up in a straight line. It naturally could not jump too high. However, to Chu Xiaoye, this distance should be enough.

As for Catherine and Alisa, they did not need to see to know that they could not go up.

Alisa looked up and gave up. She even rolled her eyes like the human girl, indicating that only those who courted death would jump at this height.

"I don't want to die."

She snorted proudly and turned around. She despised Chu Xiaoye, who had suggested this.

If he accidentally fell from here, there was only one outcome—his body would be crushed\!

Chu Xiaoye looked back at her and then at Catherine. Then, he raised his head and looked up. His limbs slowly bent and he started to accumulate strength.

At the same time, he quietly raised his tail.

Catherine's dark and bright eyes suddenly constricted. With a whoosh, she jumped down from the canopy and instantly landed on the ground.

Alisa stood on the canopy and looked down at her in shock.

What's wrong?

"Boom —"

Just as she was feeling puzzled by Catherine's actions, an explosion suddenly sounded beside her. At the same time, a terrifying airflow swept through the entire canopy like a hurricane\!

As if the night had suddenly swallowed the day, the vision in front of Alisa instantly turned black\!

Black fog covered the sky\!

The entire canopy swayed violently like duckweed in a storm.

A terrifying and familiar stench suddenly crawled into her nose and mouth without her being prepared\!

She stood upright on the canopy, in the storm, in the black fog, and in the stench.

At this moment, she finally understood Catherine's actions.

"Ugh —"

There were thousands of words in her heart, all sorts of curses and curses. At this moment, they all turned into this painful and desperate vomiting sound.

She grabbed the branch, held her breath, and started to doubt lion life.

Chu Xiaoye used this airflow and suddenly jumped up. Like a fire sword that was fired, he rushed into the sky and landed easily on the branch extended by the super huge tree.

The thickness of this branch was not inferior to the trunk of a ten-thousand-year-old ancient tree. It was covered in old bark left behind by time, but it was lush and full of life.

Chu Xiaoye stepped on this branch and walked towards the center of the tree.

However, after walking for a distance, he realized that there was a super huge nest on the path in front of him. It was hidden between the dense leaves and looked like the nest of some poisonous bee.

"Buzz…"

A familiar sound suddenly came from beside him.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly turned around and was shocked.

A black poisonous bee the size of a sparrow was flapping its transparent wings and hanging on his right. It was only three meters away from his head. Its green eyes were staring at him coldly like a venomous snake and did not move.

Chu Xiaoye stood there like a part of the tree, not daring to move at all.

Fortunately, there was only one. With his speed, he could completely cut this poisonous bee in half with his sharp claws. He would never give the other party any chance to shoot out poisonous thorns, as long as it dared to approach\!

"Buzz…"

Suddenly, more buzzing sounds came from his ears.

Chu Xiaoye's heart shrank and he did not dare to move his head. He looked askance and saw more poisonous bees flying over with a murderous aura, as if they had received an alarm\!

At the same time, many poisonous bees popped their heads out of the huge beehive and prepared to move.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye knew that even his farts might not be able to save him. He was so close to the beehive and the poisonous bees were so fierce. All the poisonous bees would probably move out and sting him with all their might.

Even if he was only pierced, he might fall down from here and be crushed\!

He had threatened the other party's nest.

For now, he could only stand here and hold his breath, not moving, pretending to be a part of this tree.

Otherwise, he would definitely die.

"I'm a tree… I'm a tree…"

God bless\!

These stupid poisonous bees seemed to really treat him as a tree.

All the poisonous bees flapped their wings and stopped in front of him. They did not attack. Pairs of green eyes stared at him, as if they were puzzled and curious.

"Look, this branch is really strange\!"

This was probably what they were thinking at this moment.

Chu Xiaoye stared and stopped breathing. He did not move and was secretly happy.

Their plan finally succeeded\!

Before long, the poisonous bees seemed to have finally lost interest in him and started to retreat wave after wave.

Chu Xiaoye finally heaved a sigh of relief.

However, before he could spit out this breath, the retreating poisonous bees suddenly returned.

They landed on the golden mane on his neck and started to cut the beautiful golden fur with their sharp mouths\!

They had actually taken a fancy to his golden mane and wanted to pull out all the light and bring it back to decorate the beehive\!
