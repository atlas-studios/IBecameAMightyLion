Chapter 130: The Lost Young Elephant

"Boom —"

The sound of a car suddenly came from behind\!

They were still chasing\!

It seemed that they were determined to get him. They would not stop until they caught up to him\!

Then, he was even more at ease.

Their goal was indeed only him.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left the grassland, running towards the dry river at the foot of the hill.

There was no way for cars to chase on the road here.

He followed the cracked riverbed and continued to run west under the hot sun.

The arrow on his neck swayed and could not be pulled out in time.

This was the first time he was in such a sorry state and so terrified since he came to this grassland.

Was he going to be caught and cut?

Or, like that tiger, were they going to inject some terrifying gene into his body and make him become their test subject?

Or would he be caught and sent to the zoo to perform for others to see?

No\!

How could he allow that to happen?

As an animal, if he did not even have his last freedom, he might as well die.

Gunshots suddenly sounded from behind.

He did not dare to look back and used all his strength to continue running.

He was shot by an anesthetic gun but could still escape. The humans behind him would probably be very surprised.

Therefore, they would rather kill him with their guns than let him escape.

However, the sounds of gunshots and shouting grew further and further away.

The dry and hard riverbed was like a winding ravine that gave him the best cover and route to escape.

The speed of the humans' two legs could not compare to his four legs.

Finally, after an unknown period of time, when his vision was blurry from running and he was about to faint, he could no longer hear those annoying and terrifying sounds behind him.

But.

He still did not dare to stop.

He continued forward under the hot sun that was like a flame.

Until the sky turned dark.

He was exhausted, tired, hungry, thirsty, and dizzy. He felt like the world was spinning.

He lay on the still hot riverbed, turned his head, and bit the arrow that was stuck in his neck, pulling it out.

Then, he lay there and closed his eyes, not wanting to move.

The night was silent.

The night wind, which was kicking him while he was down, swept the soil and fluttered it, scattering it on him, as if it wanted to bury him on this dry and cracked riverbed.

He looked like a pitiful worm that had been abandoned and was about to die.

He slept very soundly.

In his daze, he seemed to hear a strange noise or feel something rubbing his head.

He was shocked and woke up.

He raised his head and saw a young elephant standing in front of him.

At this moment, this young elephant was using its nose to rub his head, as if it was urging him to wake up.

Where there were young elephants, there were naturally elephants.

If the elephant herd saw a carnivore like him, they would definitely not treat him so gently.

However, there was no sign of an elephant herd around.

This young elephant looked like a lone figure. It might be lost.

Since it was lost and could not find its mother, it should quickly go find her. Why was it using its nose against him?

Could it be that he, the dignified future lion king, looked like its mother?

Chu Xiaoye stood up with difficulty and licked his dry lips. His gaze drooled as he looked at the delicious meal that had been sent to him.

He was hungry and needed to eat meat.

He was thirsty and needed to drink blood.

This small elephant was enough for him to eat his fill. In fact, it was more than enough.

At this moment, he suddenly felt a sharp pain under his feet\!

He was shocked. He looked down and realized that the place he was lying on was filled with ants\!

These ants were extremely big, like hornets. One could clearly see their sharp mouths\!

At this moment, they were crawling along his limbs in groups towards his body\!

Some ants could not help but bite his fur\!

Chu Xiaoye was frightened. He hurriedly ran away for a distance and rolled around in the mud. Then, he jumped up and quickly shook his fur.

Some ants had already crawled onto his face\!

He could only raise his front limbs and slap them quickly as if he was slapping himself.

At this moment, the densely packed giant ants actually chased over quickly again, as if they did not care about his size and whether he was still alive. They were all extremely fierce and wanted to put him down, break him into pieces, and drag him back to their nest\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay in this riverbed anymore. He hurriedly climbed up the riverbank and ran up the hill. Then, he continued to roll on the withered grass.

No matter how mighty a king was, he was also afraid of these countless little things.

Furthermore, he was not a king yet.

The young elephant also wagged its nose and slowly followed.

Was this a moving delicacy?

The service was really considerate.

Chu Xiaoye decided to eat it after rolling.

As for the favor of waking him up with its nose and saving him from being bitten by those ants, he would not return it.

He was a carnivore. As long as it was meat, he would eat it\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Right at this moment, familiar and annoying cries sounded from the grassland not far away.

The hyenas were here\!

Chu Xiaoye got up from the ground and looked up at the group of hyenas that were running over. He actually felt a little familiar.

It had been a long time since he last saw this group of bastards.

However, he had yet to recover his power and strength.

The effect of the anesthetic was still lingering in his body. Although it was melted a little by the heat in his abdomen at the beginning, it still required time to completely disappear.

After a moment.

The ten-over hyenas cried out and surrounded him.

Of course, they did not come for him, but for this young elephant that had lost the protection of its herd.

However, this young elephant did not escape. Instead, it slowly walked behind him and hid.

Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched and he was a little dumbfounded.

What did this mean?

Could he, the mighty future lion king, not look as terrifying as these hyenas?

This was an insult to him\! A deep insult\!

"Roar—"

He immediately roared angrily and bared his sharp fangs, showing his might as a lion\!

The hyenas seemed to be afraid.

However, the young elephant hiding behind him seemed to have misunderstood him. Not only was it not afraid, but it also looked very excited. It immediately raised its nose at the hyenas and let out a pleased cry.

It seemed to be saying, "Come on, puppies. This is my father\! My father is not to be trifled with\!"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

This provocation angered these ferocious killers\!

They were already dizzy from hunger. It was not easy for them to find a young elephant without the protection of a herd, so they naturally would not let go of this delicious meal easily\!

Furthermore, in their eyes, Chu Xiaoye was just an underage cub covered in mud and in a miserable situation.

They let out noisy and fierce cries and started to run around Chu Xiaoye and the young elephant.

They would occasionally sprint forward and occasionally stop in their tracks to jump to the side. As they threatened, they created chaos, as if they wanted to make this young cub retreat in the face of adversity.

However, Chu Xiaoye ignored them.

He lay on the ground and continued to use his feet to sweep away the ants on his neck and head.

The little elephant hiding behind him actually raised its nose and cleaned his back gently, looking obedient like a son fawning on his father and a little brother fawning on his big brother.

This made Chu Xiaoye feel very embarrassed in front of these ferocious enemies.

As a majestic lion, and one that was still underage, how could he have an elephant son or an elephant brother?

How embarrassing\!
