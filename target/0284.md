Chapter 284: Lion Nursing Home

"Roar\!"

Just as the elderly lions were about to walk far away, the cold father suddenly let out a dignified roar. He faced the morning sun and ran over like the wind.

He passed by Chu Xiaoye and did not look at this unfilial son.

His mane was lush, his movements were strong, and he was still strong.

However, he would also grow old one day.

Therefore, he chased after them.

As for what he was going to do, even he did not know.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and looked at his back, not stopping him.

The cold father caught up to the group of old lions and let out a dignified growl. He looked over and looked at him, as if he was angry.

The lions stopped, their gazes uneasy and hesitant.

The cold father continued to roar angrily, as if he was guaranteeing something.

After a long time.

Under the lead of the cold father, the group of old lions turned around and returned, but they lowered their heads and did not dare to look at the mixed fur and the young king.

The cold father raised his head and glared at his unfilial son without showing any weakness.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him and turned around to look at the mixed fur. He asked about the safety of the public area near the river.

In order to prevent conflicts over drinking water, at the foot of the mountain, there was a long area near the river that was not divided into the territory of every team.

The mixed fur thought for a moment and expressed that the grassland was still considered safe.

Because it was near the river, many herbivores would go over every evening and there was plenty of food.

He understood what this young king meant.

The cold father brought the pride and stopped in front of them, looking at them angrily.

Chu Xiaoye and Mixed Fur also looked at him.

The cold father finally lost and looked elsewhere.

He knew that this was wrong, but the scene he saw just now seemed to have touched something and he suddenly could not suppress the urge in his heart.

The sun set and the hero fell.

Everyone had this day.

In a few years, he would become them too.

At that time, would the old and weak him be disliked and abandoned by the pride?

The cold father looked at the distant grassland with a disappointed gaze.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the group of old lions and did not say anything. He let the mixed fur bring them to the grass by the river and let them stay there.

He could only give them a place to stay temporarily so that they did not have to wander around, let alone take the risk to go to the grassland occupied by the black lions.

This was all he could do.

As for whether they could catch prey or survive there, no one could care. They could only rely on themselves.

Then, in the other prides, there would also be many old lions and disabled lions chased away. They could all go there.

At least, that land was still under his protection for the time being.

As for the administrators of that land, they were free to choose.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the cold father and left with Catherine.

When the elderly lions saw that this young king no longer chased them away and gave them a new land, they were extremely grateful. Their dim and desperate gazes were filled with hope again.

The cold father looked silently at the distant figure, then brought these old lions to follow behind Mixed Fur and head to the new territory.

He became the manager of that territory and the king of that pride.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and continued to patrol the territory.

In the evening.

He returned to the bushes, but he did not see the cold father.

The female lions were a little surprised.

Ever since he came here, the cold father had never left home for too long like today. He had yet to return until evening.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly took the initiative to search the bushes, but they found nothing.

The Belita sisters told them that they did not see the cold father.

The family looked at each other.

Chu Xiaoye did not tell them what happened today.

Since the cold father had yet to return, there was no need for them to wait.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride to the river to drink water.

Nunu and Qiqi rode on the back of Pit and played carefreely.

The lover of Pit, the female warthog, was sleeping in the cave.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at every member of the pride of the cold father and was hesitant. Now that the cold father was not here, should he tell them now?

Mei Mei stayed close to his body and deliberately stuck to him as she walked.

Little Curly Tail stuck to his other side.

These two fellows always fought for favor with each other and never gave in.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and decided to bring the pride to the river at the back to drink water.

He needed to see what the cold father was doing there.

Although everyone was curious about where he was going, they did not hesitate and immediately followed closely behind him.

Soon.

They came to the public area near the river.

At this moment, this area had already become a true retirement home.

The director of the nursing home was the cold father, who was in his prime.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the members of the pride of the cold father into this territory, he immediately saw the group of old lions hunting.

A group of zebras were surrounded in the middle.

However, when the zebras ran with all their might, they immediately rushed out of their encirclement and even knocked away the two old lions that jumped up to stop them.

The cold father's mane fluttered as he led the remaining elderly lions and continued to chase\!

His brave and active appearance and high fighting spirit were completely different compared to his lazy appearance when hunting in his pride.

When Aisha, the female lions, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei saw this scene, their faces were filled with shock and disbelief.

Their king, their father, was actually hunting here with a group of old lions\!

From the looks of it, he had already become the boss of this group of old lions\!

The zebras ran very quickly and ferociously. Soon, they left the cold father and the elderly lions behind.

The elderly lions panted heavily and gradually slowed down, having already given up.

As for the cold father, he still chased with all his might.

The zebras ran towards Chu Xiaoye and the others.

The cold father suddenly saw them and immediately roared, telling them to help and stop the zebra.

Just as Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were about to rush up, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and looked at them. His gaze was cold and dignified. He no longer looked like a brother but like a king.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were stunned. They immediately stopped in place and did not move.

When the female lions saw this scene, they stood in place and watched helplessly as the zebras ran past them, but they did not help stop them.

The cold father followed behind and roared angrily. Seeing that the zebras had run out of the territory and were getting further and further away, he could only give up.

He came in front of them with a dark face and panted heavily, looking flustered and exasperated. He let out an angry roar, as if he was questioning something.

However, everyone looked at him silently and did not answer.

Facing his furious gaze and roar, only Nunu and Qiqi lay on the back of Pit in fear, trembling.

The cold father looked at his unfilial son.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him and ignored the anger in his eyes. He turned around and left with the pride to drink water by the river.

Walk the path you have chosen yourself. No one would carry you.

If you walked over, you would be a hero and admired by everyone. Everyone would be happy for you.

If you can't make it, come back. Everyone is still waiting for you at the intersection.
