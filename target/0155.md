Chapter 155: Hunting in the Grassland

They followed the stream.

Along the way, they saw all sorts of animals.

The animals here seemed to be much stronger than the animals on the grassland.

There was no harsh environment on the grassland here.

Be it herbivores or carnivores, they all looked especially strong.

Their combat strength was also much stronger than that of the animals on the grassland.

Having a good environment did not mean that there was no worry about survival.

Due to the shrinking territory making them interact more closely, their competition would be even more intense. The ones that stayed would also be stronger.

On the other side of the mountain, when there was enough food during the rainy season, the territory of every animal would shrink.

This way, they could eat food and not waste too much time and energy protecting more territory.

Because with every extra bit of territory, they would face more challenges and dangers.

Many challenges would put their lives in danger.

The most important thing was to be able to eat and survive.

The stream ran through the forest and extended to the foot of the mountain, flowing into a colorful lake.

The water in the lake flowed from a stream to the Bar River that spanned the grassland. The river flowed west and merged into the distant sea.

Due to the constant rain, the water in the rivers and lakes had always been overflowing.

In every corner of the grassland, there were also many water pits and swamps that nurtured generations of grassland animals.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the team out of the forest, they happened to arrive in front of the lake.

The fiery red sun shone in the clear lake. The water surface that was wrinkled by the breeze was sparkling, as beautiful and tempting as an orange soda.

Chu Xiaoye decided to rest here for the night.

They had not eaten for a few days after crossing the mountains.

He had to catch some prey tonight.

He growled at the Chino brothers and let them solve the food problem themselves.

In this team, only Doya could not hunt by herself. Therefore, the prey he caught would only be shared with this female cub.

Furthermore, her appetite was tiny and she did not need to trouble him to catch another one.

But the Chino brothers were different.

They were all tall and strong adult lions. After running around training and eating, they were no longer as thin as before. They had long recovered the aura and strength of lions.

Their appetite was astonishing. They had to hunt by themselves, or they would starve to death.

As for the little elephant, food was everywhere for it. He did not need to worry.

As for the jackal couple, they did not need his instructions and quietly left to find prey in the bushes not far away.

They were small in size and had little appetite. A wild rabbit was enough.

The Chino brothers were in a difficult position, but they had no choice but to bite the bullet and follow the jackal couple to the bushes over there.

Their manes were too lush and it was not easy to hunt on the grassland. They could only hide in the bushes and try their luck.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment and decided to take a look at the grassland.

The grassland here was lush and beautiful. Naturally, groups of herbivores stayed.

He did not have claws, but he had speed and sharp teeth and great strength. Therefore, he could hunt anywhere.

"Moo--Moo--"

A herd of water buffaloes appeared on the grassland in front of him.

However, those water buffaloes were extremely strong and were not alone. He could not go up to hunt them alone.

Although water buffaloes would sometimes watch their companions get caught and not save them, most of them would save their companions under the lead of the lead bull.

Unless they were old, weak, sick, or disabled.

They hated lions very much. As long as they saw lions, they would chase them away in groups with their size and strength.

When they encountered young cubs, they would kill them mercilessly.

Therefore, they and lions were also old enemies on the grassland.

Chu Xiaoye followed the dense grass and walked 100 meters away, looking at them with a burning gaze.

If there were small water buffaloes or water buffaloes that could not move freely, he did not mind testing his skills.

He was lucky.

Soon, he discovered a water buffalo with an injured hind leg.

It was an old water buffalo. It had clearly been chased by other hunters previously and had a scar on its hind leg. Perhaps it was because its injuries were too severe or it was infected. It was very inconvenient for it to walk with a limp.

It wanted to eat grass in the middle of the herd, but the other water buffaloes clearly disliked it and did not let it occupy the middle.

Only pregnant cows and calves could occupy a good position.

It had to stay outside and continue to show its value while eating grass.

Otherwise, the herd would chase it away.

Because it could not move freely, it would attract more hunters and put the entire tribe in danger.

It was not a virtue in the animal world to respect the old and love the young.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his body and started to move forward, staring fixedly at the injured water buffalo.

He really wanted to try his strength on this still strong water buffalo.

When he approached under the cover of the grass until he was 50 meters away from the water buffalo, the water buffalo raised its head and looked over.

Chu Xiaoye immediately lay down and hid in the grass.

After a moment, he raised his head and looked over.

The water buffalo did not seem to have discovered anything and was still lowering its head to eat the grass.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and prepared to continue approaching.

However, right at this moment, he suddenly smelled a special scent and a dangerous aura from the evening breeze.

He turned around and saw a strong adult female lion squatting in the dense grass two meters to his right.

The adult lioness was twisting her head and looking at him coldly.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and looked further away. Not far from this adult lioness, two more female lions appeared.

Then, he turned around and looked to the left.

Four to five meters away, an adult lioness was lowering her body and approaching the injured water buffalo.

Further away, the few adult female lions also started to move.

They had already set up an ambush and had their eyes on this injured water buffalo. Just as they were about to take action, Chu Xiaoye, the young cub, barged in.

This stunned the leading lioness.

This territory was theirs\!

Furthermore, did this cub want to catch that water buffalo alone?

Under normal circumstances, they would have already started attacking and biting.

But at this moment, food was still the most important.

They had to capture that water buffalo first, then deal with this little lion that was biting off more than it could chew\!

"Whoosh â€”"

The female lion beside Chu Xiaoye ignored him and immediately rushed out like an arrow\!

The female lions in the other directions also got up and cooperated, starting to chase and intercept\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment, and he was a little hesitant. Should he go forward and take a share of the food, or should he turn around and leave to hunt elsewhere?

However, other places were probably their territory too.

He did not want to go too far.

Furthermore, wasn't it the nature of lions to snatch the food of female lions?
