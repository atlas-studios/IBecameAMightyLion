Chapter 485: Kill Himself\!

"Whoosh —"

A whirlwind attacked with snowflakes. The snow mountain in the distance suddenly seemed to have become closer.

At the same time, a huge light curtain fell from the sky and blocked the front of the snow mountain, causing the originally majestic snow mountain to look even more hazy and majestic, filled with mystery.

"We're about to arrive."

No wonder the little girl was so excited. She had long known.

Chu Xiaoye had indeed absorbed something from the fiery red pterodactyl, but he did not know what it was.

In the past, when he obtained skills from other animals, he could immediately use them. But now, no matter how he used them, he could not release the energy that he had just absorbed into his body.

Perhaps it was just some heat.

Chu Xiaoye was rather disappointed.

But now was not the time to sigh in frustration.

Not only did the giant crocodiles not decrease, they increased in number.

The green pterodactyl that fled was also a threat.

The little girl carried her spear and rode on the big black bear's back, urging him to walk faster.

They circled around the giant crocodiles that were snatching food and continued forward.

The snow mountain ahead was getting closer and closer.

As if it was shrinking the ground to inches, the snow mountain automatically shrank the distance and suddenly came close to them.

In the evening.

They came in front of the curtain of light that looked like water.

Through the light screen, he looked at the snow mountain. Although it was very close, he could only see snow. He could not even see rocks or trees.

However, Chu Xiaoye could see the general outline.

This snow mountain was indeed the snow mountain he had gone and seen before.

Although they had only passed by the foot of the mountain back then, they could see it clearly.

However, from the looks of it, although it was the same, it felt greatly different, as if it added an ethereal and mysterious feeling.

"Are we finally here?"

The little girl climbed down from the big black bear's back and stood in front of the light screen. She was in a daze and muttered to herself, as if the wandering son who had been traveling for many years had finally returned to his hometown.

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and touched the light screen.

"Pfft\!"

The light screen suddenly rippled like water, and his claws easily passed through.

His heart skipped a beat. He raised his feet and walked in.

As if he had torn open a thin layer of mucus, Chu Xiaoye walked in with a trace of resistance on his head.

The whistling wind stopped\!

The scene in front of him suddenly disappeared.

After a moment of darkness, he suddenly saw a new world\!

The first thing that came into view was a primitive forest made of ice and jade. The ground was filled with thick snow and the tall and thick ancient trees had also turned into ice sculptures. Looking across, snow covered the sky, as if they had arrived in the legendary world of ice and snow.

The snow here was not snow-white and dazzling, but faint blue. It was much gentler and more beautiful than the snow outside just now.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a few seconds before he immediately raised his head and looked at the snow mountain.

The strange thing was that the snow mountain that was clearly in front of him just now suddenly disappeared\!

There were indeed many continuous mountain ranges ahead, but they were not the majestic snow mountain at all.

Could it be that what he saw previously had always been an illusion?

That should not be the case. That snow mountain did exist. He had clearly been there before.

Could it be that what he saw now was a fantasy?

A familiar aura and slightly rapid breathing suddenly came from behind.

Catherine came in too.

The little lioness was not mentally prepared for the sudden change in scene in front of her. She was more shocked and confused than him.

"That snow mountain is still here, but you can't see it for the time being. However, the snow mountain you see outside is very different from the snow mountain inside. The snow mountain outside is only the shadow of the snow mountain inside."

The little girl walked in with the big black bear and explained meaningfully.

"Shadow?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned when he heard this and turned to look at her.

If the snow mountain outside was only the shadow of the snow mountain here, could the white lions he had seen before be shadows?

How was this possible?

"King, have you ever been to the snow mountain outside?"

Seeing him look at her strangely, the little girl's heart skipped a beat and she asked with interest.

Chu Xiaoye did not hide his identity as a lion anymore and nodded like a human, indicating that he had indeed been there.

The little girl's eyes lit up and she immediately asked, "Then you must have seen lions or other animals of another race there, right?"

Chu Xiaoye nodded again and extended his claws to write on the ice on the ground, "White Lion."

"Indeed…"

The little girl was in a daze for a moment and was not surprised that he could write.

She raised her head and stared at Chu Xiaoye with a burning gaze. "If I say that those white lions and any animals on the snow mountains, including you and all the creatures you saw in the past, were all shadows reflected from this world, would you believe me?"

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled and he shook his head stiffly.

It was not that he did not believe it, but he did not dare to believe it.

After living for two lives and seeing all sorts of creatures, they were actually just shadows. How could he accept this?

The little girl sighed and said, "Actually, I don't believe it either. Thinking about our previous lives, the people in the past, and the various things they have seen, they are suddenly all fake. They are all illusory programs projected in the past by another world. Who can believe it, who is willing to believe it?"

"But, King, I can tell you with certainty that what I'm saying to you now and what you see are true. What I'm saying now is true."

The little girl said seriously.

Chu Xiaoye still did not believe it.

If they were really just shadows, how could they have come here? It was like when you were looking at the mirror in front of a dressing mirror, changing your clothes, and making all sorts of movements, the you in the mirror suddenly crawled out and stood in front of you\!

How was this possible?

How could two identical creatures appear in the same world?

How could a shadow come out from the mirror?

"The dragon has already appeared and you, a lion, can write. Tell me, what's impossible?"

The little girl retorted plausibly.

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

There was indeed no way to explain this.

"It's up to you whether you believe it or not\!"

The little girl waved the spear in her hand and suddenly turned around. She threw it forward and the spear shot out. With a puff, it pierced through the thick ice and into the tree trunk in front of her. The spear trembled non-stop.

"Look, even a weak little loli knows how to fight\!"

The little girl blinked proudly, and then her expression became serious. She said, "Listen, before we came in, we were all shadows. We could suffer an unexpected disaster at any time, be destroyed and disappeared, and our lives would always be in the hands of others. But now, we're all real. We won't die with our true bodies here because they suddenly died. Now, our lives are in our hands. We have to be serious\!"

"Then, how should I be serious?"

The little girl walked in front of the tree and hugged the spear. She pulled it out of the tree trunk with all her might and placed it on her shoulder. Her young and exquisite face suddenly revealed killing intent. "We have to find and kill them before our true bodies find and kill us\!"

"That's right, kill yourself\!"
