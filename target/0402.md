Chapter 402: Untitled

After dawn.

The pride continued to walk down the mountain.

The big black bear carried the little girl and followed at the back. It was neither fast nor slow and looked rather relaxed.

The other members of the pride were all preoccupied.

The dense forest at the foot of the mountain was their new home.

However, their initial excitement and anticipation on the mountain turned into worry.

The environment here was not suitable for them.

Even if they worked hard to adapt, they might not be able to adapt.

To them, the most important herbivores were nowhere to be seen.

Along the way, he did not see any other animals.

Chu Xiaoye was also puzzled.

Where did the herbivores that had fled from the grassland go?

Lions lived in groups. They had many members now and would consume a lot of food every time. Therefore, if there were not a large number of herbivores here, they could not survive here.

The carnivores in the forest had always been alone. It was not that they were unwilling to live in groups, but the food here was too scarce and they could only survive separately.

Chu Xiaoye originally thought that the herbivores on the grassland would escape here and survive here again, forming a new ecological environment here.

However, the current situation made him a little uneasy.

Along the way, they only saw a few sporadic grassland animals. Most grassland animals did not stay in this forest.

The migrating army formed by the majestic beast pack did not leave any traces on this path. Clearly, they did not walk from here and did not intend to come here.

They had predicted the arrival of disaster in advance and probably chose a better path to a better place of survival.

In this critical moment, he had no choice but to lead the pride up the mountain and cross the mountains to here.

Even if he took a wrong path, there was no chance to turn back.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the hill and raised his head to look at the distant forest and the continuous mountains further away. His eyes revealed a hint of confusion.

Where should they go?

Perhaps, he should continue forward and find another grassland full of cows and sheep.

However, where was that grassland?

The mountains and rivers were heavy, and the forest was like the sea. How far would they have to walk before there would be a day when light would shine at the end of the tunnel?

Chu Xiaoye turned around and realized that everyone was looking at him.

Their eyes were filled with trust and anticipation.

Even in this situation, they still believed that he could bring them to find a beautiful home again.

The little girl rode on the big black bear's back and raised her small fists. Her eyes were bright as she encouraged loudly, "We can definitely survive\! Come on\!"

She did not know that when the pride completely ran out of food, it was very possible that she was a delicacy.

Chu Xiaoye was always a lion.

Continue forward\!

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

Soon, they came to the foot of the mountain and entered an even lusher forest.

In the evening, they finally saw the river that surrounded the mountains and forest.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others to the river to investigate before summoning the pride to drink water.

The river water was clear, sweet and delicious, but also cold.

Everyone trembled from drinking.

After drinking the water, Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and walked downstream. He finally found a narrow river filled with large rocks.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and stepped on the reef in the river to cross the river.

At this moment, the sky had already turned dark.

Chu Xiaoye let the pride camp not far from the riverbank. He brought Little Curly Tail and the others to the nearby forest to search for prey.

Walking on the mountain path consumed the most energy and the most food in their bodies. They had not eaten their fill last night. In order to cope with tomorrow's journey, they had to eat tonight.

However, there was very little food in the huge forest.

Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail, and the others searched the nearby forest for a long time but did not find any prey.

They had no choice but to walk further.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was already sure that this forest was definitely not a place they could survive in. The food here was even rarer than the food in the forest previously.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to go too far, afraid that the members left in the camp would encounter an accident. After hunting a few pheasants, he returned the way he came.

When they returned to the camp, they realized that the leopard family of four was eating a three-meter-long python.

In front of the little girl was a big snow-white fish. The big black bear was nowhere to be seen.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of the river beside him.

If there were no other prey, it was not bad to catch some fish and fill their stomachs.

Chu Xiaoye left the few pheasants behind and threw them to the female lions. He brought Little Curly Tail and the others to the river.

When they came to the river, they realized that the big black bear was indeed fishing and eating in the river.

The big black bear looked tall and bloated, but it was actually extremely agile. When it jumped in the water, it could slap a fish unconscious with its claws.

However, this big black bear was extremely picky when eating. It only ate the fish skin. After tearing off the fish skin and eating it, it threw away the remaining fish meat.

Chu Xiaoye jumped into the water and hid. Soon, he bit a fish and grabbed a fish on his left and right claws, floating up.

When the big black bear, who was good at fishing, saw this scene, it immediately widened its small eyes in shock.

Little Curly Tail jumped into the water and used his tail to slap randomly in the water. Occasionally, he would hit a fish, but he would slap it into pieces and not catch one after a long time.

Chu Xiaoye growled and called for the members waiting in the camp to come over and catch fish to eat.

Fishes varied in size, but to lions, four to five might not be enough to fill their stomachs. He could only let them hunt by themselves.

Although this was not the grassland and the members of the pride had yet to adapt, they could not live a life of eating or they would become lazy.

If he did it himself, he would have plenty of food and clothing.

The little girl also followed and sat on the shore. She used a small knife to carefully cut the fish, cut it into a thin piece, and placed it in her mouth.

In the little girl's opinion, not only was the fish's meat tender, there was also very little blood. It was much more delicious than animal meat.

Chu Xiaoye ate five fish in a row. When he looked up, he realized that other than a few agile female lions accidentally catching a few fish, the other members were anxious. They flailed in the water, but they could not catch a fish.

Even Mei Mei and Molly's minds were in a mess. In their anger, they started to slap around in the water.

Catherine stood on the shore and did not go into the water to embarrass herself.

She did not like water and knew her limits.

The kings on the grassland were flustered and at a loss for the first time when they hunted in the water.

The cold father even choked on water and almost drowned.

Chu Xiaoye was helpless. He growled and ordered everyone to go ashore.

At this rate, the fish here would be scared away by them.

The members of the pride all went ashore like drenched chickens with dejected expressions.

The little girl handed the fish in her hand to Catherine and said softly, "Eat."

She knew that this powerful lioness cub had always been protecting her silently.

However, Catherine ignored her. Her dark eyes flickered as she stared at the figure in the river.

Chu Xiaoye dived into the water alone and started to kill the fish underwater.

Under his speed and sharp claws, snow-white fish broke out of the water and flew ashore as if they were dancing.

The members of the pride were overjoyed and immediately wolfed down the food.

When the big black bear saw this scene, it could not be bothered to waste time in the water. It immediately climbed ashore, stretched its neck, and used its mouth to catch the fish that had flown ashore.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Waves splashed everywhere and fish continuously flew up from the water. Soon, they landed on the shore in a white patch.

The members of the pride ate in a hurry. They ate one bite after another and the fish was so plentiful that they could not finish them.

Chu Xiaoye realized that there were many fish in the river and it was almost overflowing.

Furthermore, these fish were all stupid and did not have any attack power. They seemed to be gathering and were swimming upstream.

"Bang—"

Just as he was quickly catching fish at the bottom of the river, a gunshot suddenly came from the opposite riverbank\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart suddenly shrank. He hurriedly floated to the water and stuck out his head to look. The forest on the other side immediately sounded with human voices.

He hurriedly swam ashore at his fastest speed, but he realized that the tall mixed fur had already fallen into a pool of blood. A bloody hole had appeared on his back\!

Mixed Fur lay on the ground with his eyes wide open, as if he did not know what was happening.

He did not know who the enemy was or what he was injured by. His wide eyes were filled with fear and confusion.

The other members of the pride ran towards the forest in fear, but they did not run far. They stood there and watched in a daze, as if they did not know what was happening.

As for the little girl, she stood by the shore alone in a daze, looking at the other side of the river with her eyes wide open.

The humans on the other side became even more excited, as if they had discovered the little girl. They waved their hands and shouted.

Chu Xiaoye rushed past the little girl with a whoosh and picked up Mixed Fur, who was on the ground, with his mouth, quickly escaping into the forest at the back.

"Bang—"

A bullet brushed past his mane and hit the tree in the forest.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled, but he did not put down Mixed Fur and dragged him into the forest.

On the other side of the river, the human cries became even louder. Their voices were filled with excitement, but there were no gunshots.

Chu Xiaoye hid in the forest and looked up. More than ten humans with guns were standing on the shore, waving at them and shouting excitedly for the little girl.

However, the little girl only hesitated for a few minutes before she suddenly turned around and ran towards the forest, shouting at the pride, "Run\! Humans\! There's a gun\!"

The humans on the other side of the river were clearly shocked.

Then, a few humans started to try to cross the river.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the little girl strangely and immediately dragged Mixed Fur on the ground and left quickly with the pride.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Another series of gunshots came from behind.

The fear in Chu Xiaoye's heart attacked wave after wave. Looking back, the humans were holding their guns and swimming in the river, shouting as they chased after him.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail's tail wrapped around Mixed Fur's body, making Chu Xiaoye's steps much lighter.

The big black bear carried the little girl on its back again and fled in panic.

The little girl looked back with a complicated expression, but her gaze was exceptionally determined.

Chu Xiaoye did not understand her thoughts at this moment. If she saw humans, why did she not join up with humans but escape with animals like them?

Could it be that in her heart, these ferocious beasts that ate raw meat made her feel more at ease and trust than those humans?

Could it be that she had completely given up on human life?

Chu Xiaoye did not want to think too much about this human girl. Now, he had to bring the pride and shake off this group of terrifying humans.

No matter how fierce they were, in front of the weapons of humans, they could only lie down and die.

Other than escaping, there was no other way.

The bloody holes on Mixed Fur's body were still flowing with blood. His fur was already dyed red and his heart was still beating. He had not completely stopped breathing.

Until now, his mind was still blank and he did not know what was happening.

He only knew that he had already suffered a fatal injury and was numb to the pain. He probably could not survive anymore. However, this young king did not abandon him.

"Bang—"

The human gunshots sounded behind him again.

The members of the pride trembled in fear.

Although they did not know what those upright and running animals were, the fact that Mixed Fur fell for no reason gave them extreme fear.

They knew that this terrifying sound represented death.

Therefore, they ran with all their might.

The continued pursuit of humans made Chu Xiaoye look at the little girl behind him again.

Perhaps those humans had passed by by chance and did not intend to do anything to lions like them. However, when those humans saw a human girl mixed in the pride, they would definitely think that the pride had captured this little girl, so they were destined to be in a sorry state.

Chu Xiaoye was considering whether to leave this little girl behind.

She belonged to the human race to begin with. There was no future if she followed their pride.

He would never allow his soft-heartedness to implicate the pride.

The little girl rode on the big black bear's back. Seeing him look over, she seemed to understand his thoughts and hurriedly shouted, "No\! King\! Don't leave me behind\! Those are bad people\! My parents were killed by them\! Please…"

Chu Xiaoye did not look at her again and continued to run forward.

"Bang—"

A gunshot\!

Bullets flew over and shot past the team\!

Belita, who was running, fell to the ground.

Belia, who was running beside her, jumped in fright and ran even faster.

Belita's father did not hesitate and immediately picked up his injured daughter with his mouth and continued to run.

The cries of another group of humans and dense gunshots suddenly sounded from the forest on the left.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the bleeding Belita and revealed a ruthless expression. He immediately turned around and ran towards the mountain peak not far away with the team.

Obviously, this group of humans did not come for the little girl.

Their goal was probably to kill\!

Qiqi and Nunu started to slow down. The cold father and the Chino brothers were about to collapse.

No matter what, they could not outrun the bullets.

The further they went, the slower they were.

They seemed to have been surrounded by those humans.

The bullets behind him were flying everywhere and the cries of humans rose and fell.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly put down Mixed Fur and let Little Curly Tail continue to escape up the mountain. He turned around and faced the humans behind him.

The little girl immediately cried out in fear, "King\! Don't go\!"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and continued to run back.

A familiar aura suddenly came from behind and followed him closely.

He did not need to look back to know that the stubborn lioness cub would always follow behind him.

"Whoosh\!"

His sharp golden claws suddenly pierced into the trunk of a big tree. He dug with all his might and half of the tree trunk fell.

"Bang\!"

With another hard slap, the entire tree fell.

He quickly swung his sharp claws and slapped three trees in a row, blocking the path behind.

Catherine immediately understood and started to slap the tree hard.

"Bang—"

A few bullets flew over and flew past her ear\!

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with a golden light. Seeing that the humans had already caught up, he immediately growled and fled with Catherine. Along the way, he waved his golden claws, and regardless of whether it was trees or bushes, he was caught on the ground.

This could reduce the speed of the humans chasing behind them, but it could not shake them off.

"Woof\! Woof woof\!"

Right at this moment, more than ten tall hunting dogs suddenly jumped out from the forest beside him\!

It turned out that these hunting dogs had never spoken. They quietly came close and prepared to attack them.

Not only were the ten-over hunting dogs tall, they were also extremely fierce. They were not frightened by the smell on their bodies. With their familiarity, or the owner behind them, they immediately roared and pounced.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine could have fled extremely quickly and ignored the pack of hounds.

However, Chu Xiaoye was suppressing his anger. Seeing that the humans behind him were quickly chasing after him, he did not escape immediately. Instead, he killed these dogs that relied on their status\!

Blood splashed and cries rang out endlessly\!

The ten-over hunting dogs that had been flaunting their might and roaring ferociously just now became corpses lying in pools of blood in the blink of an eye.

When the group of humans rushed over while panting, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine had long fled.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye heard the angry cries of humans and the exasperated gunshots from behind.

The group of humans did not give up and continued to chase.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and quickly caught up to the team. Seeing that the members of the pride were becoming slower and slower and that Mixed Fur and Belita's lives were in danger, he was secretly anxious.

"Buzz —"

Right at this moment, he suddenly heard a familiar buzz.
