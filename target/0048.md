Chapter 48: The New King

"Roar—"

The battle erupted again\!

The roars of the six female lions and the roars of the two wandering lions instantly resounded throughout the entire forest.

The animals in the forest fled in panic.

Not far away, Bill, who was lying on the ground, was covered in blood. He turned his head in despair and watched their battle.

No matter who won or lost, it no longer mattered to him.

His lion king career in this territory had completely come to an end.

And his life would be buried in this land.

On the grassland in the distance, the fiery red sun was slowly setting with its last light.

Just like his life.

The battle between the two wandering lions and the six female lions quickly ended.

Both sides did not intend to risk their lives.

The ferocity and courage of lionesses were for their children.

However, they did not want to die.

The two wandering lions had never thought of killing them.

Their battle with the lion king was for the territory and the female lions. Now that the lion king had lost, this territory and these female lions were theirs.

They only wanted to let the female lions know that they were stronger and more worthy of their support than their previous lion king\!

Both sides were injured.

The six female lions lost and admitted defeat first.

The two wandering lions could finally stop wandering at this moment.

They raised their heads and walked around the six terrified female lions, as if they were declaring their status as lion kings\!

Of course, there was only one Lion King.

Even brothers could only use battles to decide their leadership and mating rights.

However, this was not the time for brothers to fight.

The two brothers looked coldly at the young cubs.

The oldest cub was only eight months old. At this moment, it was shivering in the grass.

The two lions did not hesitate and rushed over\!

The six female lions trembled all over, their gazes sad and angry, but also filled with fear and helplessness.

They had already failed and had no choice but to accept this cruel outcome.

"Roar—"

The young cubs bared their fangs and trembled as they made their last struggle.

However, in front of the two huge monsters, their teeth and claws were useless.

The two lions cruelly bit them to death in front of their mothers and father who was about to die\!

Suddenly.

A lion looked up at the bushes.

Out of the seven cubs, one was missing.

Another one had already fled in a hurry when they defeated the female lions. It crossed the territory and escaped into another pride's territory.

The two lions raised their heads and looked coldly at the patch of bushes. It was another pride of lions that was already hiding in the bushes to watch their battle.

The cold father became nervous.

He really wanted to rush out and chase the lioness cub back, but he did not dare to show himself.

Looking at Bill's encounter, he was afraid.

These two young and strong lion brothers were stronger than he had imagined\!

The escaping lioness cub followed the dense bushes and came in front of them.

When she saw them standing there silently, she immediately stopped in her tracks and bared her sharp teeth. She let out a childish roar, her entire body trembling, and her big eyes were filled with fear.

The two victorious lions only looked over coldly for a while and did not chase after her.

They were also injured in the battle with Bill and the lionesses and did not want to have any conflict with the neighboring lions.

Furthermore, it was their time to enjoy the fruits of victory\!

They could not wait to brandish their scent on their territory and declare their sovereignty\!

Bill lay miserably on the grass not far away. Although he was seriously injured, he was still breathing.

He could last until midnight or even tomorrow.

But this would make him feel even more pain and torture.

Not only physically, but also mentally.

In the pain of slowly waiting for death, he watched the two enemies who killed him and his children flaunt their might in his territory, declaring their sovereignty, and even provoking his wives. He felt like dying\!

However, reality was so cruel.

"Roar—"

The excited and hoarse roars of the two lions came from the grassland.

As for the six female lions, they stood in the bushes in a daze, feeling sad for the children who died tragically.

The female cub that had luckily escaped was facing another form of fear of death—being sentenced to death by another pride for trespassing\!

Lion prides would never forgive any other lion that trespassed their territory.

Even if it was just a cub.

The lion, the cold father, let out a terrifying roar. His gaze was cold as he walked towards the pitiful lioness cub.

This female cub was at most six months old. At this moment, it could only show its sharp teeth. Its entire body was trembling as it made a pointless struggle.

She hid in the bushes and had already given up on escaping.

Because there was also a dead-end behind her.

Her mother was still there, but under the control of her desire to survive and fear, she had already given up on her.

Her fate was sealed the moment her father was defeated.

She trembled, terrified, and in despair.

The cold father's huge body walked over and covered her like a huge shadow of death.

She let out terrified whimpers, her eyes filled with a pitiful plea.

However, this was a joke to the cold father.

The cold father reached out with his huge claws and easily slapped her to the ground. Then, he opened his bloody mouth full of fangs and leaned over.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the pregnant Callie suddenly rushed up and roared angrily at the cold father.

Maya also rushed up and whimpered as if she was begging.

The two mothers who had lost their children seemed to be sad and when they saw this pitiful cub, they seemed to pity her.

The lion was obviously stunned and looked at them blankly.

Chu Xiaoye, who was standing on the tree, also looked at this scene in shock, finding it unbelievable.

However, his heart warmed slightly.

Silent motherly love always came so suddenly. Sometimes, it was even a little baffling.

"Roar—"

Callie continued to growl at the lion, using her body to protect the lioness cub.

Maya also walked over and stood beside her.

She seemed to think of her Gigi.

The lion, the cold father, looked at the faces of the two mothers who had lost their children for a few seconds before looking up at the two new neighbors through the bushes.

The two lions were excitedly using their urine to mark the borders, ignoring the fleeing lioness cub.

The cold father hesitated for a moment, lowered his head, and looked at the female cub again. Then, he turned around and left in silence.

He let her go.

However, this foreign little thing could forget about obtaining any food in his pride\!

He believed that after Callie and Maya gave birth, they would start to dislike this lioness cub.

She still could not escape the fate of death.

She would starve to death or be chased away and eaten by other carnivores alone\!

Lars looked at her disdainfully, turned around, and followed his father.

Another person was snatching food from him. Damn it\! His father should have bitten her to death\!

Although the lion had left, the female cub was still shivering in the grass.

Callie and Maya stood beside her, their gazes complicated. They seemed to only have pity and not motherly love.

After all, this was not their child.

The two female lions looked at her quietly for a while before leaving quietly as well.

They had only thought of their daughters when they saw her, which was why they had impulsively stopped the lion.

Now, they had already calmed down.

They were already pregnant or about to become pregnant. They needed to have enough food urgently. It was impossible for them to let a foreign cub share their precious food.

The little lioness was abandoned in the grass and no one bothered with her.

She had lost her home, her father and mother, and her siblings. Now, she was about to face endless loneliness and darkness, as well as all sorts of terrifying carnivores.

She turned around and looked at her home and mother for the last time. Then, she got up and followed the two female lions.

She had to live.
