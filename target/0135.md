Chapter 135: Smoke Ghost

"Cuckoo\! Cuckoo\!"

When he approached, the vultures hurriedly spread their wings and flew up, but they did not fly high.

Instead, he fell to the side and waited with a drooling gaze.

They thought that this cub wanted a share of the loot.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the wandering lion and stared at its still intact head and face for a while before heaving a sigh of relief.

It turned out that this was not Lars.

Although Lars was selfish and cold and did not like him, he was his brother after all.

If that fellow died miserably outside and happened to be seen by him, who was wandering, he would naturally feel uncomfortable.

This young wandering lion was thin and frail. Clearly, it had been hungry for a long time.

The reason why it died on the riverbed here might because it came here to look for food or water.

With its current size and strength, it would not have the strength to catch prey even if a prey stood in front of it.

With every meal it did not eat, it would become weaker and its chances of hunting would become slimmer. It would also be one step closer to death.

Therefore, to wandering lions, who had a shocking appetite but had no one to rely on, every meal was very important.

Otherwise, they would gradually go towards a vicious cycle of death.

Chu Xiaoye stared at the wandering lion for a while before turning around and looking at the small elephant following behind him.

Then.

If he was famished, he would never have any mercy. He would definitely eat this delicious meal that was courting death at the first moment\!

Before he became a true lion king and found a fertile territory for the pride, he had to survive.

He had to do whatever it took to survive\!

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly rushed out like lightning and bit the neck of a vulture. Then, he left with this unlucky vulture in his mouth.

The other vultures finally woke up and hurriedly flapped their wings to fly up, circling in midair in panic.

After he walked far away, they landed again and went in front of the young lion's corpse to eat.

Chu Xiaoye bit the vulture and tasted the blood flowing out of its neck. In this hot weather, his dry throat felt a little cool.

As for the little elephant, it still lowered its nose and followed behind him unhurriedly, as if it was waiting for him to eat at any time.

They walked for an entire day.

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye had already eaten the vulture in his mouth clean.

He was very thirsty now.

The hot sun, which was close to forty degrees, made his throat smoke and his mouth dry.

He urgently needed water.

Therefore, he stopped and turned around to look at the small elephant behind him.

Such a strong body must have a lot of blood stored in it, right?

This little elephant had been walking for so long. From yesterday to today, it seemed to not have eaten or drank water. How could it tolerate this?

Seeing that he had stopped and was staring at it coldly, the little elephant also stopped.

It stared at his eyes for a few seconds, then shook its nose and walked to the center of the riverbed.

It raised its heavy front feet and started to dig at the dry sand on the ground.

The surface of the riverbed was covered in a thick layer of mud. Under the sun, it was soft and hot.

What was it doing?

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before walking over.

Could it be that this little stupid elephant knew that it was about to die and was digging a hole for him so that he could bury its bones after eating and drinking its blood?

After the little elephant used its front feet to dig at the sand, it lowered its head and continued to dig at the sand with its long nose.

Chu Xiaoye stood nearby and was feeling puzzled when he suddenly saw that the sand it had dug out with its nose had become a little damp.

Then, mud actually appeared below.

After a moment, a pool of water suddenly appeared\!

Under this hot sand, there was actually still such clear river water hiding only dozens of centimeters away\!

Little Elephant sucked in a mouthful of water and swung it to the side. Water sprayed out and landed on Chu Xiaoye's head. His entire body immediately trembled. It was extremely cool\!

"Roar\!"

He immediately called out excitedly for it to continue\!

The little elephant slowly turned around, raised its nose, and pushed his butt.

It seemed to be saying, "Sure, but you have to fart first\!"

Chu Xiaoye was furious\!

This bastard actually used the dignified lion king's enemy weapon as a cigarette to smoke. It was too much\!

This was an insult to him\!

— Catch\!

"Pfft—"

He suddenly turned around, curled his tail, and sprayed black smoke at its nose.

It's just a fart. I have plenty\!

Brother\!

As long as there was water, there would be smelly farts\!

He had enough\!

The little elephant immediately narrowed its eyes and raised its nose to suck in the smelly black smoke. It was like an old smoker that had been smoking for decades. It was like it was riding the clouds while smoking a cigarette. Its tail swayed comfortably and its big ears trembled\!

Chu Xiaoye could not bear to look at it and looked elsewhere.

After a long time, the elephant finished smoking and finished reminiscing.

Then, it became excited and started to breathe water through its nose and spray it all over Chu Xiaoye.

After it sprayed a few times, Chu Xiaoye dared to open his mouth and drink this cold and sweet underground water.

Fortunately, there was no stench.

On the distant horizon, the sun that had tortured the grassland for the entire day finally hid half of its face. It was like a bastard who had finished doing something bad and wanted to sneak away. Before leaving, it still had to steal a glance.

Chu Xiaoye needed to find a safe place to sleep and replenish his energy.

Tomorrow, he still had to continue forward.

There was no sun at night, so it should be the best time to travel.

However, he could only travel during the day.

The grassland during the day was almost completely exposed to the sun. It was not covered at all. Standing in the distance, coupled with high-tech technology, he could see everything.

He did not want to be shot by those humans again while sleeping and be dragged away.

Furthermore, the day, when the temperature was high, was not a good time to rest.

He had to maintain the most stamina and spirit every day.

Otherwise, once danger arrived, no one could save him.

From the situation today, this little elephant was still useful.

Therefore, he would spare its life for now.

He left the riverbed and walked up the hill. He looked up at the west and, under the bright moonlight, saw a majestic mountain range standing on the distant horizon\!

The top of the mountain range almost touched the sky, as if it was a huge beast crawling in the night, contemplating the moon.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the river at the foot of the hill.

The river flowed upstream, winding and winding. If nothing went wrong, it led to that mountain range.

"Moo—"

Right at this moment, an extremely clear low-frequency cry suddenly came from the grassland not far away.

This was not the cry of a water buffalo, but an elephant\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he turned around and looked at the little elephant behind him.

However, this little elephant was like a big smoker who had just finished smoking but quickly became addicted to smoking. It raised its nose and started to rub his butt with a look of longing.
