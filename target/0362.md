Chapter 362: Untitled

The night quickly passed.

When the little girl woke up, the sky was already bright.

Bright sunlight shone through the gaps in the leaves and landed on the ground and her body.

Her slightly curled golden hair was filled with a gentle luster under the sun. Her fair and exquisite face still had a sleepy look after she woke up. Her snow-white dress was like a pure white flower that had bloomed and perfectly decorated the surrounding green.

She leaned against the tree and sat there quietly, like an exquisite oil painting that emitted a gentle and beautiful light under the sun.

Catherine, who had just woken up, lay in the grass at the side and looked at her in a daze.

At this moment, she seemed to understand why her king cared so much about this weak little animal.

If the noble and beautiful Tilly, who had snow-white fur, made her feel inferior, then the weak little animal in front of her made her feel even more ashamed.

She did not know what temperament and charm were, but at this moment, the scene in front of her, this little animal, made her involuntarily hold her breath and watch quietly and obsessively, appreciating, envying, and feeling inferior.

She was afraid of breaking this quiet and beautiful scene.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped down from the tree and rode on the little girl's neck, pressing her to the ground.

His golden mane was exceptionally beautiful under the sun.

The little girl cried out in fear and turned her head to look. Her face filled with shock immediately turned into a sweet smile. Her eyes were curved and she had bright eyes and white teeth.

Chu Xiaoye rode on her back and used his claws to push aside her skirt. He looked down at the wound caused by the venomous snake. The dark green color had already receded and there were even scars on it.

It seemed that his saliva was also effective in healing this little girl's wounds.

Chu Xiaoye was in a good mood. He patted her head with his claws and deliberately teased her, letting her carry him around.

The little girl took it seriously and immediately used all her strength. She puffed her cheeks and got up with all her might, but she realized that the fellow riding on her back was too heavy and she could not move at all.

Then, she turned around, her face red and her eyes wide. She looked at him pitifully, feeling a little ashamed.

He had done so much for her, but she could not do anything.

Chu Xiaoye laughed and raised his legs. He got down from her back and walked out of the bushes.

The morning wind was slow and the sun was bright.

On the grassland, the grass was lush and full of life.

It was another beautiful day.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and prepared to set off with the team. However, he realized that Little Curly Tail was still sleeping on the tree. Molly was also sleeping soundly in the bushes.

These two fellows had probably chased for the entire night and were now sleepy.

However, the team would never accommodate any member.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared sternly and woke Little Curly Tail and Molly up, urging them to set off.

Molly immediately opened her eyes, stood up, and followed behind Mei Mei. Her left and right ears had obvious teeth marks.

When Mei Mei looked over, the female cub immediately lowered her head like a shy girl.

It seemed that something had happened last night.

At least, the relationship between these two enemies was definitely one step closer.

Chu Xiaoye grinned and roared at Little Curly Tail on the tree again. This time, he was angry.

Little Curly Tail was extremely sleepy, but he did not dare to dawdle. He could only open his eyes with difficulty and jump down the tree, following after her with staggering steps.

There was a scratch on his face.

Molly turned her head and secretly looked at him. She immediately turned around and lowered her head, her eyes flickering.

Little Curly Tail did not look at her at all. He swung his tail and walked past her coldly and proudly.

Chu Xiaoye did not ask further and immediately set off with the team.

In order to reach the new territory as soon as possible, Chu Xiaoye did not pass through the territory of other prides fearlessly, afraid of causing unnecessary trouble.

After two baptisms of blood, the pride of this grassland had probably become even stronger and could not be viewed as before.

The members of the pride of the cold father did not have much combat strength on average.

When he first came here, he naturally had to return to his territory and manage it well before developing it slowly.

It would definitely be a disaster for the pride of the cold father to provoke the enemy so quickly.

For safety, Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry to travel. He walked and stopped along the way, maintaining a good combat strength for the pride.

Only on the evening of the third day did the familiar territory appear in his vision.

They stepped into the territory of the blue-eyed lions first.

However, the powerful blue-eyed lion king smelled an unfamiliar lion just as it walked into the territory.

Furthermore, this smell was especially left at the border.

This meant that this territory had already changed owners\!

A lion took advantage of his absence to occupy this territory and his lionesses\!

Furthermore, he killed his brothers and children\!

Blue Eyes burned with anger, but it did not make a sound and walked forward quickly.

Chu Xiaoye felt a little guilty and immediately brought the team and followed behind.

If he had not brought Blue Eyes to the other side of the mountain, with Blue Eyes's strength, this would not have happened.

Therefore, he could not ignore this matter.

Furthermore, although Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur each had their own pride and were not members of the pride of the cold father, at the end of the day, they were his subordinates who had once followed him and fought everywhere and made many contributions.

He had long treated them as members of his newly established pride.

Furthermore, Blue Eyes had long given this territory to him\!

At this moment, the sun had yet to set and all sorts of life and death battles were happening on the grassland.

A group of strong gnus were frightened and fled in all directions on the grass in front of them. Around them, a group of lions was chasing and blocking them.

Blue Eyes recognized a few female lions and immediately roared angrily before running over.

The pride that was hunting was immediately frightened by this murderous lion roar. They hurriedly stopped chasing their prey and stopped in place, looking up.

Blue Eyes' huge and strong body was exceptionally striking.

His fierce face full of scars and thick burgundy mane left a deep impression on the female lions.

Their king had won.

However, this territory had long changed owners, and they had long become the wives and concubines of other lion kings. They were even pregnant with the lion king's child.

The female lions immediately gathered in panic, bared their teeth, and roared at their lion king.

The waves pushed the waves, and the old king was replaced by a new king.

Although they still remembered this former lion king, they only had eyes for their new king.

Unless the new king was defeated or died.

The pride would not be nostalgic or loyal. Otherwise, the tribe would not have survived until now.

Facing Blue Eyes, the female lions did not hesitate to bare their fangs and wait solemnly. They no longer had the gentleness and care they had for this lion king in the past.

They had to protect their territory and the children in their stomachs.

Blue Eyes stopped two meters away from them and looked at them calmly, not showing any fierce expression.

Until a black-haired lion that was almost the same size as him ran over with five lions roaring.

Blue eyes looked at the six lions.

Obviously, the strong black-haired lion was the new lion king that had occupied the nest. The five lions behind him were his helpers.

The lion king's battle was not a one-on-one battle.

If the other party was a few brothers, you had to face a gang fight.

They would either retreat or die in battle.

Blue Eyes stood in place and narrowed his eyes, not retreating.

He only looked back.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and followed him, standing beside him.

Even Tilly, Catherine, Mei Mei, and the other female lions followed and prepared to fight beside him.

The female lions usually did not interfere in a lion king's battle.

But now, their members who had gone through trials and tribulations together while making their way here, including the two leopards, even the warthog and the honey badger, were a whole\!

They advanced and retreated together, sharing life and death\!

At this moment, Blue Eyes's blood immediately surged and he was in high spirits\!

The betrayal of the lionesses, the loss of his territory, and the death of the cubs. At this moment, these emotions that made him depressed seemed to be blown away by the evening breeze and disappeared into the distant setting sun.

He was not alone\!

The strong black-haired lion king stopped beside the female lions with the five lions. It looked at them fiercely, but it could not hide the fear in its eyes.

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur were of the same size as him and their auras were not weak. As for the Jerry brothers, they were even taller and stronger than him.

There were also the Chino brothers, the cold father, Chu Xiaoye, and Little Curly Tail. These lions looked at them provocatively and arrogantly, looking not afraid at all.

The female lions were clearly preparing to pounce on him and fight.

The black-haired lion king vaguely had the intention to retreat.

"Roar—"

However, the female lions beside him bared their fangs and let out angry roars, preparing to fight beside him.

A pregnant lioness would never tolerate a new lion king.

Although Blue Eyes was not a true new lion king but their old lion king.

However, they knew Blue Eyes's ferocious personality. Blue Eyes would never accept them bearing the children of other lions.

If the black-haired lion king was defeated, what awaited them would definitely be death\!

The black-haired lion king turned around and looked at their bulging stomachs. He hesitated for a moment before looking at Blue Eyes again, showing his fangs. His gaze was provocative as he issued the challenge of a duel.

1v1, whoever lost would scram\!

Blue Eyes' gaze was cold. He took a step forward and was about to accept the challenge when Chu Xiaoye suddenly took the lead and walked up to stand in front of the black-haired lion king.

He was the true king of this territory\!

Therefore, he should be the one to challenge\!

And the only one who would decide the life and death of this lion king and this group of female lions would be him\!

The black-haired lion king looked at him and was stunned for a moment, seemingly surprised.

Blue Eyes immediately understood. He did not hesitate and immediately took a step back, tacitly agreeing to his identity and rights.

This young lion king finally accepted him and his territory.
