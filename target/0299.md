Chapter 299: Golden Fur Lion King

The cold father naturally accepted this request gladly.

He could not wait to spread his scent on this territory.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and left quickly under the reluctant gazes of the elderly lions.

When the sun rose, another wandering pride came to seek refuge.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine checked personally, then let Lars and One-eyed bring them away and distribute them to various territories.

The team grew stronger every day.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the bushes and slept well.

In the evening.

On the distant border, Mei Mei and Molly's roars suddenly came, sounding a little anxious.

Chu Xiaoye woke up from his dream and immediately climbed down the tree, running away with Catherine.

Aisha and the others had already run out of the bushes.

Little Curly Tail, who was wandering nearby, was the first to arrive.

When he saw the scene on the grassland in front of him, he was first stunned, but then he immediately roared angrily, as if he was questioning something.

It was not the alarm of the black lion attacking. Therefore, only the members of the pride of the cold father heard the sound and rushed over.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine over quickly.

Mei Mei and Molly were fine and were standing together with Little Curly Tail, looking at the grassland in front of them in bewilderment.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw a group of young and strong lions standing there. There were about twenty of them.

They did not have black fur, but instead had brown fur like theirs.

Such a Lion Alliance was extremely rare on the grassland. Now, they were standing not far away and looking at this place covetously. No wonder Mei Mei and Molly's roars were a little anxious.

Was this the wandering lion alliance that had come to rely on them?

Obviously not.

Their fur was soft and glossy, their stomachs were bulging, and they were strong. Their food should be very good, and they did not look like they had nowhere to go.

At this moment, their aura and eyes seemed to be filled with hostility.

They stood 100 meters away and did not move forward, as if they were waiting for something.

Just as the members of the pride of the cold father were feeling puzzled, more figures suddenly appeared from the distant grassland and started to quickly approach this place.

They were densely packed and covered the grassland\!

Chu Xiaoye roughly counted, and there were at least 300 lions with brown fur.

He finally understood that this was another team gathered on the grassland. They should be like them, formed by the massacre of the black lions.

"Roar—"

Mei Mei suddenly let out an alarm. Her roar spread throughout the entire territory.

Soon, roars rose and fell in the other territories. All the prides started to gather here.

The Blue-eyes, Mixed Fur and the Jerry brothers ran over first.

Lars and One-eyed also rushed over with the team.

When they saw that the enemy opposite was not a black pride but another team like theirs, they were shocked.

Were they cornered by the black lions and coming to snatch their territory?

Dream on\!

The cold father brought the group of old lions and ran over aggressively, roaring like thunder.

They would rather die in battle than give up their territory\!

More than four hundred members, big and small, gathered behind Chu Xiaoye and looked at the pride opposite without fear.

Under the lead of the twenty-over lions, the pride opposite walked over majestically and stopped more than ten meters away.

They sized each other up.

Although Chu Xiaoye had more members than the other party, most of them were young cubs, old lions, and female lions. There were very few young and strong lions, and their combat strength was not strong.

Although the other party also had many young cubs and female lions, the number of young and strong lions was almost twice theirs and there were no old lions.

Obviously, the other party's combat strength was slightly stronger than theirs.

However, the outcome of the true battle was uncertain.

After all, Chu Xiaoye had more than 100 lions who had combat strength. And when those elderly lions went crazy, they were even more powerful than those young and strong lions.

Therefore, it was really difficult to say who would win.

The two sides faced each other and sized up their respective members. None of them did anything rash.

They were all members of the grassland, pitiful creatures who had been harmed by the black lions, had their homes broken, and had lost their homes. No one wanted to kill each other before they could reclaim their homes and chase away those enemies.

Of course, the prerequisite was that the other party did not go overboard.

The more lions gathered here, the more food they needed and the territory they needed. Therefore, Chu Xiaoye would never make any concessions.

Suddenly, the opposite pride automatically separated and made way.

Then, a young lion with golden fur walked out of the team with four tall lions.

When they saw this young golden-haired lion king, Chu Xiaoye's pride was stunned and they looked at their king.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but look at the lion king again, then turned to look at the fur on his body. He sighed inwardly. This was a true golden-haired lion king\!

As for him, he was at most a golden-bearded lion king.

The young golden-haired lion king was taller than him and looked more imposing than him. It was more like a high and noble king.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was in a daze, Catherine, who was standing behind him, suddenly took a step forward and leaned on him, rubbing her head against the golden fur on his neck.

The female cub was telling him that he was the only king\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart warmed. He raised his claws and rubbed her head, indicating that he did not need to be comforted. He did not take this small matter to heart.

He did not like golden fur. It was too dazzling and too high profile.

The brown lions could hide in the withered grass, the black lions could hide in the dark night, the white lions could hide in the white snow mountain, and the golden lions could only stand under the golden sun to make themselves look more beautiful and conspicuous.

What was the use\!

The bird that sticks out gets shot\!

"Hmph\!"

Chu Xiaoye snorted from his nose, but his gaze was a little jealous as he looked at the fellow covered in bright light.

"Roar—"

At this moment, Tilly, who was standing on his right, suddenly roared and looked infatuatedly at the young lion king. She even slapped his butt with her tail.

"Wow\! smelly fart king\! Did you see that? That's the true golden-haired lion king. You're an impostor\!"

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and glared.

This female cub was asking for a beating\!

At this moment, the young golden-haired lion king brought the four guards close and stopped two meters away from their border, looking at them with a burning gaze.

Then, his gaze finally stopped on Chu Xiaoye.

When he saw the golden fur on Chu Xiaoye's neck, he was stunned at first. Then, he narrowed his eyes and revealed a thoughtful expression. However, he did not mock him and lowered his head very politely.

"You're the king here, right? I'm sorry for disturbing you today. Please forgive me."

Chu Xiaoye realized that although this fellow seemed to be looking at him, he would glance at the little white lion on his right from time to time.

As for Tilly, she revealed an infatuated expression, like a little fangirl who had seen her idol. She was already dizzy and her body leaned against his.
