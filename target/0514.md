Chapter 514: The Queen and Lord Night

Denise was very fast.

More than 100 archers soon followed orders and rushed over.

However, what surprised and worried Chu Xiaoye was that the hundred-over archers, including Denise, were all girls. There were also a few especially striking little girls.

Most of the elves died in battle.

The older ones followed closely behind the man and died one after another.

The entire elven race was now filled with Yin and Yang, and there were only lone women and widows left. Almost no family was complete.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the girls in front of him who were still childish but had bright eyes and determined expressions. His heart suddenly felt a little heavy.

If possible, he did not want anyone here to die in this battle.

"Denise, can you lend me your bow?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the silver-haired girl and extended his hand.

He thought that the other party would hand the icy blue jade bow on his back over without hesitation, but the other party did not.

He seemed to have underestimated the status of the Jade Bow in the heart of this elf girl.

Denise said to an elf girl with pink hair, "Fei'er, bring your bow over."

The elf girl named Fei'er immediately walked in front of Chu Xiaoye and handed over the bow in her hand.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her pink waist-length hair, but he did not extend his hand to take it. Instead, he still looked at the silver-haired girl and said, "Denise, His Majesty said that anything I say now is an order\!"

He emphasized with a serious expression.

Because if his words still did not work or if no one was afraid and obedient, the following battle would be very dangerous.

His previous efforts might be wasted.

Denise was silent for a moment before walking in front of him. She took down the jade bow on her back and handed it to him. She whispered, "Be careful."

Chu Xiaoye was puzzled and reached out to take it. Just as his fingertips touched the jade bow's arm, he suddenly felt an electric current attack from the jade bow. At the same time, a bone-chilling coldness instantly passed through his fingertips and surged into his body.

He suddenly retracted his hand and trembled coldly.

"Pfft—"

The pink-haired girl named Fei'er could not help but laugh. She hurriedly covered her mouth and could not help but say, "Lord Night, only she can take Sister Denise's bow. You should use mine."

Her voice was very sweet and soft.

Chu Xiaoye waved his hand with an embarrassed expression. He could only take her bow and say to the silver-haired girl begrudgingly, "Denise, you can say a few more words."

She could explain this situation to him.

Denise lowered her head and said, "Yes."

Chu Xiaoye sighed and took out an arrow from Fei'er's quiver. He raised it and said, "Everyone, watch carefully\! When I give the order, the arrows you shoot must be arrows like mine and not the arrows you usually shoot."

With that said, he placed the tip of the arrow into a jar of oil that he had long prepared and soaked it. Then, he took a few steps away and lit the torch on the ground. He placed it on the bowstring and pulled the bowstring to shoot. With a whoosh, the arrow shot down the canyon.

The tip of the iron arrow carried flames and instantly fell into the canyon below, still burning.

However, at the bottom of the canyon, Vilis suddenly cried out in shock, "Who shot that? Who shot that? There's someone down here\!"

Her dress was on fire.

The fire arrow pierced her dress and almost hit her butt, scaring her.

Chu Xiaoye's expression froze for a moment. He hurriedly retreated behind the stone and hid. He popped his head out to look at the female elves and said, "Do you see that? Light it up and shoot again. The arrows that are shot must have flames, understand?"

"Understood\!"

This was very simple\!

To an archer, igniting a flame was not much different from not having any flames.

Denise looked at him in a daze, as if she had never thought of shooting arrows like this before.

"Alright, everyone can go and practice, but remember not to let the torch go near the oil barrel\!"

Chu Xiaoye reminded carefully.

At this moment, a voice came from the foot of the hill. "Remember, before shooting the arrow, see if there are enemies below\!"

Vilis climbed up angrily. A black hole appeared in her silver short skirt and her perky butt was revealed. She glared at him.

Chu Xiaoye walked out from behind the rock and immediately said to Denise, "Yes, remember what Lady Vilis said. Before shooting the arrow, you have to look down. Denise, look at you. Why didn't you look down when you demonstrated to everyone just now? Hurry up and apologize to Lady Vilis."

Denise looked at him in a daze.

This pure and quiet elf girl was already shocked by his shamelessness.

"Stop pretending\!"

Vilis glared at him even more angrily. "I know Denise's arrow\! If she had shot it, I would have died long ago\! You still have Fei'er's bow in your hand. Do you think I'm blind?"

The pink-haired elf girl covered her mouth and secretly laughed.

Chu Xiaoye revealed an embarrassed expression. He walked over and returned the bow in his hand to her. He changed the topic and said, "Has this Miss Fei'er's hair been dyed? I think most of your elves' hair seems to be silver."

Fei'er immediately giggled and could not straighten her back.

Vilis still glared at him angrily.

"I was born with it."

The pink-haired girl stopped laughing and circled the pink hair in front of her chest with her slender fingers. She said sweetly, "There are many people in our elven race who have hair that is not silver at birth. For example, Her Majesty, Doris, Mona, Youya, and so on were all born with other colors."

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the archer girls and realized that he was too short to see them.

He could only walk to the stone at the side and jump up. He tiptoed to look. Indeed, among the more than 100 female archers, many had hair that was not silver and had all sorts of colors.

Chu Xiaoye now suspected that the ancestors of these elves were probably cultivated by all sorts of plants and beautiful flowers. Otherwise, why were the colors so colorful?

"Shorty\!"

Vilis mocked again before turning to leave.

She had to go back and change.

"Could she not be short?"

After she left, Chu Xiaoye spread his hands and complained to the archer girls in front of him.

Everyone laughed, but they covered their mouths, afraid that Lady Vilis, who had yet to walk far away, would hear them.

"Alright, everyone, go back. Just like I said before, get into position. Don't forget your positions. Also, you have to practice what I just demonstrated. Although it's not difficult for everyone, I don't want any problems with the fire arrow you shot when the battle begins."

Chu Xiaoye stood on the rock and said solemnly.

"Yes\! Lord Night\!"

The girls dispersed with their bows.

The pink-haired girl was about to leave when Denise suddenly said, "Fei'er, stay."

Fei'er immediately stopped and blinked her big eyes. "Sister Denise, what's the matter?"

This girl was also very tall, at least 1.72 meters. She was probably only 14 or 15 years old and was a little younger than Denise. She was beautiful and looked very lively.

Denise looked at her and said, "You're very good at archery. Stay here and protect Lord Night with me."

"Really?"

When Fei'er heard that, her eyes immediately lit up and she looked happy. She looked at Chu Xiaoye and smiled. "I'm so happy to be able to protect Lord Night."

This young man had already proven himself last night and given them hope to live. Being able to follow beside him and protect him was something that every elf here felt honor and happiness.

"Lord Night, Fei'er will definitely protect you well\!"

The girl bowed solemnly. Her eyes were bright like stars and the happy smile on her face could not be wiped away.

What a pure and kind child\!

However, Chu Xiaoye frowned and looked at Denise.

Was she protecting him or spying on him?

In fact, he also understood that this battle concerned the fate of the entire elven race, and he was the most crucial one in this battle. All the elves would listen to him. If something happened to him, or he suddenly fled at the last moment, or even suddenly switched sides, it would be troublesome.

"Alright, I'll treat you as air."

Since the other party insisted on doing so, he could not refuse anymore, lest he was treated as having a guilty conscience.

In the evening, Queen Lanisi finally brought over exquisite food with her subordinates.

The food of the elves was mostly snacks and were all sweet. However, this sweetness was sweet and natural. Most of them were made of nectar. When they ate it, not only did they not feel greasy, they also became more and more delicious. They could not stop eating.

Chu Xiaoye wolfed down the food and said, "Your Majesty, it's delicious, but I still like to eat meat. Is there meat?"

Lanisi was a little embarrassed. "We don't usually eat meat. Only a few people occasionally try it, so the kitchen is not prepared."

Chu Xiaoye let out a roar and said, "Your Majesty, don't forget that I'm a lion. Even if it's alive, I can still eat it. For example, pigs, cows, sheep, horses, and so on. Get some over."

The queen hesitated, her gaze averted. “Night,” she whispered. “Horses are like friends to us. I can't let you eat them. We don't have any of the other animals, but… but there are still orcs in the cell. Do you want to…”

"Of course not\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately refused, feeling a little disgusted.

Although he was a lion and could eat any flesh, he had a human soul after all. Now that he had become an elf, there were some things that he could not swallow.

The Queen lowered her head and felt a little guilty.

This young man had worked hard for so many days and made so many contributions to the elves. However, as the king of the elves, she could not let him eat his fill and be happy. Therefore, she was especially sad and ashamed.

"Night, why don't I pull my horse over…"

The Queen lowered her thick eyelashes, and her gaze trembled. She bit her pink lips and felt like she was about to cry, but she did not hesitate anymore. She pleaded, "However, please don't… Don't eat her in front of me, okay?"

Looking at her pitiful and pained expression, Chu Xiaoye felt that he had done something extremely evil.

"Your Majesty, I was just joking with you."

He smiled and picked up the last snack, stuffing it into his mouth. As he ate, he said, "These snacks are enough. They're delicious, and I like them very much. When this battle is won, I hope Your Majesty can get someone to make more of these snacks for me and let me eat enough."

Lanisi heaved a sigh of relief and nodded heavily. "Yes\! Night, I'll definitely let you eat enough."

"Thank you, Night."

She actually knew that this young man was not joking. When lions ate meat, they were like elves eating nectar. Their natural preferences could not be changed.

"When there's a chance, I'll let Dolma catch some prey for you outside and let you eat enough."

She said gratefully.

Chu Xiaoye smiled and did not speak.

There should be no chance.

After this crisis was resolved, he should leave with Catherine.

Although this place was beautiful, it was not his home and he would definitely not have any freedom.

After the world settled, the supreme queen would definitely recover her noble and proud identity. How could she treat him like this now? Most of the meritorious ministers in history had finished hiding and gotten rid of the rabbit after it died. Their end was miserable.

Power was a demon. It could change its appearance or make its former friends and family turn against each other and fight.

He was an outsider and an elf that had transformed from a lion. No matter how outstanding he was, he was only a guest. The more outstanding he was, the more afraid some people would be.

Chu Xiaoye was familiar with history and would naturally not miss the whirlpool of this authority and the dance floor of the demons.

After dark.

Dark clouds suddenly covered the sky. There was no moon or stars.

The night sky was muddy and even the wind that blew was a little cold.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the sky and suddenly had an ominous feeling.

Could it be that it was going to rain?

He suddenly thought of Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi's last battle. Under the situation of certain death, Sima Yi suddenly obtained the help of the heavens. A heavy rain fell and he finally escaped.

Could it be that history would repeat here?

Although the fire oil was not so easy to extinguish, if it really rained, his plan to catch all the orcs here would definitely fail. At that time, what awaited them would be their more ferocious revenge.

Whether he could leave or not was still unknown.

If the rain was too strong, they would not even be able to shoot fire arrows.

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye was worried and uneasy.

At this moment, he hoped that the orcs would be faster and enter this canyon sooner.

"Night, what's wrong?"

Lanisi saw his frustration and uneasiness and immediately felt uneasy.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to affect their morale, let alone pour cold water on their newly ignited hope. He was not sure if it would rain yet. Perhaps he was just worrying unnecessarily.

"I want to be quiet."

Chu Xiaoye did not want to speak or show too many worried emotions.

"Who is Jingjing? Is she a lioness cub like Catherine?"

The Queen suddenly said an awkward and old-fashioned joke.

Of course, she did not mean to. She had never heard this joke.

She asked very seriously and carefully.

Chu Xiaoye could not laugh and said solemnly, "It's a beautiful girl like Your Majesty."

The Queen suddenly grabbed her hand and leaned close to him. She said gently, "Night, then, you can close your eyes and rest. I'll sit beside you. You can treat me as her."

Beside him, Denise turned around and looked elsewhere.

The pink-haired girl named Fei'er widened her bright eyes and looked on curiously and in shock. She thought to herself, Her Majesty is so good to Lord Night. If Her Majesty can really become a couple with Lord Night, our Elf Kingdom will no longer be afraid of orcs.

Chu Xiaoye wanted to pull his hand out, but he did not know how to explain. He could only hold her delicate hand and lean against the stone wall at the back. He closed his eyes, wanting to calm down.

The Queen sat down beside him and slowly leaned against him.

They held each other's hands until dawn.

After the sun rose, Chu Xiaoye woke up. He was wearing the Queen's red robe and the scent of a young girl was still lingering in his hand.

The Queen brought Vilis and the guards to the frontline to check the situation.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the clear sky and the bright sun. He suddenly jumped up from the ground and shouted, "When the sun comes out, I'll climb the hill. When I climb to the hill, I want to sing. Let my sister hear my singing. When she hears it, she'll laugh…"

He was really in a good mood, as if he had survived a disaster.

However, his sudden jump and cries not only frightened Denise and Fei'er, but also Catherine, who was lying beside him. She shivered and almost peed her pants.

"Aiya, Lord Night, what are you doing? You scared me to death\!"

The pink-haired fairy girl rubbed her chest, her heart jumping in fear. She had a resentful expression.

Chu Xiaoye laughed and tied the queen's red robe at his waist. He started to patrol every section of the hill and took the initiative to greet the archers and soldiers. Almost none of them fell.

Everyone was flattered and joked happily and boldly.

"Lord Night, why are you so happy? Is it because of our queen? I heard that last night, you slept with our queen and were even holding hands."

"I heard that you've already secretly kissed our queen, right? Lord Night is so mighty\!"

"I even saw Lord Night kiss the Queen's ears and cheeks yesterday."

"Really?"

"Of course\! It's true\! I saw it with my own eyes\! Her Majesty looked so shy and happy at that time. It was the first time I saw her show that expression."

"Wow\! It turns out that our queen has long had a crush on Lord Night\!"

"Then we definitely did not just hold hands last night\! Lord Night, quickly tell us what you did to our queen last night? If you don't tell us, we'll ask the queen."

No matter how thick Chu Xiaoye's skin was, he was embarrassed by the question. He hurriedly said loudly, "Everyone, don't talk nonsense\! Nothing happened between me and your queen\! I didn't kiss her or do anything wrong. I was just chatting. Everyone, don't spoil her reputation."

"Hehe, Lord Night still wants to pretend."

"Lord Night is blushing."

"Lord Night is still wearing the Queen's clothes on his waist. He must have done something bad to our Queen last night\!"

"Yes\! Yes\!"

Everyone laughed and continued to jeer.

Chu Xiaoye could only walk forward quickly and pretend that he did not hear it. He sighed inwardly. He did not expect women in the world to tell fortunes like humans and elves.

The three bridges of the orcs advanced quickly and reached the middle of the cliff.

Queen Lanisi stood on the hill, facing the sun. Her red hair fluttered as she looked ahead, her blue eyes filled with worry.

Chu Xiaoye's emotions last night infected her.

Now, looking at the dense orc army on the three bridges, how could she not be worried?

Vilis and Loli were behind her with grave expressions.

Chu Xiaoye stopped not far behind them and suddenly turned around. He looked at Denise and Fei'er, who were following behind him, and said, "I didn't care at first, but now, seeing the difference in height between the Queen and Vilis, I suddenly care. Others should be looking at the three of us like I'm looking at the Queen and Vilis now, right?"

Vilis was at most 1.47 meters tall, and the queen was slightly taller than Fei'er and slightly shorter than Denise. She was about 1.74 meters tall, slender, and had a proud figure.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the scene of the two of them standing together, his heart twitching.

Because he suddenly thought of himself and the two tall girls behind him.

He was even shorter than the huge sword loli and was at most 1.43 meters tall. Now, there were two young girls taller than 1.7 meters behind him. Could he be happy?

"By the way, can I grow taller?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the two girls behind him and could not help but ask.

Fei'er smiled and nodded. "Yes, Lord Night. You're only 17 years old at most. You can definitely grow taller."

"17… 17? Am I that old?"

Chu Xiaoye touched his face and asked, "How old are you?"

Fei'er grinned and said, "Fourteen years old. I just turned fourteen this year."

Chu Xiaoye immediately felt despair. He looked at Denise and said, "What about her? How old is she?"

Fei'er thought for a moment and said, "Sister Denise is the same age as Her Majesty the Queen. She should be seventeen too."

Chu Xiaoye felt even more desperate.

Damn, they were also elves. How did they grow up\!

"What about Vilis? How old is she?"

Fortunately, there was still Vilis who was short with him. The girl's chest was so unrestrained that she was not inferior to the Queen and Denise. She was probably eighteen or twenty years old long ago. She was just young and definitely did not have a chance to grow taller.

Unexpectedly, Fei'er smiled and said, "Lady Vilis is the same age as me. She just turned 14 this year."

"Ah\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately felt like breaking down.

That girl was only 14 years old. She could definitely grow taller, but he might not.

They had agreed to be short together. How could she still have a chance to grow taller secretly?

Chu Xiaoye wanted to rush over and break her legs, causing her to lose all hope of growing taller\!

"Shortie, why are you looking at me sneakily?"

Vilis seemed to have sensed something and turned around, meeting his gaze.

The little lolita changed into a pink dress again. She wore pink and white striped socks on her legs and a pair of pink short boots on her feet. She also wore a pink bow on her hair. She dressed like a little cutie, but the expression on her face was like that of a little b\*tch.

"Which eye of yours saw me peeping at you? I was looking at Her Majesty\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not show any weakness and was furious. He was suppressing his anger. He had a grievance as though he wanted to be poor with her but she suddenly became rich.

"I saw it with both my eyes\!"

Vilis opposed with equal harshness.

Chu Xiaoye held the sword hilt and said angrily, "If you continue to be noisy, I'll break your short legs\!"

Vilis chuckled and also held her sword hilt. "Come on, let's see who breaks whose short legs first\!"

With that said, she raised her legs provocatively and said, "Shorty, although I'm also short, I'm at least taller than you. Furthermore, my figure is uniform. Overall, my two legs are still quite slender. As for you? Heh heh, they're long on the top and short on the bottom. They're so deformed\!"

This time, Chu Xiaoye was really shocked. He covered his chest and staggered a few steps before falling on Denise's chest and being bounced up again.

"Vilis\! I order you to come and take my punch\!"

Chu Xiaoye said angrily.

Vilis snorted coldly. Just as she was about to ridicule him, Lanisi hurriedly stood between the two of them and said with a smile, "Alright, alright. Don't quarrel the moment you see each other. I'm taller than you two, so you have to listen to me."

Chu Xiaoye covered his chest again and took a few steps back. Then, he fell, but he fell to the ground with a thud this time.

He turned around and saw that the tall silver-haired girl was already standing behind Fei'er at some point in time.

Fei'er was covering her mouth and laughing.

"Your Majesty\! Another Orc army has appeared in the snow forest\!"

Right at this moment, an elf soldier rushed over and said with a pale face.

The expressions of everyone changed and they hurriedly walked towards the hill in front.

Standing on the hill, he looked opposite. Although he could not see clearly, he could still see another group of orcs rushing to the cliff from the depths of the snow forest.

Lanisi's expression was grave and her hand that was holding the sword hilt turned slightly white.

Chu Xiaoye walked to her side and looked up. His eyes flickered with golden light as he looked clearly at the orc army in the snow forest.

After a long time, he retracted his gaze and sighed. "Almost ten thousand orcs have come again. Furthermore, they brought thicker and larger shields this time. There was a team of orcs who were taller and stronger than the orcs who used their bodies to block the iron arrows on the bridge previously."

Everyone's expressions turned exceptionally ugly when they heard this.

Princess Annie walked over and looked ahead. "There are about 100,000 orc troops in the Bolton Kingdom. Most of them are guarding the borders in other directions to guard against the sneak attacks of other orc countries. The sudden dispatch of 20,000 this time is clearly because they want our Elven Kingdom."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and asked in confusion, "There are other orc countries?"

Annie nodded and said, "Of course. Other than the Bolton Kingdom, there are also more than twenty orc countries of all sizes. They are constantly in war all year round. Every country wants to annex neighboring countries, and every country wants to unite all the orc countries, but they have never succeeded. The Bolton Kingdom is the closest to us, so most of the enemies that are fighting us elves are from this country. Other countries have also sent troops over, but there won't be more than ten thousand people each time. Those countries only want to abduct some elves and return, and they have never thought of destroying us completely. But the Bolton Kingdom is different. They have always wanted to take over our country and completely make us elves their slaves."

Chu Xiaoye sighed in sympathy. "You're pitiful. Living here, living in a corner with no desires but no peace. Who did you provoke?"

Lanisi sighed and said, "Actually, we did provoke them first."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in shock.

Annie frowned and said, "Sister should not have said that. Those who provoked them were not our clansmen. Those elves have long had nothing to do with us."

Chu Xiaoye was more and more curious. "Which elves are those?"

A bitter expression appeared on Lanisi's face as she slowly said, "In the past, there were hundreds of thousands of us elves. In the end, because of all sorts of differences and conflicts, we split into three waves. The first wave went to the human world and merged with humans, building a new country and growing more and more prosperous. The second wave went to another place, far away from the orc countries and humans. It had been a long time since we heard about them. The third wave was us. We still stayed here to protect the holy land and never left. The first wave of elves who formed hatred with the orcs was the first wave. They slaughtered the orcs, enslaved the orcs, and snatched the orcs' territory and resources. It was very cruel. Hence, the orcs counted all their hatred and anger on all the elves. We were the closest to them and the weakest, so they always bullied us."

Chu Xiaoye did not know how to comfort them after hearing this. He sighed and said, "Although there's a natural barrier here, it's not a safe place. There are only more than a thousand of you left. There's no need to wait here for death. I think that if you win this battle, you can leave together and live in a place that neither the orcs nor humans can find. That's what your ancestors want to see, and not die tragically to protect this place."

Vilis held her sword and said, "We won't leave\! Even if we die, we will die here\!"

Annie also shook her head and said, "More than 1,000 people, not many and not few. If we walk on the road, we'll be easily discovered and surrounded by the orcs. At that time, I'm afraid none of us will survive."

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "That's better than staying here and waiting for death, right?"

Annie suddenly looked at him and said, "Don't we still have you? As long as you're here, we have hope. I believe you can lead the thousand of us to survive."

Seeing that they were all looking at him with bright eyes, Chu Xiaoye immediately felt a sense of heaviness in his heart and almost could not breathe.

His expression was ugly. He hesitated for a moment and went straight to the point. "Sorry, Annie. After this battle ends, I want to…"

"Night, are you confident in this battle?"

The Queen suddenly interrupted him and asked him with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the distant orc army and was silent for a moment before saying, "If nothing goes wrong, we should be able to win. That twenty thousand orc army will never return\!"

With that said, the surroundings fell silent.

The girls looked at him with different expressions.

There was shock, doubt, excitement, worry, disbelief, trust, and joy.

"Night, please."

The Queen lowered her head and bowed deeply.

Hence, no one mentioned Chu Xiaoye's unfinished words again.
