Chapter 123: Battle of the Lions

No matter how chaotic the world was, they still had to eat.

To the animals on the grassland, nothing was more important than having a full stomach.

Under the lead of the cold father, the pride climbed over the hill and continued to look for prey in the boundless night.

Chu Xiaoye had a sharp knife in his mouth.

Little Curly Tail had a bow in his mouth.

Catherine and Mei Mei had two bags of arrows in their mouths.

They had plucked these from the corpses when they had just left.

Of course, this was Chu Xiaoye's idea.

He had to kill that tiger\!

No matter what happened in the human world, it was temporarily unrelated to them.

However, the tiger in the bushes could take their lives at any moment\!

As long as it threatened the safety of the pride, he would never show mercy to anyone\!

The cold father looked at them as if he was looking at idiots.

The trash in their mouths could not be eaten and was not as sharp as claws and teeth. Were they full or were they too hungry?

A group of little idiots\!

"Roar—"

Just as they passed through the dry swamp, they suddenly heard a roar in front of them\!

The cold father and the female lions were shocked\!

They had heard this roar before\!

Not far ahead, two lions and a group of female lions stood there like bandits blocking the way. Pairs of dark eyes stared at them coldly.

They seemed to be saying, "I opened this road and planted this tree. If you want to pass by, leave your prey behind\!"

They had already waited for a long time here.

That night the cold father and the female lions went out to hunt and returned injured, they had a conflict with this pride.

Due to the disadvantage in numbers, they lost on the spot and fled.

Unexpectedly, they encountered each other again and faced each other as enemies\!

From the looks of it, they were waiting for them specifically and preparing to rob them.

However, they also returned empty-handed.

The cold father and the female lions were furious when they saw this scene, but they immediately stopped in place and did not dare to move forward.

The other party had two adult lions and seven adult female lions. The difference in strength was huge. The crushing defeat and sorry state that night was still fresh in their memories.

Their kind usually did not eat their own kind.

However, there were exceptions.

Any animal would lose their rationality and rules when they were extremely hungry.

The cold father turned his head subconsciously and looked at the little idiots behind him. Oh, no, it was the little sweethearts.

These were his sons and daughters. He believed that they would definitely help him.

This was without a doubt\!

Wasn't it natural for a father to raise children and the children to help their father?

"Roar—"

The cold father's courage increased as he looked fiercely at the lion. He let out a fearless roar filled with provocation\!

It was as if he was saying, "Come on, bastards\! This King's children are made of dough. You have to use more strength\!"

The female lions looked at him in shock.

The two lions opposite immediately flew into a rage. They roared and walked over with the seven female lions with a murderous aura.

The cold father immediately turned around and looked at his two obedient sons.

However, the two obedient sons were lying on their side with something in their mouths. They were looking at the distant night and thinking about lion life.

Unfilial son\!

These two unfilial sons\!

The cold father was shocked, angry, anxious, and afraid, but he had no choice but to harden his head and bare his fangs, preparing to welcome the anger of the two adult lions.

His responsibility was to protect the pride\!

Even if there was a huge disparity in strength and the other party had two adult lions, he had to fight bravely until the last moment\!

"Roar—"

The two adult lions immediately bared their fangs and pounced ferociously\!

The eyes of the seven adult female lions behind them also shone as they pounced over\!

They were hungry\!

At this critical moment, the cold father hurriedly roared at the female lions behind him, turned around, and fled to the side with them\!

In this situation, if they did not run, they would die\!

This was an animal's instinct\!

However, when they ran a few meters away, they suddenly realized that the four little idiots were still standing in place with the trash in their mouths, as if they were continuing to think about lion life or were scared silly.

"Roar—"

The cold father roared angrily, as if he was urging them.

These idiots did not attack or run. Were they courting death?

Xi'er and Aisha immediately stopped and turned to return.

The two adult lions and the seven female lions stopped in front of the four little cubs in confusion and looked at them in bewilderment.

What were these little fellows biting?

They did not look like prey.

What were they doing? Were they scared silly?

Who cares\!

They would talk about it after eating\!

"Roar—"

The two adult lions and the seven female lions immediately pounced over with drool all over their faces\!

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and put down the knife in his mouth.

When Little Curly Tail saw this, he lowered his head and put down the bow in his mouth.

Mei Mei and Catherine also lowered their heads and put down the arrows in their mouths.

Their eyes lit up and they were even more excited.

Especially Little Curly Tail. He was so excited that his entire body was trembling and his tail was wagging.

They had already waited for a long time\!

He had not fought with his own kind for a long time\!

Tonight, he was finally going to get what he wanted\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail suddenly roared angrily and pounced at an adult lion with a whoosh\!

These two adult lions were his. No one could snatch them\!

Whoever snatched it from him would get it from him\!

"Whoosh—"

Unexpectedly, a figure ran faster than him and instantly passed him, pouncing on the two adult lions\!

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Two muffled sounds\!

The two adult lions that were charging over ferociously immediately tilted their heads and staggered to the side. They fell to the ground with their heads buzzing and could not get up for a long time\!

Chu Xiaoye landed lightly on the ground. His feet were slightly hot and he felt especially refreshed.

Although he no longer had claws, his strength was much greater.

His slaps were even smoother and more powerful\!

Little Curly Tail stopped in his tracks and froze in place. He was anxious and let out a roar to show that his feelings were hurt\!

At this moment, Mei Mei and Catherine had already rushed in front of the seven female lions. They jumped quickly and brandished their claws. In a moment, they had scratched the seven female lions until their heads were bleeding and their bodies were covered in blood\!

Little Curly Tail was even more anxious. He hurriedly rushed over, swung his tail, and swung his claws. He scratched the female lions until they swayed and cried out miserably. They pissed their pants\!

After a while, the two adult lions that were charging over aggressively and the seven adult female lions all fell to the ground miserably, defeated\!

They were terrified and confused, not knowing what was happening.

It was too fast\!

They were too pervertedly strong\!

Were these really just a few underage cubs?

"Damn, why does this King suddenly feel like his head is a little green?"

The stunned cold father raised his claws and rubbed his head stiffly.
