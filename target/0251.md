Chapter 251: Little Curly Tail's Tail

"Roar—"

The lion's roar sounded in the quiet night\!

The six members of the Mafia Alliance, who made the prides tremble in fear, immediately roared and rushed up.

Even if the Nuka brothers did not escape to this territory, they would still invade.

The cold father knew.

Little Curly Tail knew better.

Therefore, they could only fight\!

The cold father roared angrily and attacked first, pouncing on the lion with the thickest mane\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei followed closely.

The other female lions roared and attacked\!

The battle instantly started\!

Mei Mei rushed towards the young lion that was provoking her. Her claws flickered with a light blue cold light, looking rather demonic in the night\!

The young lion suddenly jumped up and pounced at her.

He decided to conquer this beautiful and unique lioness cub\!

"Whoosh\!"

A cold light flashed\!

Light blue claws grabbed at the young lion's face\!

The young lion was frightened by her lightning-like movements and hurriedly stopped its pounce. It tilted its head back and landed on the ground.

However, the sharp claws still brushed past his face\!

A sharp pain suddenly assaulted his face\!

Blood splashed\!

Half of his face was actually grabbed off\!

"Roar—"

The young lion let out a miserable roar and was shocked and furious. He no longer had any intention to be protective of the fairer sex. He immediately bared his fangs and pounced ferociously at the female cub who did not know what was good for her\!

Mei Mei was not pleased with her success in her attack. She immediately turned around and pulled away to avoid being pounced on by this strong lion.

Once the other party pounced on her, the strong and heavy force would immediately suppress her until she could not retaliate.

Her speed and agility were the most lethal killer moves.

She turned around and ran, deliberately slowing down.

When this young lion caught up to her and jumped up again, preparing to pounce on her from behind, she suddenly stopped in her tracks and rolled to the side, instantly changing her direction.

When this young lion missed and landed on the ground, she had already jumped up from the ground and rushed up from the side. With a whoosh, she pierced her claws into the other party's body\!

When this young lion roared and turned its head to bite her, she had already cut a long hole in the other party's back. She jumped away again and widened the distance\!

The entire process seemed to have been rehearsed many times. It was completed in one go and there was almost no pause\!

"Roar—"

This young lion immediately roared in pain and trembled.

His back was badly mutilated and his flesh was flipped open, almost revealing his white ribs\!

Ever since he joined the Mafia Alliance and became stronger after mutation, he had never been played around and humiliated like this\!

Even those strong lions were no match for him\!

Over this period of time, at least 100 lions and female lions had died under his claws and sharp teeth\!

Now, he was actually caught in such a state by a female cub. It was a great humiliation\!

He immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation and pounced over crazily. He swore to tear this despicable lioness cub into pieces and swallow it to vent his anger\!

Mei Mei had already left his side and rushed towards another lion.

The lion was pushing her mother, Xi'er, to the ground. No matter how her mother struggled, she could not get up.

As for the lion, it could not kill her for the time being.

Because her mother was biting the lion's lips tightly and tearing them apart with all her might\!

The lion roared in pain. It could only raise its huge claws and scratch and slap his mother fiercely.

Mei Mei roared as she pounced forward and suddenly bit the lion's butt\!

"Roar—"

The lion instantly jumped up in pain and tore off a piece of its lower lip before breaking free from the crazy bite of the lioness under it.

Xi'er took this opportunity to quickly get up from the ground. Her head was covered in scratches and blood, but she roared and pounced forward again, wanting to attract the lion's hatred and attention and make her daughter attack safer.

"Bam\!"

However, this lion slapped her to the ground.

The pain in its butt made the lion furious. It immediately turned around and pounced at Mei Mei.

Behind Mei Mei, the young lion also pounced.

The two lions attacked from the front and back, roaring angrily. They were extremely furious\!

Mei Mei did not hesitate and jumped up, escaping from the side. Then, she turned around and ran towards the bushes at the back.

For lions, the grassland was the best battlefield.

However, to her and Little Curly Tail, this forest was where they could really use their strength\!

That was where their brother taught them and where they practised their skills every day.

Mei Mei successfully attracted the anger of the two lions and ran towards the bushes.

She was very fast and could still be faster. However, in order to not let the two lions feel despair, she tried to slow down and maintain a certain distance from them, making them feel that they could catch up to her easily.

Soon, they chased into the bushes one after another.

Xi'er got up from the ground, feeling dizzy. She swayed for a while and immediately ran towards her sisters.

She knew that her daughter was very fast. Once she entered the forest, she would be like a fish in water. Even if she could not defeat the two lions, she could definitely shake them off.

Out of the six lions, two were lured away.

She had to take the time to seriously injure a few more with her sisters\!

The cold father's roar was especially loud in the night.

He was no match for the strongest lion. After a few exchanges, he was slapped to the ground by the other party. If not for Aisha's desperate rescue, his spine would have long been bitten off.

He was the second son of the Mafia Alliance.

Not only was the other party strong, he was also extremely fast and had terrifying strength. If not for the fact that the cold father's physique had been modified and his bones and flesh were exceptionally tough and extraordinary, his skull would have long been broken by the other party's claw.

At this moment, Aisha and the cold father were fighting this strongest lion.

Callie and Maya dealt with another lion.

The two sisters were no match for the lion at all. If not for the help of the Nuka brothers, they would have long been bitten to death.

Xi'er looked at the situation and saw that Little Curly Tail was fighting two strong lions alone. She immediately ran over and prepared to help.

However, just as they ran close, they saw the two lions fall to the ground miserably with a thud.

Little Curly Tail's thick and long tail was like an iron whip that whistled in the air and slapped the faces, bodies, and legs of the two lions.

Every time these two lions rushed close, they would be slapped to the ground by his tail and could not get close.

At this moment, when the two lions were slapped to the ground again, Little Curly Tail's tail suddenly jumped out like a spirit snake and wrapped around the neck of a lion\!

When the lion roared and was about to bite, Little Curly Tail suddenly twisted his butt. The strong lion, which weighed more than 300 kilograms, was actually sent flying by his tail. After spinning in midair, it collided heavily with another lion with a bang.

The two lions fell to the ground again.

When Xi'er saw this scene, she was secretly shocked by this kid's strength. However, she did not dare to hesitate and immediately rushed towards the cold father and Aisha.

The second-in-command of the Mafia Alliance was extremely ferocious. The cold father and Aisha were no match for him.

Aisha was already riddled with wounds and one of the cold father's legs had been bitten off.

Xi'er roared and pounced over.

Little Curly Tail was furious when he saw his mother injured. When the two lions pounced on him again, the tail that was wagging behind him suddenly straightened like an iron rod. Then, he suddenly turned around and swept his tail out with a whoosh\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

There seemed to be the sound of bones breaking\!

The two lions that pounced over side by side were actually sent flying\!

As for the lion that had its tail slapped, half of its face collapsed\!

Half of his body had its ribs broken\!

His entire body actually sank horizontally and was almost pierced through by the tail and slapped into two\!

It spat out blood with a puff and died on the spot\!
