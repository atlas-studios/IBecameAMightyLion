Chapter 291: Mosquito Killer

"Pfft—"

After the black smoke, another huge beehive fell to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued to walk into the mountains.

Suddenly, he heard a lively buzz in front of him, as if many bees were flying.

He quickened his steps and came under a steep stone wall.

The top of the stone wall was covered in dense beehives and beehives\!

Many beeswax formed large pieces that were like the work of nature. They hung there neatly, golden and tempting. There were also many thick beeswax that flowed down the cliff and formed golden threads that flickered charmingly under the sun.

The entire top of the cliff was filled with buzzing flying wild bees.

These wild bees were a little smaller than the previous poisonous bees, but their numbers were extremely terrifying. As far as the eye could see, they were dense and came and went in a hurry. There were thousands of them and countless of them\!

Be it in his previous life or this life, Chu Xiaoye had never seen such a terrifying number of wild bees.

These wild bees had clearly mutated a long time ago. The thorns on their tails were even darker and longer. Furthermore, there were a huge number of them. If they were angered, even a super elephant herd would be stung to death\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up. His initial shock and surprise turned into frustration.

The position where these beehives hung was too high for his farts to rush up. Even if he could climb up, he did not dare to fart on the steep cliff. If he angered this group of wild bees and suffered a group beating, he would be doomed.

Furthermore, the wind was strong and there were too many wild bees. His farts might not be useful.

How could he pluck these beehives?

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail turned around and looked at Mei Mei. Mei Mei turned her head and looked at Molly.

Molly lowered her head.

No one seemed to have thought of a good solution.

They were ferocious beasts on the grassland and were really helpless against this little thing that lived on the cliff.

Furthermore, they were very afraid of being stung.

Just as everyone was helpless, the grass beside them suddenly moved and a small figure with black and white fur crawled out.

He saw that there were no lions beside it and walked straight under the cliff. He sniffed a few times and immediately climbed up the steep cliff quickly, his movements extremely agile.

This was a honey badger, commonly known as Brother Flat Top.

Like leopards, honey badgers were omnivores. Not only did they eat berries, insects, and birds, they also ate all sorts of poisonous bugs and snakes.

Of course, their favorite food was natural honey.

This honey badger had clearly just become an adult, but its claws were extremely sharp and its courage surpassed its owner's. It crawled on the steep stone wall and seemed to be able to climb towards the huge beehive in the middle effortlessly.

When the wild bees on the stone wall saw that an enemy had invaded, they immediately sent out a signal and attacked it majestically, instantly crawling all over its body.

The honey badger was fearless. It quickly crawled in front of a piece of beehive and ate with relish.

The wild bees were furious. Wave after wave of attacks were useless.

The honey badger ate its fill. When it left, it suddenly raised its head and opened its mouth. It bit dozens of wild bees and swallowed them.

The wild bees seemed to know that they had encountered their nemesis and stopped pestering them. They immediately fled.

The honey badger bulged its stomach and swaggered down the stone wall.

Just as it landed, a tail suddenly swept over and hit its limbs. With a bang, it was swept to the ground.

Brother Flat Top, who was praised by Guinness as the bravest animal in the world, was furious. He immediately got up and screamed. With a whoosh, he pounced ferociously at the tail.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and slapped it to the ground again.

Although Brother Flat Top was brave and many people exaggerated that he was fearless in Africa, not afraid of any animals, and could even defeat hyenas and lions, they actually had many nemeses in Africa.

Be it lions, hyenas, leopards, or even lower-level cheetahs, they could kill it instantly. However, most of the time, they could not be bothered with it.

In front of Little Curly Tail, this Brother Flat Top was clearly fragile.

However, no one dared to underestimate its courage and persistence.

Brother Flat Top screamed again, got up from the ground, and rushed towards Little Curly Tail.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail stood in place and did not move. He only used one tail to make it difficult for it to approach.

Other animals became weaker and more afraid as they fought, but Brother Flat Top became stronger and braver as he fought. He pounced at Little Curly Tail without stopping.

After being slapped dozens of times on the ground, it still did not escape or be afraid. Instead, it was even more ferocious and angry.

Little Curly Tail was having fun. Just as he was about to continue teasing it, Chu Xiaoye immediately growled and told him to end the battle quickly and beat the little thing up.

When Little Curly Tail heard his brother's anger, he immediately restrained his playfulness. He curled his tail and rolled the honey badger up, then quickly swung it in midair.

"Whoosh—Whoosh—"

Round after round.

After more than twenty rounds, Brother Flat Top, who was known for his courage, actually peed his pants.

Under Little Curly Tail's swing, urine splashed everywhere, as if it was raining.

Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, and the others hurriedly retreated to avoid it.

After Little Curly Tail put it down, he realized that Brother Flat Top had already rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue. His entire body was limp and trembling. He was clearly terrified.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and the others and surrounded it.

When Brother Flat Top gradually woke up, he was shocked to see so many lions surrounding him. When Little Curly Tail wrapped him with his tail again, Brother Flat Top immediately trembled in fear.

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and patted its head. Then, he pointed at the beehive at the top of the cliff and let him go up to pick it.

"Only by working can we survive\!"

Brother Flat Top immediately understood what he meant. Just as he was hesitating about whether he should die rather than submit to maintain his fearless reputation, Little Curly Tail swung his tail and sent it flying into the air.

Brother Flat Top immediately screamed in agreement.

Little Curly Tail placed it on the ground and loosened his tail.

Seeing that there was no way to escape, Brother Flat Top could only climb up the cliff in humiliation and start working as a slave.

Soon, high-quality honey fell.

The ones that flowed and froze on the cliff were also bitten off by Brother Flat Top.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others to the forest to find some bushes full of thorns. He came over and put all the beeswax on them.

Brother Flat Top continued to be busy on the cliff. His entire body was already covered in a thick layer of wild bees. All sorts of poisonous thorns attacked him, but they could not do anything to him.

Many beehives were bitten off by it.

Some wild bees fell with the beehive. Just as they were about to rush into the pride, they were knocked out by Chu Xiaoye's smelly fart.

Soon, they gathered more than a hundred pieces of pure honey of varying sizes.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and called for Brother Flat Top to come down. He did not need to continue.

Although there was a lot of honey, there was not enough manpower.

Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail bring the team back first and call for more members to help. He and Tilly stayed here to watch the rest.

Tilly was clearly unwilling to run away, and he could not order this lioness cub around.

Little Curly Tail immediately brought the team and left with the branch with honey in his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye and Tilly stayed under the cliff and guarded the remaining honey pieces to prevent some thieves from stealing them.

Brother Flat Top stood timidly at the side and did not dare to leave without permission.

However, when he saw Little Curly Tail with a long tail walk away, he immediately became restless.

"Bang\!"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked under a small tree and swung his claws, breaking the small tree\!

Then, he walked in front of a big tree and pierced his claws into the tree trunk. He suddenly dug out and the thick tree trunk seemed to be hollowed out\!

With another claw, the tree fell to the ground with a crack.

Brother Flat Top immediately froze in place. He had just quietly raised his foot and was about to escape when he immediately quietly lowered it.

"Bang\!"

Right at this moment, Tilly walked in front of a small tree and suddenly slapped it. The small tree broke and fell to the ground.

Tilly looked at Chu Xiaoye and walked in front of a big tree. She did the same thing and broke the big tree with her two claws.

Brother Flat Top started to tremble again when he saw this scene.

Tilly walked in front of Chu Xiaoye, raised her claws, and pointed at the steep stone wall, her eyes filled with provocation.

"Smelly fart king, do you dare to try? Let's see who can climb higher and who dares to pick the honey?"

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with her and took a few steps away from her.

Tilly immediately stuck out her chest and looked up with disdain.

"Don't dare? As long as you defeat me, I'll join your pride in the future and be your subordinate, heeding your every command. However, if I defeat you, you'll return to the snow mountain with me and be my subordinate in the future. How about that? Do you dare to bet?"

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and rolled his eyes, indicating that he was not interested.

However, he looked at Brother Flat Top with encouragement.

Brother Flat Top was stunned for a moment before he immediately became excited. He stared at Tilly with high fighting spirit.

"I'll compete with you\!"

"Bang\!"

Tilly slapped him away and glared at Chu Xiaoye.

"Coward\! You're a majestic lion king, can't you even compare to a female cub?"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked in front of a piece of honey. He stuck out his tongue and licked it. A fragrant sweetness slid into his mouth.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a roar suddenly came from the forest beside him.

Then, two huge black bears sniffed and walked out of the forest drooling. They looked straight at the honey pieces that emitted a tempting fragrance all over the ground.

With their roars, three more black bears walked out of the forest.

These five black bears were all strong and huge. After mutating, they were now standing upright and were even taller than a water buffalo.

These five black bears were all strong and huge. After mutating, they were now standing upright and were even taller than a water buffalo.

The black bear was extremely strong. Its claws and teeth were also very sharp and its skin was thick and rough. It was difficult to kill it in one move. When they bit or slapped some small animals, they would fall to the ground.

However, like tigers, they had always been alone.

As for the five strong black bears in front of him, they were gathered.

Clearly, after mutation, they had become more intelligent and realized that they had plenty of food and that their enemies were stronger. It was easier to survive alone than to survive together.

Honey was full of temptation for them, like how children liked to eat those sweet sweets.

At this moment, the gazes of the five black bears were almost attracted by the pile of transparent and golden honey on the ground. They completely treated Chu Xiaoye and Tilly as air.

They drooled and walked over quickly.

When Brother Flat Top saw this scene, he was secretly happy. He finally found a chance to escape.

When lions and bears fought, it was beneficial\!

It retreated to the side of a rock, preparing to sneak away while they were fighting and take away a few pieces of honey.

"Roar—"

The five black bears came close and saw Chu Xiaoye and Tilly blocking the front of the honey pieces. They immediately roared angrily, bared their fangs, and glared fiercely at the two little fellows.

Even an adult lion would pee its pants and run away with its tail between its legs when it encountered the five of them\!

Furthermore, it was these two little things\!

Chu Xiaoye and Tilly looked at each other and saw the fighting spirit in their eyes. Clearly, they were preparing the five brothers to test their golden claws and compete in their true strength.

"Buzz —"

Just as the two sides were ready to fight, a clear buzzing sound suddenly came from the cliff above.

The wild bees circling the cliff seemed to have encountered something and suddenly started to scatter in panic, escaping in different directions, ignoring the remaining nests.

The wild bees in the nest also crawled out and fled in all directions.

Even when Brother Flat Top went up to pick their nests just now, he had never seen them so terrified.

Suddenly, many wild bees fell from the sky like petals and fluttered.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at the wild bees on the ground and was shocked. These wild bees that were flying on it just now had turned into withered corpses in the blink of an eye. They were blown by the wind and turned to dust\!

He immediately looked up and saw a black mass on it. There were wild bees fleeing in panic everywhere, but he could not see what had made them like this.

"Buzz —"

A buzz came from above.

A group of wild bees flew down in panic.

Right at this moment, a black mass of things quickly fell from above and immediately lay on their bodies.

Almost instantly, the group of wild bees turned into withered empty shells and drifted down\!

This time, Chu Xiaoye finally saw those ambushers clearly.

They were a group of mosquitoes with sharp mouths\!

At this moment, the mosquitoes seemed to have discovered them and immediately landed. They flew towards them with a buzz and looked aggressive and murderous\!
