Chapter 567: Escaping the Sea

The riot at the harbor was too sudden and no one could react in time.

There were only more than 100 patrolling soldiers sent here from Suhang City. After hearing the news, they ran over, but it was a drop in the bucket. Before they could rush up, they were messed up by the panicked crowd.

The guards in the city and the army stationed outside the city had yet to hear the news.

The few young men who had followed Yang Shaoqing over thought that they could escape faster on horses, but they did not know that their targets were even more obvious. They were all killed by Denise and Fei'er's arrows\!

After Chu Xiaoye went forward to save the Qin family's Madam and Little Guai, he called for Qin Zhitan to board the ship immediately.

Now, in this Suhang City and the entire Southern Tang Empire, the Qin family had no place to stand. If they stayed, their entire family would be slaughtered.

No one had expected it to happen to this extent.

Even if he did not let Denise shoot Yang Shaoqing, from the previous situation, the destruction of the Qin family was inevitable.

This city that looked rich and stable hid too much darkness. Once they touched it, they would be doomed.

Qin Zhitan carried Qin Yu, whose legs had been broken, out of the carriage and shouted, "Sons of the Qin family, quickly get on the ship\!"

If he did not leave now, he would never be able to leave when the soldiers and army of Suhang City arrived.

Although many members of the Qin family were still in Suhang City, they could not care less about their families at this moment.

If they did not complete it in time, their entire tribe would be wiped out.

Under the shout of Qin Zhitan, most of the Qin family retreated and ran towards the big ship.

There were also people who could not abandon their family members and ran home with their weapons in hand. However, this was clearly an act of courting death.

Many people shouted and persuaded, but it was useless.

Some people would rather die with their families.

Chu Xiaoye hugged Qin Xiaoye and jumped onto the ship with the elven girls.

Qin Mo supported her mother and followed her.

The owner of the ship, the white-haired old man, was jumping on the deck and saying with a desperate expression, "It's over\! It's over\! It's completely over\! Qin Zhitan, you killed me\!"

Indeed, he was already on the same boat as the Qin family.

Even if he quit now, the soldiers would never let him go.

Furthermore, more than 100 members of the Qin family were holding weapons and charging onto the ship with a murderous aura. Even if he wanted to get off the ship, he did not dare to.

Qin Zhitan was the last to get on the boat. He wiped the blood on his face and panted. "Uncle Wu\! Start the boat\!"

The soldiers in Suhang should have already received the news and were rushing over. It was not so simple for the big ship to leave the harbor. Fortunately, they had already been prepared.

"Uncle, wait a while more\! My brother went to fetch my mother\!"

"Uncle, my father went back to fetch Wei'er too. Let's wait a while?"

At this moment, many members of the Qin family came and begged him to wait.

A hint of pain appeared on Qin Zhitan's face and he made a prompt decision. "Everyone, we can't wait anymore. If we wait any longer, all of us will die here. The hope of my Qin family is entrusted to you. We can't destroy our entire family here\!"

With that said, he immediately roared at the dark-skinned old man, "Uncle Wu\! Start the boat\! Start the boat\!"

As he spoke, he held the dagger in his hand and walked towards the old man he had previously respected very much.

Old Wu's heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly shouted inside, "Start the boat\! Start the boat\!"

The ship swayed and started to retreat from the harbor.

Right at this moment, a few figures with burdens on their backs suddenly ran over from the distant street. As they ran towards the pier, they shouted, "Wait\! Wait\! Wait for us\!"

"Uncle\! It's my father and the others\!"

The young man hurriedly said to Qin Zhitan.

Qin Zhitan stood on the deck and was about to let Old Wu order the ship to stop when a large group of soldiers suddenly rode their warhorses out of the street and shouted angrily, "Stop the ship\! Stop the ship\!"

Old Wu's face was pale and his legs were trembling.

Qin Zhitan stood beside him with a dagger in his hand and stopped talking.

The soldiers riding horses knocked the running Qin family members to the ground and were tied up by the soldiers behind who could not.

One of the little boys screamed and struggled. He was pulled out by an officer and cut on the neck.

The members of the Qin family, who were standing on the deck, watched until their eyes almost popped out and their bodies trembled.

"Stop the ship\! Boss Wu, I order you to stop the ship\!"

The soldiers riding warhorses shouted angrily as they rushed over.

Although Old Man Wu was terrified, he knew that if the ship was stopped, he and the crew would definitely die. Even if the Qin family did not kill them, the Suhang authorities would never let them go.

Therefore, he immediately shouted at his crew, "Set off\! Set off\!"

At this moment, the big ship had already retreated more than ten meters from the shore and started to change directions to walk towards the sea.

The soldiers chased to the harbor and were flustered and exasperated. They cursed and threatened, but it was useless.

Some soldiers boarded the small boats at the side, but they realized that they did not know how to row boats at all.

As for the other big boats docked at the harbor, there was no one on them.

The riot just now scared everyone away.

Even if they had a boat now, they could not start it.

"Inform the navy\! Go and inform the navy\!"

The officer stood at the harbor and roared angrily.

A riot had happened at the harbor. So many soldiers had died and a few young masters with rather strong backgrounds had died as well. This matter would definitely spread out to Suhang and the capital. They could not escape the blame and had to catch the culprit\!

The big ship left the harbor and pushed the waves forward quickly.

Some of the Qin family on the deck stood in a daze, some sat on the ground and cried while hugging their heads, and some looked at the gradually disappearing pier and cried. They never would have thought that such a thing would happen today.

They had done business their entire lives and been obedient in front of the Suhang soldiers for their entire lives. However, they never would have thought that they would suddenly pick up their weapons today and kill those soldiers, becoming thieves.

Until now, many people still did not know what happened or why.

Why was Qin Zhitan's family caught by that young master and threatened at the harbor?

"Uncle, were those elves just now your guests?"

The young man whose father and family did not have the time to board the ship came in front of Qin Zhitan and said with red eyes.

He had heard Yang Shaoqing's words previously. That young master seemed to be looking for a guest of the Qin family. All of this should have been caused by those elves.

Qin Zhitan said with a dark face, "Ci'er, this has nothing to do with them. With fate like this, my Qin family should have this trouble."

Qin Ci wiped the tears in his eyes and turned to leave.

He wanted to personally ask those elves how they had provoked such a disaster\!

No matter what, those elves had to explain to them\!
