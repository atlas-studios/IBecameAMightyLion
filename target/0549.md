Chapter 549: The Fallen Elf

The three rhinoceroses died from exhaustion.

When Lanisi and the other two jumped down from the rhinoceros, Denise also jumped down from Chu Xiaoye's back.

At this moment, they had already run dozens of kilometers away. The ferocious beast cavalry would definitely not be able to chase after them, but the other orc armies might rush over from other directions.

Therefore, they did not dare to stay any longer and continued forward.

Until the sky turned dark, they found a patch of bushes and hid in it, preparing to rest for the night.

According to Doya's estimation, if she wanted to leave this grassland and lean on her legs, she would need at least three days.

No one knew what would happen in these three days.

Athies' death was undoubtedly a heavy blow to their operation.

Not to mention that his speed had slowed, the danger factor had also increased.

"Perhaps, we can find a few mounts."

In the bushes, Chu Xiaoye weakly transformed back to an elf. His previous transformation and the lion king's roar had exhausted too much of his energy. He could no longer maintain the lion body.

He always felt that ever since he could transform, he seemed to have changed his identity.

He was clearly a lion, but his original form had become an elf and the lion had actually become his transformation identity.

Perhaps if he left this world and returned to that world, everything would be normal again.

"Night, mounts are nurtured from young. They have to be nurtured for at least a few years. We don't have that much time now."

Lanisi also looked exhausted.

Although she had been riding on the rhinoceros’ back previously, she had also exhausted a lot of energy while the rhinoceros was running crazily.

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "The mount I'm talking about is not what you think. As long as you can bring us along, the wild beasts on the grassland should be able to."

Lanisi asked in confusion, "Most wild beasts are unruly. Will they be obedient?"

Chu Xiaoye smiled and said, "You've underestimated the intelligence of wild beasts now. Under fear, their arrogance and pride are not worth mentioning."

Fei'er, who was at the side, said excitedly, "Lord Night, have you thought of a solution? Then what kind of mount do we need? Fei'er wants a beautiful zebra to ride."

Vilis sneered from the side. "Your Lord Night actually wants you to ride him."

When Fei'er heard this, she was not shy at all. Her eyes were bright and she said excitedly, "Alright, alright. Lord Night's entire body is shining with golden light. He's much more impressive riding than a zebra."

Chu Xiaoye got up and walked to Vilis' side.

Vilis immediately clenched her fists and looked up at him. She said provocatively, "Why, do you want to fight?"

Chu Xiaoye said, "Get up\!"

Vilis stood up and sneered. "This time, I won't show mercy\!"

Unexpectedly, Chu Xiaoye only extended his hand and gestured at her head, then placed it on his chest and teased, "Shorty, you won't call me shorty again, right?"

Vilis was furious. She widened her eyes and said, "Shorty, shorty, shorty, shorty\! I shouted, what are you going to do?"

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and smiled at everyone. "Look, the true Shortie is angry from embarrassment."

"Go to hell\!"

Vilis suddenly punched his stomach.

Chu Xiaoye was already prepared. He turned around and dodged, then punched her chest.

Vilis immediately retreated and grabbed the sword hilt, preparing to pull it out.

Lanisi hurriedly said, "Vilis\! No\!"

The spinning storm of this huge sword loli did not have eyes. Once it was used, it would definitely kill.

"Do you dare to fight me bare-handed?"

Chu Xiaoye threw away the sword at his waist and said while grinding his fists.

He really wanted to see if his body was still as agile as before after growing taller.

"Why not\!"

The huge sword loli threw away the sword in her hand without hesitation and clenched her fists. "This time, I won't give in to you\! Just wait and cry\!"

With that said, she rushed up.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light as he watched her every move clearly and stood in place without moving.

When she rushed in front of him and threw a punch, Chu Xiaoye did not dodge or retreat and also punched.

He had never been afraid of anyone when fighting head-on\!

"Bang\!"

The two fists collided heavily.

Chu Xiaoye's wrist trembled and he took a few steps back. He immediately felt a pain on the back of his hand.

Vilis rushed up and swung her other fist.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and still stuck out his fist.

"Bang\!"

The two fists collided heavily again.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place without moving, and Vilis also stood in place without moving, but her two small hands were trembling.

"Continue\!"

Chu Xiaoye smiled. Although the back of his hand hurt, the pain soon started to dissipate.

Vilis suddenly raised her foot and kicked him in the stomach\!

Chu Xiaoye extended his fist to welcome it\!

"Bang\!"

Fist and foot collided heavily\!

This time, the huge sword loli staggered and tiptoed. She took a few steps back and almost fell.

She stood steadily, but she was still standing on her tiptoes slightly. Her feet were trembling slightly, and a painful expression appeared on her face, but it disappeared in a flash.

"Continue\!"

Chu Xiaoye continued to provoke him.

He could tell that other than her superb sword skills, her other attacks did not hurt him at all. Even her natural divine strength, which she was pleased with, was completely crushed by him.

"Why, are you going to cry from the pain?"

Chu Xiaoye laughed mockingly and did not have any protective feelings for the fairer sex.

He should suppress this arrogant and rude personality so that he would not argue with him on the way.

"Vilis, forget it. Night is no match for you. Spare him."

Lanisi could also tell that she could not defeat this youth without her sword. In order to save her face, she could only say this.

However, her words made the huge sword loli even more embarrassed.

She felt insulted\!

"I want to kill him\!"

The little loli's eyes were red and she cried. She limped in front of Chu Xiaoye and punched him in the stomach.

Seeing that the situation seemed to be impossible to resolve, Chu Xiaoye could only spin around and dodge her fist. The moment he passed by her, he wrapped his arm around her slender waist and picked her up. He spun her around a few times before placing her on the ground. He smiled and said, "Don't cry. We're family. We're just playing. Winning and losing isn't that important."

It would have been better if he did not say anything. Now that he did, Vilis started crying. She punched his chest with her fists and cried, "Who's on your side\! I didn't lose\! I didn't lose\! Wuwu…"

Chu Xiaoye did not expect this girl to be so fragile. Didn't just she suddenly realize that the fellow he had crushed into dregs suddenly crushed him?

Could he not take this blow?

"Shortie, you have to be strong."

Chu Xiaoye wrapped one arm around her waist and touched her head with the other. He did not move no matter how she punched him.

"Lord Night is so powerful."

Fei'er went to the queen's side and praised her with admiration.

Lanisi sighed and muttered, "Yes, none of us can escape his grasp."

Fei'er was stunned for a moment. She turned around and looked at her, not understanding.

Lanisi smiled and stroked her pink hair. "You're the first to fall for him. Look at your infatuated little face. You'll probably go limp with him curling his finger."

Fei'er blinked her big clear eyes, still not fully understanding.
