Chapter 78: The Poison of the Giant Lizard

The cold father was afraid.

When the female lions were filled with righteous indignation and were about to fight a common enemy, the Seno brothers' pride, he retreated.

He put away his fangs and looked coldly and angrily at the Seno brothers. He did not do anything else.

The female lions turned their heads and looked at him. Their auras had just been aroused and they instantly melted.

Their roars stopped abruptly.

They were unwilling and furious.

However, the cold father remained silent and did not express anything.

The Seno brothers' pride was immediately pleased.

Be it the Seno brothers or the five female lions, their eyes were filled with ridicule and disdain.

They ignored the pride and started to pounce on the Komodo Dragon.

They wanted to snatch their prey and eat it in front of this pride\!

This was the beginning\!

This territory would ultimately belong to their Seno brothers' pride\!

The Komodo Dragon started to flee in panic.

However, the five female lions of the Seno brothers' pride had already pounced on it.

They had never seen such an animal.

However, from the way the pride of the cold father chased it away, it should not be a big threat.

It looked far inferior to a crocodile.

"Whoosh\!"

The lion, Seno Jr, seized the opportunity and jumped onto the back of the Giant Komodo Dragon. Just like Aisha previously, he bit the Komodo Dragon's neck\!

"Crack\!"

With a crisp sound, the spine of the Komodo Dragon seemed to have been broken.

It fell to the ground.

The female lions of the Seno brothers' pride immediately rushed forward\!

They bit the legs, tail, and back excitedly and fiercely\!

A pregnant lioness bit the abdomen of the Komodo Dragon and started to eat.

She was hungry.

Seno Sr stood in place and looked coldly at the pride of the cold father.

He did not eat it immediately. Instead, he was guarding against the sudden attack of the pride of the cold father.

The Komodo Dragon was still struggling, shaking its head vigorously to bite Seno Jr.

Seno Jr bit its neck fiercely and did not let go.

The female lions of the cold father's pride were silent, angry, humiliated, and unwilling. However, they could only watch helplessly as they snatched their prey and ate it in front of them.

Their stomachs were already rumbling with hunger.

The cold father glanced at the Seno brothers' pride and turned his head, preparing to leave with the pride.

However, the female lions stood in place in a daze, letting out hoarse roars of anger and unwillingness.

The Komodo Dragon finally stopped moving.

Seno Jr let go of its neck and raised its head. Its mouth was full of blood as it bared its fangs at the female lions of the cold father's pride. It was pleased and arrogant, and it even wagged its tail.

It seemed to be saying: Your king is a coward and a good-for-nothing\! If you follow him, you will never be full\!

The blood on his teeth had already turned black.

Suddenly\!

His body trembled and he could not help but shiver. He swayed and walked down from the back of the Komodo Dragon.

He swayed his head, seemingly feeling that his vision was a little blurry and his neck was a little numb.

He swayed as if he was drunk. After taking a few steps on the grass, his limbs suddenly turned limp and he fell to the ground. His entire body started to twitch and black blood flowed from his mouth.

His brother, Seno Sr, was shocked. He hurriedly ran over to check on him.

The female lions that were biting the corpse of the Komodo Dragon also stood up in fear and surrounded him.

They did not know what was wrong with him.

Seno Jr stared with his eyes wide open. After his muscles twitched violently a few times, his limbs suddenly stiffened and he let out his last roar\!

He never moved again.

Seno Sr and the five female lions stood in front of him, stunned.

The cold father, who was about to leave, twisted his neck and looked at this strange scene in bewilderment.

Aisha's body trembled.

She turned around and looked at her son, her eyes filled with lingering fear.

Little Curly Tail also turned to look at his brother. His amber eyes were bright.

Brother is brother. So smart\!

No wonder he had rudely pushed his mother away previously\!

It turned out that this monster was poisonous\!

Little Curly Tail's admiration and respect for his brother was like a torrential river that flowed endlessly. It was like the overflowing of the Yellow River that could not be stopped.

Then, he could not help but lean behind his brother's butt and prepared to lick it while his brother was not paying attention.

His admiration for his brother was uncontrollable\!

In the end, just as his tongue reached out, before he could lick it, his brother, who was looking at the giant lizard in a daze, suddenly raised his hind leg and kicked his mouth\!

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail jumped up in fright and hurriedly ran away.

Mei Mei, who was at the side, looked at his sorry and embarrassed appearance and immediately wagged her tail in schadenfreude.

Seno Jr was lying on the ground, having already stopped breathing.

The Komodo Dragon was also lying on the ground, having lost its life. Its open eyes seemed to be mocking him and wanting to bring him down with himself.

Seno Sr stood in front of his brother, sad and terrified.

As for the five female lions that had just bitten the Komodo Dragon and had bloody mouths, they were inexplicably terrified.

Although they were very hungry, they did not dare to touch the monster's corpse again.

This monster was definitely poisonous\!

Seno Jr's death caught the Seno brothers' pride off guard, making them shocked and afraid.

Their previously arrogant and contemptuous expressions turned into nothingness at this moment.

The female lions were restless, flustered, and did not know what to do.

They looked at the pride of the cold father.

This time, the strength of the two prides was finally equal.

Furthermore, if they added in the four young cubs of the cold father's pride, the pride would probably be stronger than them.

At this moment, the cold father finally turned around and took a few steps forward, looking at them coldly.

Xi'er and the others immediately restored their fighting spirit and stood beside the cold father.

They had invaded their territory and snatched their prey repeatedly\!

The anger and hatred in the hearts of the cold father's pride turned into surging fighting spirit and killing intent at this moment\!

Seno Jr's death was his own fault\!

Now, the pride of the cold father lion must recover their lost dignity, banish the invading enemies, and restore the pride of the pride\!

Seno Sr raised his head and looked coldly at the cold father.

The cold father also looked at him coldly, not afraid.

He was not afraid of fighting alone\!

Chu Xiaoye stood behind his mother and looked at the dead Komodo Dragon, then at the five female lions opposite him. He understood.

This corpse should still be edible.

Seno Jr's death must have been because he had bitten the poisonous gland of the Komodo Dragon and it entered from his mouth. Otherwise, he would not have died from the venom so quickly.

As for the other parts of the corpse, there should be no venom.

The fact that those five female lions were alive was the best proof.

Then, this feast still belonged to the cold father's pride.

Of course, the prerequisite was that they had to defeat the other party\!

"Roarâ€”"

The cold father suddenly roared and took the lead to charge forward.

Aisha and Xi'er followed closely\!
