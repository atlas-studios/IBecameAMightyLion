Chapter 253: The Killer God of the Mafia

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Big Nuka, who was attacking a member of the Mafia alliance with the female lions, was sent flying by a silent black lion\!

Big Nuka fell to the ground in a sorry state and could not get up for a long time.

After the black lion sent him flying, it suddenly jumped up and pushed Maya to the ground, biting her head\!

If she was bitten by his sharp fangs, Maya's skull would be instantly crushed.

Her two children would also lose their mothers.

Right at this critical moment, Little Curly Tail's tail flew over from behind with a whoosh. It wrapped around the black lion's hind leg and suddenly pulled\!

The black lion was caught off guard and its four hundred kilogram body was pulled to the ground and retreated.

"Roar—"

He immediately roared angrily and stood up. He suddenly pulled his hind legs forward and a huge force suddenly flipped Little Curly Tail to the ground.

The black lion immediately turned its head and opened its bloody mouth, preparing to bite\!

Little Curly Tail hurriedly let go of his tail, rolled out, and jumped up.

At this moment, Mei Mei had already pounced from the side. Her sharp claws pierced into the back of the black lion with a whoosh.

However, before she could use her strength to tear it, the black lion's huge claws had already flown over and slapped her head ruthlessly with a bang\!

Mei Mei's delicate body immediately flew out like a kite with a broken string and fell heavily to the ground.

Xi'er, who was biting the member of the Mafia's alliance, immediately roared angrily. She rushed over with her face covered in blood and pounced at the black lion\!

At the same time, Little Curly Tail rushed up again.

The black lion fought one against two and did not dodge. It suddenly raised its upper body and swung its two huge claws ferociously. With two bangs, it actually sent Xi'er and Little Curly Tail flying.

Xi'er fell to the ground and struggled for a few times. She was dizzy and blood flowed from her mouth and nose. Her vision turned black and she could not stand up for a moment.

As for Little Curly Tail, after rolling a few times on the ground, he immediately jumped up and pounced ferociously at the black lion again\!

The black lion looked at him in surprise. It immediately roared angrily and took the initiative to charge up. With a whoosh, its two huge feet revealed a pair of black claws\!

Those black claws were suffused with a cold and demonic luster under the moonlight.

"Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail was sent flying again\!

At the same time, the black lion's sharp claws left a deep wound on his head\!

Just as Little Curly Tail fell to the ground, before he could get up, the black lion had already rushed over again. Its sharp claws were raised high and it grabbed ruthlessly at his abdomen\!

"Whoosh\!"

A light blue light suddenly lit up behind him\!

At some point in time, Mei Mei had already rushed over. Her raised right claw suddenly grabbed his butt and pierced into his muscles with a whoosh\!

The sharp light blue claws grabbed his muscles and suddenly swung hard. The black lion's huge body was actually sent flying backward\!

After flying for six to seven meters, he fell heavily to the ground with a bang\!

Little Curly Tail jumped up from the ground and looked at Mei Mei's claws in shock.

Mei Mei's claws flickered with a light blue light and she was even holding a bloody piece of flesh\!

"Roar—"

The black lion roared miserably and jumped up from the ground. Like a cannonball, it rushed towards Mei Mei with a bang\!

Its speed was indescribable\!

Like a gust of wind, it arrived almost in the blink of an eye\!

"Bang\!"

Before Mei Mei could react, she was sent flying by a slap\!

Before she could land on the ground, the black lion chased after her again and slapped her into the air with a bang\!

When the black lion chased after him again and was about to slap him, Little Curly Tail immediately roared angrily and pounced forward. He used his body to hit his side and fell to the ground with the black lion.

"Whoosh\!"

The tail behind him quickly wrapped around the root of the black lion's tail. He immediately jumped up and ran into the distance\!

The black lion was just about to jump up when it was pulled back quickly\!

Grass flew and rustled on the ground.

Little Curly Tail roared angrily and straightened his tail, running quickly\!

Mei Mei fell to the ground, blood flowing from her mouth, her ribs broken, and her entire body in pain. After struggling for a long time, she stood up shakily and walked towards her mother with difficulty.

Xi'er crawled on the ground, her face covered in blood. Her remaining eye looked at her vaguely. She wanted to get up, but she could not.

Finally, Mei Mei came in front of her and fell into her arms.

The mother-daughter pair leaned against each other and pressed their heads tightly against each other.

Not far away, Callie and Maya were still biting the lion.

Both sides were already riddled with wounds, but their anger and bloodthirst were aroused. No one dared to retreat.

On the other side.

The cold father and Little Nuka were still roaring and biting the second son of the Mafia alliance.

Aisha lay at the side covered in blood and could not stand up.

The cold father limped with one leg and opened his bloody mouth to attack crazily, as if he had already risked his life.

Little Nuka bit from the back and side.

The lion was also riddled with wounds and covered in blood, but its combat strength was still strong. It fought two enemies alone and was not at a disadvantage.

When Little Curly Tail dragged the black lion and ran dozens of meters away, the black lion's claws suddenly grabbed the ground and grabbed tightly into the soil. It finally stabilized its body\!

Just as he was about to accumulate strength to counterattack, Little Curly Tail suddenly roared angrily. Almost all his strength was gathered on his tail. With a bang, blood splashed everywhere and he actually broke the black lion's tail from the root\!

"Roar—"

In the night, the miserable scream of the black lion suddenly sounded, and it almost spread throughout the entire grassland\!

More than ten kilometers away, in the territory of the Nuka lions, when this roar sounded, a team of six huge super lions was running over quickly under the lead of a young lion king.

"Bam\!"

Just as the black lion broke its tail and let out a miserable scream, Little Curly Tail's tail suddenly flew over like an iron whip and hit the wound on his broken tail heavily\!

"Roar—"

The black lion let out a miserable scream again and suddenly jumped up. It actually jumped four to five meters high and landed on the ground. Blood sprayed from its butt and it cried out endlessly\!

However, this aroused his ferocity\!

He suddenly roared angrily, as if he had stimulated all his potential. He instantly rushed in front of Little Curly Tail and hit him with his head with a bang\!

Little Curly Tail did not have the time to dodge and was sent flying\!

When Little Curly Tail landed heavily on the ground, his entire body was in pain and his vision turned black. Before he could get up, the black lion's smelly mouth had already pounced over and bit his neck\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly came from the side\!

The seriously injured Aisha somehow gained the strength to stand up again. At the same time, she rushed over crazily and mimicked the black lion's actions just now. She used her head as a weapon and hit the strong body of the black lion with a bang\!

The black lion was caught off guard. Its body suddenly trembled and it fell to the side.

Aisha also fell on Little Curly Tail. Her vision turned black and she fainted. Scarlet blood flowed from her mouth and nose.

Little Curly Tail got up and looked at his mother's miserable and terrifying appearance. His tail, which was curled behind him, trembled slightly. The fur on it stood up like sharp thorns\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly came from the darkness not far away.

Then, another black lion that was even larger ran over with a group of strong lions.

This was another lion alliance subdued by the Mafia\!

The larger black lion was the true ruler of the Mafia alliance\!

He was the only king of these two lion alliances\!

His name was Sed and he was nicknamed the Killing God\!
