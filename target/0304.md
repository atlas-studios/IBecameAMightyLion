Chapter 304: The Lion King's Challenge

He would pay him back in his own coin.

The surroundings were deathly silent.

No one had thought that this young lion king, who seemed to be preparing to retreat, would suddenly attack and cut off the lion's head.

Furthermore, he was so tough and arrogant\!

The opposite pride froze in place, dumbfounded. For a moment, they could not react.

The pride on this side did not expect their king to be so domineering and fierce, not giving the other party any face.

On the grass.

The headless corpse was still bleeding.

The huge lion head that rolled to the side widened its terrified eyes and died with a grievance.

He probably never would have thought that this young lion king, who was clearly about to let him go, would suddenly kill him regardless of the consequences.

His widened eyes happened to look at the female cub lying opposite him.

He planned to bite through the female cub's neck and bite her head off. He would bring her back to pee and humiliate this team.

However, now, he was the one suffering this tragedy and humiliation.

Molly lay on the ground and also looked at him. Her wide eyes were filled with shock and confusion.

She did not seem to understand why this young king would spare no effort to cut off the head of this lion in front of the other party's king and pride.

This lion was one of the four guards of the golden-haired lion king.

And she was nothing.

She was just a wandering lion that had no home and was taken in by the pride of the cold father.

Was it worth it?

The burning pain in her neck had disappeared and a cool stream flowed through the wound to her entire body.

She looked at the young king in front of her again.

"Roar—"

The opposite pride finally woke up and roared angrily. They bared their fangs and surged forward with fierce expressions. They stood at the border, angry and hateful.

He was only a step away from crossing the line\!

As for the young golden-haired lion king, it also bared its sharp fangs and stared fixedly at the king beside the decapitated corpse.

Little Curly Tail brought the pride forward and stood at the border. His head almost collided with the heads of the opposite pride. They bared their teeth and roared angrily, glaring at the other party and not showing any weakness\!

Chu Xiaoye put away his claws and walked forward. He stood at the border and looked at the lion king opposite him.

Haas also walked over and looked at him closely.

This young golden-haired lion king's expression was dark and its eyes were filled with uncontrollable anger and ferocity. It no longer had its previous refined and cultured appearance.

The two young lion kings looked at each other without moving.

The prides of both sides bared their teeth and roared angrily. They were almost unable to hold back and were about to pounce on him and bite him at any time.

"Roar—"

Haas suddenly growled and ordered the team beside him to retreat. At the same time, he looked provocatively at Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. The pride behind him did not have as many lions as before. There were at most fifty lions. Obviously, the other prides had already gone to further places to divide new territory or to the frontline to guard the black prides. They would not be able to return in a while.

Furthermore, they had rushed over from afar and had yet to rest.

Therefore, if the two teams fought, they would definitely be the ones to suffer.

This young golden-haired lion king saw this very clearly. Therefore, he decided to use the rules that had been passed down since ancient times to determine the victor.

Lion King against Lion King\!

Under his orders, the pride around him could only retreat four to five meters.

This mighty and majestic golden-haired lion king stood majestically at the border and looked at the younger opponent in front of him. Its gaze was provocative and it let out a roar of challenge.

"Then, let's put an end to tonight's matter with our blood\! A king is responsible for his life and death. Do you dare?"

His guard was killed, and it was in front of him. His head was cruelly cut off in front of so many of his subordinates. If he did not take revenge and make this lion king pay the price with his blood, how could he, the king, have the face and qualifications to continue on as king?

Haas raised his head and appeared even stronger and provocative.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not order the pride around him to retreat like him. Instead, he suddenly growled and raised his head, looking at him arrogantly and shamelessly with a mocking expression.

"You want to fight one-on-one? Do you think I'm an idiot? I haven't even grown fur yet. You're a dignified adult lion and you're even covered in golden armor. You actually want to bully a minor? Where's your face? I want to gang up on you. What can you do to me?"

Only a fool would force himself to fight alone.

If he could win, he would naturally be willing to follow the rules of the pride and fight alone.

Most importantly, he clearly could not win now.

He could have clearly used numbers and a relaxed state to fight the other party in groups. Why did he have to give the other party a chance to fight alone and put himself in danger?

He was not a fool\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail immediately roared angrily, swung his tail, and stood beside him, eager to attack.

Mei Mei, Tilly, and Catherine all made a pounce posture.

The tall and strong Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and Jerry brothers all had cold gazes, like a few ancient ferocious beasts with fierce auras, preparing to pounce on them at any time.

Opposite him, only the young lion king stood there in a daze.

His subordinates had just listened to his orders and retreated four to five meters away.

The corner of his mouth twitched as he looked at the young lion king in front of him in disbelief. He could not believe that this fellow would actually say such shameless words.

He turned around and looked at his subordinates behind him. He opened his mouth, as if he wanted to call them over, but he felt embarrassed.

He stood at the border alone and faced this group of fellows who were murderous and did not care about the rules of the lion tribe. He was shocked and furious. He looked at Chu Xiaoye disdainfully and let out a mocking growl.

"You're so timid and weak that you don't even have the courage to fight me. Are you worthy of being a king? If you're a man, let's fight fair and square in front of our respective prides\! Do you dare?"

"No."

Chu Xiaoye's answer was crisp and did not feel like he was embarrassing himself at all.

Then, with a whoosh, he raised his hind legs and peed in front of him, looking at him teasingly.

"Unless you kneel down and lick this King's pee. If you lick it well, this King might consider fighting you alone."

Since the enmity had already been formed, he did not mind humiliating this golden-haired lion king again and making it eager to take revenge.

Because he suddenly remembered that during this period of time, many wandering lions had come to rely on him.

If this pride of the golden-haired lion king was already in the grassland in front of them, there would be no way so many wandering lions would come and join them.

Obviously, some spies had already sneaked into their team.

These spies did not belong to those black lions, but to this golden-haired lion king.

The longer they delayed, the more dangerous it would be.

As the other party became stronger and stronger, their team would become weaker and weaker.

Therefore, he had to take this opportunity to eliminate them.

After a lion king who always pretended to be gentle and elegant was angered, he would naturally lose his mind and do some rash and crazy things in advance.

"Roar—"

Indeed, this young lion king finally roared again and gritted its teeth.

In the team not far behind the pride of the cold father, some figures were restless. They stared intently at the golden-haired lion king, as if they were waiting for his gaze.
