Chapter 483: Beast Empire\!

Half a month later.

The snow was still snow. The bushes were covered in silver and snow.

On the grassland, there was a thick layer of snow. Walking on it, half of his legs would sink in.

This extraordinary weather made many animals unable to sleep at night.

However, the grass was still lush and there was still plenty of food.

Herbivores would not starve, and carnivores would not.

The pride lived here peacefully and freely.

The threat above him had already been resolved.

The strange vine never appeared again, and the winged dragons living on it never came down. They seemed to disdain the animals on the grassland and under the tree.

The pride was safe here.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye should leave.

Before leaving, he solemnly handed the entire pride to Little Curly Tail, who was becoming more and more like a king.

There was no reluctance.

On a certain night, he took the opportunity to pee and left quietly.

The little girl rode on the big black bear and had long crossed the river. She waited on the other side of the river.

A snow-white bird landed on her shoulder obediently like her little pet.

Chu Xiaoye came to the river and was about to jump over when Alisa's scent suddenly came from behind.

He would probably never forget the scent of this female cub.

Of course, he would not be narcissistic and think that the other party was here to bid farewell to him or even follow him away.

This was not her personality.

Alisa walked to the river and looked at the little girl on the other side of the river. She turned around and looked at him with her amber eyes. Her mouth curled up and she revealed a very happy expression.

"Smelly fart lion, are you finally leaving?"

This was like a frog at the bottom of a well mocking its other companion who had jumped out of the well. "Good, leave\! The territory at the bottom of the well is mine\! Caw, caw, caw\!"

Chu Xiaoye also opened his mouth and said, "Are you happy?"

Alisa swayed her tail and narrowed her eyes with a smile. "Of course I'm happy\! I'm extremely happy\!"

"Then, I hope you'll be happy forever\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped over the river and landed on the other side. He looked back at her and suddenly remembered that he had given her his first time. He could not help but feel a little sad.

However, let the past be.

Tomorrow would be even better\!

Just as he was about to walk away, Alisa suddenly growled and raised her claws to touch her stomach. She bent her eyes and looked at him with a smile. "I'm pregnant with your child."

"..."

Chu Xiaoye's body froze. He widened his eyes and looked at her in a daze.

"I was lying to you\! Hahahaha…"

Alisa suddenly opened her mouth and let out a terrifying strange laugh.

"Whoosh…"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly seemed to have collapsed. His body swayed and he almost fell to the ground.

This joke was not funny at all.

Lions had a low fertility rate, so they had to mate many times a day. Furthermore, they had to mate for many days before they could get pregnant.

Although the two of them had been intimate before, it had only been a few times. How could she be pregnant?

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief and ignored him. He looked back at the super huge tree and strode away, never looking back again.

Alisa stood on the riverbank, raised her head, and faced the cold wind and snow. She watched as his figure gradually disappeared into the distance.

Then, she lowered her head and looked at her stomach, her gaze becoming blurry.

"Heh, how could I let you leave? Idiot\!"

She suddenly raised her head and jumped gently. She stepped on the snow and jumped to the other side.

The temperature fell very low.

The inch-long fur on Chu Xiaoye's body could not cover him from the wind and snow. His skin seemed to be exposed and was cold.

However, his heart was burning.

To him, who had previously soaked in the cold pool of the snow mountain, this cold was nothing.

"Perhaps, we should find a place to rest."

The little girl, who had walked from the sky to the morning and into the afternoon, suggested.

Her face was red from the cold, but her body, which was wearing a thin dress, did not seem to feel cold. She was still in high spirits and her clear and beautiful eyes blinked, as if she was talking.

Before Chu Xiaoye could answer, the big black bear stopped in its tracks. Its huge and sharp claws started to dig the ground hard. Soon, it dug an underground cave on the thick snow.

The big black bear brought her in and continued to dig.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the entrance of the cave and looked up into the distance.

The snow mountain was still very far.

He suddenly turned around and looked behind him.

His back was empty. Other than the snow, there was nothing.

"Alright, king, come down and rest. It'll be even colder outside at night. You don't have fur anymore. If you travel at night, you'll be frozen into an ice sculpture."

The little girl waved from below.

Chu Xiaoye looked behind him again and jumped down.

The cave was much warmer without the cold wind and snow.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not come down to avoid the snow.

Some things had to be asked clearly.

"Where are we going?"

He clearly expressed his intentions.

There had been no problem communicating with this little girl. It was even easier than communicating with his other lion companions.

This was very strange.

But now, the strange thing was not worth it.

There was something even stranger.

For example, why did this little girl's ears become a pair of sharp little ears? Why did this little girl suddenly seem to have become a different person?

"Go home."

The little girl's answer was very simple.

However, this answer made Chu Xiaoye even more confused.

Go home?

However, his home was in the grassland of the past and the grassland of the present.

He hoped that the little girl could say more and explain more.

Hence, he approached the little girl with a slightly angry gaze. His already fierce face looked even more ferocious.

The little girl shrugged, and her young face revealed self-mockery and thoughts that did not match her age. "You're asking me. Actually, I don't know either. I suddenly have many fragmented memories and suddenly feel that place is summoning me back. However, I'm sure that I'm not crazy."

Of course she was not crazy.

Chu Xiaoye knew this better than anyone.

However, what did that place summoning her have to do with him?

The little girl looked at him and said with certainty, "It's related to you too. I know that you belong there. Only there can you use your abilities and you can really find the meaning of life. You don't want to be an ordinary beast and deal with lions, hyenas, and antelopes all day long, right?"

"I want to."

Chu Xiaoye did not like her.

He hated the feeling of being dominated and manipulated.

"You don't want to\! I know."

The little girl was very certain again as she looked at him with a burning gaze. "You're ambitious and your heart is filled with flames. I can tell from the fur on your body that you're unwilling to be ordinary, and you'll definitely be extraordinary\! Believe me, after leaving here and going to where you should go, you'll definitely gain something\! At least, you can hold your head high and see humans openly."

"See humans?"

Chu Xiaoye was puzzled.

What was good about seeing humans? If he was willing, he could have seen humans long ago, and he had already seen humans.

"Yes, see humans\! At least you can crawl under humans endlessly in glory and become their mount\!"

The little girl said with certainty.

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

If he could open his mouth now, he wanted to curse and even hit someone.

He, the dignified lion king, did not live a good life and left with her after working so hard. Could it be that he wanted to suffer the humiliation of his crotch and be a human's mount?

Damn it\!

"I quit\!"

Chu Xiaoye stood up and prepared to leave, looking furious.

"The mount of a cute loli or a beautiful girl\!"

The little girl said seductively, "Just like Tibbs. Look how happy Tibbs is now\!"

Tibbs immediately grinned foolishly and wagged his tail happily. He fawned and expressed how happy he was. He was so happy.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up, raised his tail, and aimed his butt at the entrance.

Although with his lion king honor and manners, he could not beat up minors casually, he could still fart and make her faint.

Just as he was about to fart in anger, the little girl hurriedly said, "I was teasing you\! King, come down quickly. I'll tell you what you want to know."

"Pfft—"

With an explosion, black fog sprayed and instantly filled the entire cave below\!

Chu Xiaoye flicked his sharp claws and waved them at the entrance of the cave, preventing them from jumping up.

"Ugh —"

The big black bear was the first to vomit.

Then, the little girl vomited too.

"Boom\!"

Unexpectedly, right at this moment, the entire ice cave could not withstand the smelly fart airflow and temperature just now and collapsed\!

The vomiting big black bear and little girl were buried inside.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. Just as he was about to go down and dig out the ice, the little girl rode on the big black bear and broke out of the ice. She jumped up from below, still vomiting.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them, turned around, and pretended to leave.

The little girl immediately stopped vomiting and said loudly, "Over there, you can become friends with humans, sign a contract with them, become their life and death companions, or be high and mighty and become their master and king\!"

"The king there is the true king\!"

"The Beast Empire—the empire of humans and all animals\!"

"Ugh —"

The little girl continued to vomit after being impassioned.

The Beast Empire?

Including the empires of humans and all animals?

Although Chu Xiaoye was already mentally prepared and prepared to accept any absurd and strange things, this news still shocked him.

Now, he was sure that he was no longer in his previous world.

Then, was the snow mountain in front still the same as before?

The little girl leaned over and blinked her beautiful big eyes. Her face was red as she said a little embarrassed, "King, actually, what I want to ask is, do you mind crawling under Annie's skirt like Tibbs and becoming her mount?"

"Pfft—"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and let out a second fart\!

The little girl's eyes widened from the wind. Her golden hair fluttered and her skirt fluttered. She fell to the ground and vomited again.

The big black bear's heart ached so much that it trembled.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and looked behind again.

He saw a familiar figure flash and enter the underground cave.

The figure that followed him everywhere and was always by his side.

Catherine came too.
