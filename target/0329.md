Chapter 329: The Lion King's Pearl Necklace

With pearls in his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye inexplicably thought of a scene in Stephen Chow's movie, "Forbidden City Cop."

Ling Ling-Fat had steel balls in his mouth and turned them into cannonballs. They shot out with astonishing might that no one could block.

Then, could he stuff this pearl into the back and suddenly spray out a stream of air when fighting the enemy, using this pearl as a bullet to shoot at the enemy?

That was entirely possible\!

However, pearls were not steel. If they exploded before they could be sprayed, it would be troublesome.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, Tilly, who had gained nothing, immediately roared angrily and chased in the direction they left in with a murderous look.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly brought Little Curly Tail and the other two out of the bushes and followed behind her.

Unexpectedly, Tilly chased for a while before suddenly stopping in the grass and walking around curiously.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. There was a green vine-like plant in the grass, and there was a huge green ball-like fruit on it.

When he looked carefully, the fruit was covered in green patterns. It was a watermelon\!

"Bam\!"

Tilly slapped the watermelon into pieces.

The red melon flesh was revealed and juice flowed. A sweet smell was lost in the air.

This wild watermelon was already ripe\!

Chu Xiaoye looked straight at the bright red melon and juice and could not help but swallow his saliva. In the end, he actually swallowed the pearl in his mouth with a gulp\!

"Roar—"

He was shocked and could not be bothered to hide anymore. He immediately jumped out of the bushes and retched hard, but he could not vomit.

Tilly turned around and looked at him in shock.

Catherine, Mei Mei, and Little Curly Tail also got up from the bushes with embarrassed expressions.

Chu Xiaoye retched for a while. Seeing that it was already too late, he could only give up. He raised his head and looked at the broken watermelon.

He had not seen it for a long time. How did it taste?

Tilly immediately roared angrily and ran over, looking fiercely at his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth and swayed left and right, indicating that it was really gone.

Tilly looked fiercely at Catherine, Mei Mei, and Little Curly Tail behind her.

Catherine was stunned for a moment and could only open her mouth to show her.

Mei Mei also opened her mouth.

Only Little Curly Tail raised his head and stuck out his chest. He looked askance and looked disdainful.

Tilly came to his side and raised her claws, glaring at him fiercely. She looked fierce as if she would tear his mouth open if he did not open it\!

Thinking of the ferocity and strength of the female cub, Little Curly Tail could only open his mouth reluctantly for her to check.

Tilly saw that the pearl was indeed gone and immediately looked dejected.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked in front of the broken watermelon. He looked at the familiar bright red flesh with a complicated gaze. In the end, he could not help but lower his head and lick it.

Immediately, a sweet taste flowed down his tongue and into his throat.

His body trembled and he continued to lick it.

This was his mother. Oh, no, this was the smell of summer.

Although his taste buds and preferences had changed drastically, he still remembered this taste clearly and could not forget it.

Occasionally, lions would eat grass and wild fruits, especially when they were constipated or had parasites in their stomachs.

Now that the pearl had entered his stomach, in order to pull it out, Chu Xiaoye decided to let go of himself for the time being and taste the deliciousness of his previous life.

Seeing that he was eating with relish, Mei Mei hurriedly came over and licked it a few times. However, she realized that it was not the taste she wanted and immediately lost interest.

Seeing that the watermelon juice was like fresh meat and blood, Little Curly Tail also came over to lick it. Then, he retched and almost vomited.

He hated this smell\!

Chu Xiaoye slapped him away and gestured for Catherine to come and try.

Catherine walked close, lowered her head, and licked it carefully. However, she was stunned. She licked it a few more times and realized that it was very delicious.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and rubbed her head to show his appreciation.

Tilly also leaned over and lowered her head to lick a few times. However, the corner of her mouth twitched and she felt like vomiting. However, she suddenly bit a piece, including the meat and skin, and swallowed it with a look of enjoyment.

Then, she narrowed her eyes and raised her head, waiting for praise.

In the end, Chu Xiaoye was lowering his head and eating a watermelon, not looking at her.

Tilly was furious, but she raised her claws and rubbed his head gently to show her appreciation.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her and she fell to the ground.

He could not touch the tiger's butt or the lion king's head, did he not know?

Furthermore, the female cub had just used her claw to dig at his vomit. Was she deliberately wiping his head?

This bastard\!

Tilly lay on the ground with a wronged expression. Her eyes trembled and were filled with tears.

Unfortunately, no one watched her performance.

After Chu Xiaoye finished eating the watermelon, he turned around and left, preparing to find a quiet place to wait for excrement.

However, there seemed to be no movement in his stomach.

At this moment.

The night retreated and the sun quietly rose.

It was time to find the injured black lion king.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

Soon, they stepped into the territory of another pride.

This pride had three black lions.

Two of them were marking the territory. When they heard the noise, they immediately roared angrily and ran over.

The resentment in Tilly's heart immediately turned into anger and strength. She rushed up with a whoosh and swung her golden claws. The two clearly too fat lions fell to the ground.

Tilly still could not vent her anger. She rubbed the heads of the two black lions in front of Chu Xiaoye. Then, she removed the heads of the two black lions and raised her head, looking at Chu Xiaoye threateningly.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly extended his claws and rubbed her head to show his appreciation.

Tilly narrowed her eyes in comfort.

When she opened her eyes, she realized that everyone had already gone far away.

After the other black lion saw them from afar, it immediately abandoned the female lions and young cubs and fled alone.

Before Chu Xiaoye could attack, Catherine had already rushed into the lionesses. She waved her silver claws and slaughtered them\!

Little Curly Tail also rushed up. "Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!" He used his tail to slap the pitiful black cubs to death, thereby avoiding being cut open by Catherine.

After killing this pride, Chu Xiaoye continued forward with the team.

This time, they encountered a lion alliance formed by ten black lions.

These ten black lions relied on their strong bodies and numbers to crush them. They were not afraid and rushed up in an encirclement.

In the end, before Chu Xiaoye could attack, Little Curly Tail and the others had beaten them to the ground. Some had their heads broken, some had their necks broken, and some had their stomachs cut open. They were all dead.

Chu Xiaoye was now certain that the black lion king was not dead.

The other party might be commanding these black lions to stall for time so that he could have more time to heal.

The scent left behind by the thirty-over lions was still very clear.

Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry to advance. It was not just the black lion king. Every black lion tribe in every territory was a target he wanted to kill.

For the sake of the peace of the grassland, he had to eliminate the roots and not let anyone go.

Soon, another group of black lions fell into a pool of blood.

This time, the black lions finally could not restrain themselves and gathered more than twenty lions at once. There were lions and female lions. Under the lead of one of the powerful lions, they pounced over.

Chu Xiaoye personally attacked and only used two rounds to crush the black lion leader's head.

Of the other black lions, only two female lions escaped. The rest were killed by Little Curly Tail and the others.

It was already evening.

They spent the entire day fighting.

The forest ahead was already at the edge of the oasis.

There was a strong lion aura floating there and the cold killing intent that was different from those of ordinary black lions.

Obviously, the black lion king was hiding there.

Furthermore, more and more powerful black lions were gathered there.

Perhaps, there were still all sorts of ambushes.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the setting sun that had fallen to the horizon, then looked back at Little Curly Tail and the others who were covered in blood. Just as he was about to continue forward in one go, a bang suddenly came from the forest in front of him.

Just as a wild rabbit that had smelled their scent was escaping in a hurry, it suddenly missed and fell into a deep pit.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the trap in surprise.

On the trap were some fresh branches and the note was full of dense green leaves. It was obvious that they were bushes and some branches that had just been picked.

It was obvious to him that these things were placed on the ground, but most other animals would not sense it.

The black lion king was taking the time to heal and clearly would not think of this.

In other words, there were still some experts or some intelligent lions among the black lions that he did not know.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail roared from the side and grinned, indicating his ridicule for the black lions.

This trap was too low-level. The traps that their brother had once taught them to make were filled with grass on the ground at the top and were at the same height as the surrounding terrain. It was difficult to discover. Even if it was them, if they did not remember the location, they would not be able to tell. And the traps these fellows made were an insult to his brother's intelligence\!

He was worlds apart from his brother\!

Chu Xiaoye walked forward and looked carefully. He saw that the rabbit was jumping around in panic at the bottom of the pit. The bottom of the pit was empty. Other than mud, there was nothing.

He looked up again.

There was more than one such trap. Furthermore, there might be other traps.

He would not look down on any opponent.

Furthermore, the strength of that black lion king was above his.

The sun was about to set and night was not a good time for them to attack.

He should wait for tomorrow.

Tomorrow was also the last day.

He jumped down the trap and picked up the wild rabbit in his mouth. He jumped up gently and let go of the wild rabbit, letting it leave.

There was still no movement in his stomach, no urge to excrement.

This was good too.

Let the pearl continue to stay inside.

When he killed the black lion king tomorrow, he would use the other party's super lion king tendon to make a pearl necklace and give it to…

He turned around and looked at Catherine, Mei Mei, and Little Curly Tail…
