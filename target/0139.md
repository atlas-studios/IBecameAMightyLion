Chapter 139: Lion Alliance

"Roar\!"

They roared angrily and charged bravely at the seven female lions\!

Then.

In less than a minute, they were bitten to the ground by the seven lionesses who were protective of their cubs.

Then, they fled.

They stood not far away, panting, their faces covered in scratches and looking haggard.

The seven female lions did not chase after them again. Instead, they looked at the young male cub in front of them in fear and anxiety.

The strength of this little lion was the most terrifying\!

According to the rules of their race, if he defeated their king, he would be qualified to be their new king.

However, they would never allow him to hurt their children.

They decided to continue fighting\!

However, to their surprise and confusion, this young male cub did not look at their children or them much. Instead, he walked to a nearby bush and lay down.

Then, he closed his eyes and started to sleep.

They were stunned and did not know what to do.

The little elephant also walked into the bushes happily as if there were no lions beside it. It raised its nose and started to look for leaves to eat.

The atmosphere was a little strange.

The two lions that had fainted quickly woke up.

They got up from the ground and looked at the lionesses, the cubs, and the two wandering lions in the distance. Finally, they looked at the sleeping cub.

They looked confused and did not know what to do.

Should they continue to charge up and fight, or should they be sensible and take the initiative to leave the territory, abandon this home, and abandon the lionesses and children?

Comparing living and territory, they would naturally choose to continue living.

Even if they had to go out to wander.

However, the current situation confused them.

The cub that had defeated them did not kill their cubs, nor did it bite them to death. It did not even chase them away. Instead, it lay in the bushes and slept.

What did this mean?

Amidst the uneasiness and confusion of the pride, the night quietly passed.

After dawn.

Chu Xiaoye opened his eyes and stood up from the bushes.

The two adult lions immediately trembled in fear. They did not dare to go up nor were they willing to run. They stayed in place, not knowing what to do.

The seven female lions hurriedly protected the cubs behind them.

The two wandering lions not far away stood up and looked at him with burning eyes.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at them but ignored them. He turned around and looked at the little elephant before leaving.

The little elephant had eaten leaves for the entire night and was still using its nose to curl the leaves to eat. Seeing that he left without saying goodbye, it hurriedly put away its nose and followed him.

The two wandering lions hurriedly followed behind.

Looking at this strange combination gradually walking further and further away, the two wandering lions were in a daze and finally heaved a sigh of relief.

It turned out that the cub did not intend to occupy their territory or the female lions at all. It only came to the territory to stay for a night.

They stood there trembling in fear for the entire night, thinking about their future wandering lives. Damn it\!

If not for the fact that he was underage, they would not let him off easily\!

Three days later.

They were getting closer and closer to the majestic mountain range they had previously seen.

The blurry mountain peak gradually became clear.

From afar, the top of the mountain was bare and flat. As for the waist and the foot of the mountain, they were lush and filled with trees.

It looked like a volcano that had once erupted.

At this moment, the river at the foot of the hill was finally connected. It was no longer intermittent, but the river water was only a shallow layer and could no longer flow downstream.

On both sides of the river, there were more sparse grass and green trees. They finally added some life to the gradually withering river.

The animals that could occupy the territory here, be it carnivores or herbivores, were all powerful.

The weak could only survive in the downstream where there was no water source. They were not qualified to share the survival resources here with them.

Be it upstream or downstream, there was competition everywhere.

There was competition among the weak in the downstream and the weakest was eliminated.

There was also competition among the strong in the upper reaches, leaving the strongest behind.

No matter where, only the stronger could survive best.

Lions, hyenas, zebras, antelopes, and even all sorts of wild rabbits and vipers had their own territory. They had to rely on their strength to defeat their competitors and occupy the best territory.

If they wanted to live, they had to make themselves stronger.

Chu Xiaoye's dream was to find the best territory, defeat those strong competitors, and occupy the throne. Then, he would go back and bring Little Curly Tail and his mother over.

However, clearly, the land he saw now was not his ideal territory.

Although there was water and food here, he was not satisfied.

He needed to continue searching.

However, before that, he needed to eat his fill.

He had not eaten for three days and was a little hungry.

The prey here should be very abundant.

At the foot of the hill.

When the herbivores were squeezing by the river to drink water and the carnivores were waiting not far away, the noisy scene suddenly quietened down.

Because they saw a young lion slowly walking over while riding a little elephant.

Not far behind them were two adult lions.

Chu Xiaoye stared at the group of herbivores with a burning gaze and was looking for targets fat and thin.

The little elephant suddenly stopped and walked to the river. It raised its nose and called out, signaling him to come down.

It needed to drink water.

Furthermore, in this hot weather, elephants would usually use their noses to suck up mud and spray it on themselves to stop the sun and cool down. They could also prevent some parasites.

It knew that it still had to continue traveling under the hot sun in a while, so it prepared to apply a layer of sunscreen.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from its back, his gaze still searching among the prey.

He had a big appetite.

This time, he planned to catch three prey and place them on the elephant's back.

Anyway, the little stupid elephant was strong and did not care.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was about to attack, water suddenly flew up from the river behind him\!

Then, the little elephant, who was sucking water with its nose, suddenly raised its head and pulled its nose hard, letting out an angry cry.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw an old crocodile covered in mud. It was looking up and biting its nose\!

The other crocodiles beside him immediately swam over.

Not far away, the animals crowded around the river immediately retreated in fright\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and jumped up high without hesitation, quickly landing on the old crocodile\!

"Bang\!"

He suddenly slapped the old crocodile's eye\!

Then, he landed on the old crocodile's back and raised his palm again to slap its other eye\!

"Bang\!"

The old crocodile's two eyeballs exploded from his slap and blood splashed\!

The moment the old crocodile opened its mouth in pain, he suddenly jumped up the shore\!

At this moment, the other crocodiles that had rushed over suddenly jumped up and pounced at the place he had just stood. They missed and lay on the old crocodile's back\!

The old crocodile's eyes were bleeding as it fled in fear.

The other crocodiles were stunned for a moment before they immediately chased after him\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the shore and tiptoed, rubbing his feet on the ground and wiping the mud on it.

The other animals not far away, be they herbivores or carnivores, were stunned by the scene of him jumping into the water and blowing up the crocodile's eyeballs.

This gave him a chance.

"Whooshâ€”"

He suddenly rushed out without warning and pounced on a gazelle. He pushed it to the ground and bit its throat\!

The other gazelles beside him immediately fled in panic.

Just as these animals thought that he would stop here, he suddenly rushed out with a whoosh and bit the throat of another gazelle\!

He brought the two gazelles back and placed them on the back of the elephant.

Just as the other gazelles were heaving a sigh of relief, who knew that this greedy cub would suddenly charge over at lightning speed again before it was satisfied\!

Soon, he picked up a third gazelle and jumped onto the elephant's back.

The remaining gazelles no longer dared to drink water. They hurriedly jumped away and fled the place.

Chu Xiaoye pried open the limbs of the three gazelles and let them overlap on the elephant's back. As for him, he rode on them and started to enjoy the delicious meal.

When he bit the neck of a gazelle and threw its head and neck away, the two wandering lions following behind immediately ran up excitedly. As they wolfed down the food, they lowered their eyes and wagged their butts at him in a fawning manner, looking like two pugilists.

After the little elephant drank the water, its nose hurt. It did not dare to breathe in mud again. It carried him and turned to leave.

Chu Xiaoye threw meat as he ate.

The two wandering lions followed behind happily and gratefully. Seeing him turn around, they immediately turned their butts in a fawning manner. When they saw him looking in front, they bared their fangs and glared fiercely at the other animals around them.

They seemed to be saying, "What are you looking at? Have you never seen such a handsome boss and mighty bodyguards?"

At this moment, all the animals by the river hurriedly made way and stood not far away, looking at them in a daze.

A few hungry wild dogs followed carefully behind them, seemingly wanting to pick up some meat that the cub had thrown away to eat, but they were chased away by the two wandering lions ferociously.

Looking at their triumphant and flaunting appearance, it was as if they were more honored than being lion kings\!

At the same time.

A few kilometers ahead, in a lush forest, a super strong male alliance formed by five wandering lions was slaughtering the cubs in a pride.

The king of the pride had already been cut open and turned into a corpse.

As for the female lions in the pride, they were riddled with wounds from being bitten. They were trembling not far away as they watched helplessly as their young children were killed by this group of butchers.

They were powerless.
