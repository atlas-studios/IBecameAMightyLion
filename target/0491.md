Chapter 491: Lion-human Fight\!

"Roar\!"

The roar of the saber-toothed tiger was deafening.

It revealed a fierce face, wanting to scare away this reckless elf.

However, Annie held the knife and did not retreat.

Behind Annie, there was a big black bear that bared its fangs.

The saber-toothed tiger was angered. It widened its eyes in anger and roared as it pounced forward.

However, just as it jumped up, Vilis, who was beside it, suddenly spun and swung the huge sword in her hand. With a whoosh, she cut into its neck and cut off its huge tiger head from its body\!

"Bam\!"

Blood splashed\!

The saber-toothed tiger's huge body fell to the ground and its head was cut off\!

"Vilis…"

This sudden scene shocked the Elven Knight, Lori, and he could not accept it.

Vilis stuck the huge sword into the ground, her silver hair flowing like a waterfall.

She looked at him coldly and said, "Lord Lori, I'm under orders to protect the princess. This is the queen's orders, you should know."

"But this saber-toothed tiger…"

Vilis interrupted him. "There are no buts. Lord Lori, I think you should leave. I need to explain something to the princess and bring her to the palace to see the queen. I won't have time to entertain you anymore."

The muscles in the corner of Lori's eyes twitched as she revealed undisguised anger.

However, he looked angrily and hatefully at Annie and the two lions behind her.

"Hmph, impostor, wait and see\!"

He said those words without any gentlemanliness and left with his walking stick.

He had a noble status and had made many contributions. He had risked his life for the elves, bled and sweated. He had even lost a leg and was deeply favored by the queen. He did not believe that he could not deal with this impostor\!

As for Vilis, she was definitely in his pocket\!

"This fellow is loyal to Her Majesty and is quite strong. However, he will take revenge for the smallest grievance. You have to be careful in the future."

After the angry elf knight left, Vilis kindly reminded Annie.

Annie put the knife back and smiled. "I didn't kill his tiger. He should take revenge on you. Just because you're his sweetheart? That's not fair."

Vilis' face was cold as she looked at Chu Xiaoye and said, "Your Highness, I'll remind you one last time that trouble comes from your mouth. From now on, you can no longer call a lion king."

Annie looked indifferent. "Alright, I can promise you this. However, Vilis, does what you promised me count?"

Vilis knew what she was referring to and said coldly, "Of course it counts. I promised you that I would make him my mount or war beast. If he's willing."

Annie frowned and shook her head. "But you didn't tell me before that they need to sign a soul contract and you need to make him a slave or weapon. I can't agree to this."

Vilis did not back down and said, "Then let them leave. Go to the snow forest to survive, or be abducted by the orcs, mated, or killed."

Annie fell silent.

"What war beast?"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked to Annie's side and asked her with his gaze.

The communication between them could be done with a glance and a move.

Annie shook her head and looked at Vilis. She asked, "Alice, can you explain to us specifically what a war beast is?"

Vilis said, "Of course. As the name implies, battle beasts are ferocious beasts that can fight. They can be warriors who risk their lives to protect and fight when their owner needs them. They will live and die with their owner and never retreat or survive."

Annie looked at Chu Xiaoye and asked, "Then, must the warbeast sign a soul contract?"

Vilis sneered and said, "Is there a need to ask? If we don't sign a soul contract, who can guarantee that it won't retreat at the last moment or turn against us at the last moment? War beasts are our closest and most intimate companions. We live with each other every day and have no secrets between us. If it defects, you should be able to imagine the consequences without me saying, right?"

Annie nodded and looked at her king.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment, his eyes flickering as he let her pass the message.

Annie was stunned for a moment, seemingly hesitating, but she still said, "Vilis, he won't sign a contract with you. However, he can help you fight once or do something very important as payment."

She paused for a moment and said with a determined gaze, "They need to stay here and also have to stay here. First, protect me and help me kill that… Annie. Second, they need to find themselves. If they leave, I will leave too, Vilis. I will never help you."

Vilis frowned and tightened her grip on the sword hilt, looking at her coldly.

Annie looked at her without fear or retreat.

The atmosphere froze. It was silent and no one spoke again.

About ten minutes later, Vilis relaxed her brows and said, "Alright, I promise you."

Just as Annie smiled, she suddenly held her sword with both hands and placed the huge sword on her shoulder. She passed her and walked in front of Chu Xiaoye. She said coldly, "However, the prerequisite is that I have to personally test if he's qualified to fight for me."

Annie was about to speak when Alice immediately called out her name coldly. "Annie, if you don't agree to this condition, I can't do anything. You will be forced to stay, and they will be expelled."

Annie looked at her king, as if she had become the nervous and helpless little girl again.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her gently, as if he had comforted her in the past to show that he was okay.

Then, he nodded at the huge sword elf in front of him and wrote two letters on the ground with his claws. "OK\!"

The corner of Vilis' mouth curled up slightly as she took a few steps back. Her blue eyes were filled with anticipation as she held the hilt of her sword with both hands and said, "Baldy, I hope you won't disappoint me."

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye walked over.

He hated being called bald\!

His movements were as fast as lightning and his golden claws were as bright as shooting stars\!

Vilis' eyes lit up. She suddenly exerted strength on her slender waist and turned beautifully. The huge sword on her shoulder swung out with a whoosh\!

Even if it was just a competition, she would still be merciless.

"Bzzt—"

The golden claw and the blade of the huge sword collided heavily, causing a series of sparks\!

The lion and man passed by each other.

Chu Xiaoye jumped past them, and Vilis turned around and brushed past them at an extremely fast speed\!

They changed directions and looked at each other again.

For the first time, Vilis could not hide her smile and excitement.

Her silver hair fluttered and her fighting spirit grew stronger\!
