Chapter 459: Untitled

The night was silent.

In the tree hole, the black shadow swayed the two tentacles and had already climbed onto the little girl's neck.

A faint fragrance emitted from its body and entered the little girl's nose.

The little girl slept even more soundly.

This time, this black shadow did not suck the little girl's breath like last night. Instead, it wrapped tightly around the little girl's entire body.

Then, its body that was hanging at the entrance of the cave gradually straightened and started to pull back.

The little girl's body was slowly dragged towards the hole.

All of this happened silently.

The pride under the tree hole seemed to be unaware, and the little girl was even more unaware.

However, just as the black shadow dragged the little girl out of the hole, the big black bear, who was sleeping under the tree root, suddenly trembled. It seemed to have sensed something and immediately raised its head to look up, just in time to see the little girl being dragged up\!

"Roar\!"

The big black bear immediately let out a deafening roar and jumped up, climbing up the tree root.

The other members around him were woken up.

When the black shadow saw that it was discovered, it immediately accelerated and quickly dragged the little girl up.

Right at this moment, the big black bear's huge body suddenly jumped up from the root like a ball with a whoosh. It opened its bloody mouth and suddenly bit the thick black shadow that was taut above the little girl's head\!

"Bam\!"

The black shadow was immediately bitten off\!

The little girl fell vertically and was bitten by Mei Mei, who had rushed over from the cave. She landed steadily on the ground.

The big black bear could not control its body. After biting the black shadow, it landed vertically. With a bang, it fell heavily to the ground. However, its skin was thick and its flesh was rough. It seemed to be fine. It immediately turned around and jumped up. It ran to the little girl's side and raised its head to roar at the black shadow.

The black shadow that it had bitten off seemed to twist and sway a few times in pain. Then, it quickly retreated and soon disappeared.

At this moment, the members of the pride who had heard the noise surrounded the little girl.

On the little girl's body, there was actually a thick vine that was like a python tightly tied. The roots of the vine were bare, and only the front end had two green leaves. They were like antennae and were still twisting in pain\!

Just as Mei Mei was about to use her claws to cut off this terrifying green vine, she saw that the two green leaves were actually withering at a visible speed. Soon, they turned yellow and drooped. The stem that was tightly wrapped around the little girl's body suddenly seemed to have lost all its life force and water. It quickly withered and turned into a withered old branch that would break at a touch.

The big black bear hurriedly extended its claws and carefully pulled the withered vines on the little girl down.

The little girl was still sleeping soundly, as if she did not know what was happening to her.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the low growl of the Jerry brothers suddenly came from outside the tree hole.

However, soon, the two brothers' growls became gentle.

Chu Xiaoye finally returned with Catherine and Alisa.

At this moment, the sky was already bright. A night quietly passed.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately ran over excitedly and rubbed against their brother. Although they trusted their brother's strength very much, they were still very afraid and worried. Now that they saw their brother coming over safely, they were naturally happy.

The members of the pride gathered warmly to welcome him.

After Chu Xiaoye greeted them one by one, he finally looked at the little girl lying on the ground.

Although the big black bear was jealous of him, it trusted his ability very much. It hurriedly stood up and let out a low growl. It danced around and described what had happened previously angrily, then begged him to save its owner.

This fellow had already degraded himself and took the initiative to treat this human girl as his master.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the little girl and looked at the broken withered vines on the ground, then stared at the little girl's entire body. Suddenly, his gaze changed. He extended his claws and grabbed the little girl's dress, grabbing a trace of amber mucus.

He was shocked. He jumped onto the tree root at the side with a whoosh and climbed up, quickly entering the cave.

His eyes flickered with golden light as he searched the ground carefully. Indeed, he found some more mucus.

He was very familiar with the mucus. It was something the super huge tree above him secreted on the tree trunk to protect him.

Could it be that the vine that wanted to abduct the little girl did not come from the surrounding bushes but climbed down from the tree above?

If that was the case, where was the root of the vine?

When he climbed this super tree previously, he did not find any other plants on the tree trunk, other than the thick mucus.

Could it be…

Another possibility suddenly flashed in Chu Xiaoye's heart.

Perhaps, it was not a vine that wanted to abduct the little girl. How could a vine have such intelligence and methods?

If that was the case, not only did ancient giant dinosaurs and saber-toothed tigers exist in this world, even demons did\!

How was this possible?

Perhaps the kidnapper was an animal with great intelligence, such as an ape or something. It brought a vine and quietly slipped down, tying the little girl up and preparing to abduct her. After being discovered by the big black bear, it fled alone.

That was indeed a possibility.

However, why did the broken part of the vine suddenly wither? Also, why were the mucus that should have appeared on the tree on the little girl's body and on the ground here?

If it was really an animal, how did it get stained with those things and be fine?

Of course, this world was filled with all sorts of strange things. Perhaps some animals could secrete something under their feet in order to adapt to this tree and ignore the mucus, just like how spiders ignored their sticky webs.

Chu Xiaoye thought as he walked out of the tree hole and looked up.

Many gaps of all sizes appeared above his head, looking like strange mouths waiting for their prey to take the initiative to enter.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up, crawled out of a gap, and climbed up the roots of the super tree.

He could smell the faint scent on the little girl and the smell of the mucus. It should be left behind by the kidnapper.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the top of this super giant tree and was secretly shocked. The abductor had really fled to the top of the giant tree. From the looks of it, its nest was probably above\!

What was it?

"Ga\! Ga—"

Right at this moment, a few crow-like cries suddenly came from the tree above him. They sounded very panicked.

Then, the cries stopped.

A feather drifted down.
