Chapter 392: Untitled

Chu Xiaoye regretted it.

However, there were some things he had held in for a very long time that needed to be communicated or poured out, even if he could only do so briefly.

He was a lion, but he did not want to forget everything about humans.

As for this little girl, she was originally a human. She could not forget her past just because she lived in a pride.

Perhaps many things that humans had in the past could help her grow better here. Perhaps one day, she would find a chance to leave.

Chu Xiaoye wanted to remind her that she was still a human, a human with a long history of civilization and endless intelligence and strength.

At her age, perhaps she did not know much, but here, those things were definitely the most precious wealth.

Perhaps one day, she could rely on those things to become stronger.

She was not a beast to begin with, so why should she be like a beast?

Some things could be learned and had to be adapted to, but some things could be abandoned and resolved in a more mature and smart way that humans could use.

For example, farting.

When lions farted, they could fart whenever they wanted, regardless of whether their companions beside them were willing or not. When humans farted, they could temporarily hold it in and find a place with no one to fart or use other sounds to cover it.

This was wisdom.

No female would like sloppy and dirty fellows, especially those who liked to fart.

Lions were no exception.

Unless the other party's farts were world-shaking and mighty and could cause the enemy to tremble in fear and make their companions miss them day and night like those of a lion.

Therefore, wisdom was very important.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and walked into the forest at the side alone. He let out a long and mellow roar to challenge the enemy and fart silently.

This fart was very ordinary. It was not smelly or black. It was the first time he had farted the most normal, most beautiful, and refined fart since he became a lion.

He even suspected that his smelly farting skills had suddenly disappeared.

This made him very worried and uneasy.

If such a powerful skill was gone, it would be equivalent to losing an arm and being crippled.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at the pride's camp and walked further away. He aimed his butt at a bush and decided to try it quickly to see if the smelly fart was still there.

"Pfft—"

A black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind him like a hurricane. With a whoosh, it blew away the bushes at the back.

In the bushes, a female lion had a cold gaze. She bared her fangs, tensed up, and was ready to attack\!

However, in the next second, her fur suddenly stood on end, and her face was distorted. She widened her eyes and spat out a filthy thing with a puff. The killing intent all over her body was instantly sprayed away by the black gas.

Chu Xiaoye heard the noise and hurriedly jumped up and turned around.

"Ugh —"

The female lion vomited as she fled in panic. She was extremely fast\!

In the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the boundless night.

However, the heart-wrenching vomiting still echoed clearly in the dark forest and gradually disappeared.

"It's her?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned.

The lioness's face and figure were very familiar. She should be the lioness who had attacked his brother with the infectious disease. However, her eyes had returned to their original amber and were no longer that sickly and demonic scarlet.

What was going on?

Could it be that the terrifying virus that made the giant water buffalo crazy had been eliminated or digested by her?

Catherine seemed to have heard the noise and quickly ran over, but she did not see anything. She could only smell a lingering familiar smell.

She seemed to have gained immunity and was not afraid of his farts, let alone vomit after smelling them.

"I'm not farting. I'm just peeing."

Chu Xiaoye did not want to make the pride nervous. He raised his hind legs and peed in the bushes, not avoiding this female cub.

In front of this lioness cub, he did not have to care about his image or intelligence, let alone wear a fake mask. Because her life was his.

Catherine glanced at the water stream he shot out, lowered her head, and left silently.

After Chu Xiaoye finished peeing, he looked in the direction where the lioness fled and sneered in his heart. "The humiliation of my crotch that day, I'll return a small fart to you first. Next time, I'll definitely return a tooth for a tooth and make you scream for three days\! I'll make you wish you were dead\!"

In the forest a kilometer away, the female lion, Alisa, lay limp in the grass. She was already in living hell.

The fresh meat that she had eaten in the evening was vomited out now. She vomited until there was nothing in her stomach. She was still vomiting acid, and she seemed to be unable to stop.

If she had to say what she regretted the most in her life, it would definitely be the fart she had eaten while hiding in the bushes tonight\!

That was the first time she ate farts and the first time she knew that the fart of a lion could stink to that extent\!

It made her despair\! She started to doubt her life\!

This hatred was irreconcilable\!

Even if she died, she would make that little bastard suffer and live a life worse than death\!

When Chu Xiaoye returned to the camp, no one was asleep.

Callie's tragic death and the strength and mystery of the enemy worried every member of the pride.

The little girl's voice might be able to relax everyone for the time being, but it could not change anything.

Before Chu Xiaoye could climb up the tree, the little girl ran over and grabbed his tail tightly. Her blue eyes were bright as she blinked at him. Her little face was red as she whispered excitedly, "King, you can understand me, right?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her calmly without any expression.

"King, I know that you can definitely understand me. You know how to write and can definitely understand me, right?"

The little girl did not let up. She pulled his tail and asked excitedly and anxiously.

Chu Xiaoye grinned and raised his hind legs, preparing to kick her face and make her let go.

The little girl still did not let go and continued to tug at his tail, looking at him pitifully, as if she had fallen into a wolf pack. However, she suddenly realized that the wolf king was a husky puppy that was begging to be intimate.

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a moment. He suddenly felt that this little girl was quite pitiful. When people from the same hometown saw each other, their eyes would water, let alone in this situation.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to give her a chance and let her decide for herself if she really wanted to be his closest friend.

"Pfft—"

Black smoke suddenly spewed out from behind him, causing the little girl's golden hair to fly. Her eyes widened and she took a few steps back with a whoosh and fell to the ground.

The black smoke was like a ferocious black monster baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. It instantly enveloped the little girl's entire body and bullied her wantonly\!

Chu Xiaoye looked back and ignored her. With a whoosh, he climbed up the tree.

The black fog dispersed and the little girl lay on the ground with her eyes closed. She fainted.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was gloating, he suddenly saw a pair of cold eyes flash in the forest not far away\!
