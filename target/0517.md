Chapter 517: Leave No One Alive

He did not hold a sword.

When Fei'er picked up his sword from the ground and ran, wanting to rush in front of him, he suddenly lowered his body and became a lion.

It was no longer the bald lion, but a lion covered in golden fur.

Like a roaring flame in the canyon, the devil danced in the breeze and chanted a silent curse under the orc's miserable and desperate roar.

He jumped up and passed by the orc like a light.

It was as gentle as the wind and as dazzling as fire.

The orc's head fell to the ground.

Fei'er held her sword and froze in place.

The orcs' miserable cries and crazy roars still echoed in the canyon.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down.

He ran in the flames, jumped in the corpses, and raised his claws that were flickering with golden light under the despair of the orcs.

In a flash, his head fell to the ground\!

Fei'er held her sword and moved her slender and agile legs. She ran on the hill and chased after him with all her might.

But soon, he disappeared into the burning flames.

Fei'er's pink hair danced as she continued to chase on the hill. She shouted anxiously at the archer girl in front of her, "Protect Lord Night\! Protect Lord Night\!"

Perhaps she felt that no one could understand or see her and immediately shouted, "Protect that lion\! Protect that lion\!"

However, no one saw the figure that was like lightning and flames.

The deep canyon was already filled with flames and corpses. The number of orcs charging crazily towards the hill decreased.

The elven girls stood up from behind the rock and widened their eyes to look down, wanting to see the youth's figure clearly. However, they could not see anything. They could only see the burning flames and the charred corpse.

Chu Xiaoye moved through the flames, and the golden fur on his body danced like flames.

He did not feel hot, nor did he feel heat. The flames that devoured the orc corpses like devils did not seem to be able to burn a single fur on his body.

The golden claws were waving and the heads of the orcs that had yet to die rolled down one by one.

Blood dyed the canyon red, causing the flames to become even more scarlet.

At the entrance of the canyon, the fire wall had already weakened.

The orc corpses were piled densely on the ground.

In fear and despair, the orcs that had yet to die rushed over the fire wall crazily and ran towards the cliff in panic.

However, the three bridges that spanned the two sides of the cliff were no longer there.

What awaited them were the cold swords in the hands of the three elven girls.

Lanisi used her dagger to cut the arrows on her body and endured the pain as she stood up. She stood beside Annie and blocked the orcs' escape route.

The arrows on Denise were already finished.

She pulled out the ancient curved blade at her waist and protected the Queen.

The orcs rushed out one after another and fell at their feet.

Their arms were numb and their swords were blunt, but they still stood there like death gods, not letting go of a living orc.

Suddenly, a strong orc nearly three meters tall rushed out with flames and pounced at them.

Annie rushed up and slashed his thigh\!

However, he did not fall to the ground and continued to roar as he rushed forward. His majestic and strong body was like a small mountain as it ferociously collided with the crippled Lanisi and Denise at the side.

Lanisi raised the sword in her hand and pierced into his chest with a puff, but she was also sent flying.

Beside him, Denise made a beautiful spin and dodged the orc. Then, she grabbed an arrow stuck in the orc's waist. She ran a few steps and suddenly jumped up. She stepped on the orc's waist and jumped onto his head. She gently cut his neck with the curved blade in her hand and then fell, as light as a butterfly.

The tall orc roared and took a few steps forward. Then, with a bang, he fell to the ground and could not get up again.

At this moment, two other equally tall orcs brandished their maces and rushed out of the sea of fire.

Behind them was a group of orcs whose bodies were already charred.

They let out painful roars. Their eyes were red as they rushed towards the three elven girls crazily.

"Annie\! Denise\! Back off\!"

Lanisi lay on the ground, her bones in pain from the impact. She could not stand up and spat out blood. Seeing that the orcs were roaring and preparing to die together, she immediately shouted.

Behind them was a bottomless abyss. The three bridges had been destroyed and these orcs would never escape. There was no need for them to die with these orcs for the hatred and resentment in their hearts.

Annie retreated and ran towards her, dragging her sword.

Because the two tall orcs saw that she was injured and rushed over.

Denise also held her scimitar and ran over, protecting her.

Two tall people rushed over angrily with the charred orcs who wanted to die with them.

Annie gripped the hilt of her sword tightly and her face started to turn pale.

Denise retreated and leaned close to the queen behind her. The scimitar in her hand started to tremble.

Lanisi said anxiously, "Go quickly\! Don't care about me\!"

They had already won this battle and could not make unnecessary sacrifices.

"Annie\! Go\! Take over from me and continue to protect the elves\! From today onwards, you're the queen of the elves\! Denise\! I order you to bring Annie away\! Quick\!"

Lanisi shouted anxiously and struggled to sit up, but it was useless.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly rushed out of the burning fire wall. Like a bolt of lightning that cut through the night sky, it rushed over and arrived in the blink of an eye\!

Golden light flashed and his head fell to the ground\!

The running orcs could not resist at all. In the blink of an eye, their heads fell from their necks.

Only the two tall orcs rushed in front of the three elven girls.

Annie and Denise suddenly ran forward. Then, they suddenly jumped up and slashed at the necks of the two tall orcs with their swords and scimitars\!

They could not cut off the orc's head, but the sharp blade and saber light had already cut their throats\!

The two girls and the orc separated and landed on the ground.

However, even though the two orcs were seriously injured, they did not fall to the ground immediately.

Blood sprayed from their necks and their eyes were red. They still rushed towards Lanisi, who was lying on the ground.

Annie and Denise's expressions changed, but they could not save him in time.

"Whoosh\!"

The figure that had just rushed out of the fire wall flashed past them again like lightning. It was so fast that they could not see what it was.

Then, the figure rushed past the legs of an orc. The moment the two orcs sprayed out blood and fell heavily towards the queen, it suddenly turned into a snow-white figure, grabbed the queen on the ground, and rolled out.

"Bang\!"

The two tall orcs fell heavily to the ground. Their bodies twitched as if they were unwilling, but they could not get up again.

At this moment, Annie and Denise saw that the snow-white figure was actually a naked young elf.

"Chi\!"

He tore off the clothes on the queen's body and quickly tied them around his waist, blocking his embarrassed front and back.

However, he did not expect that the Queen was not wearing anything inside.

The Queen was wearing only one shirt\!

"This doesn't make sense\!"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He hurriedly got up from the queen and turned around, facing away from her and looking at the other two elf girls.

"Is there something wrong with your brains?"

His face was dark and he said angrily.

Annie and Denise immediately froze in place and looked at him nervously.

"What's wrong?"

Annie could not help but ask.

However, just as she asked this question, she suddenly realized and immediately lowered her head.

Yes, there was indeed something wrong with their heads.

This battle had clearly been won and the three bridges had clearly been destroyed, but they did not leave. Instead, they still stood here and placed themselves in danger for the hatred in their hearts. If he had not arrived in time just now, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"You can die if you want to, but please don't do it today after everyone has just won a battle. Don't do it today after others have paid with their lives in exchange for victory, okay?"

Chu Xiaoye said angrily.

Annie suddenly looked up at him.

The Queen behind him also said with a trembling voice, "Night, how many of our people have been sacrificed?"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and did not answer. He said with a wooden face, "No matter how many sacrifices are made, Your Majesty, if you die today, our victory will be meaningless. Do you know?"

Lanisi said in shame, "Sorry, Night, sorry…"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the three destroyed bridges. "Your Majesty, you've already done very well. Previously, I saw Dolma escape after being shot and thought that something had happened to you and that your mission had failed. I didn't expect that you would still destroy these three bridges. I should have let you bring some kerosene. That would have been easier."

Lanisi said in a low voice, "Night, all of this is thanks to you. If you did not let Denise and Annie help me, I'm afraid I would have fallen off the cliff and would be gone long ago."

The Queen folded her arms and covered her red hair. She looked at him with trembling eyes and said softly, "I, Lanisi, and every member of the elves will never forget today or you."

Chu Xiaoye's back was still serious and cold.

He suddenly turned around and said, "Your Majesty, I think you should forget about today and me. Just pretend that I did not come just now, let alone offend you and be bold enough to tear your clothes off. Can you do that?"

The Queen was stunned for a moment before she suddenly burst into laughter. Her smile was like a flower and her red hair trembled.

She suddenly removed the arm covering her chest and looked at him frankly with bright eyes. "Night, I won't care. I can't be more grateful. Why would I care about this? Even if you see it, so what? Your queen is not a petty and ungrateful person."

Chu Xiaoye looked at them again, turned around, and looked at the two elf girls in front of him. "Do you know your mistake?"

The two girls lowered their heads and knew their mistake.

Chu Xiaoye said with a dark face, "Since you know your mistake, then stop staring at my white body. Quickly go and find me a shirt\!"

Denise was about to leave when Fei'er ran over with his sword and clothes in her hand. She said while panting, "Lord… Lord Night, you… you ran so quickly…"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly waved his hand and urged, "Quickly hand it over\!"

Then, he said, "If you're not wearing clothes, you'll naturally run faster."

Fei'er hurriedly took the clothes and handed them to him. She widened her eyes and said in surprise, "Really? If I'm not wearing clothes, can I really run as fast as you? Can Fei'er do so too?"

"Yes."

Chu Xiaoye took the clothes and did not talk to her anymore. He immediately walked behind a rock not far away and changed his clothes.

Then, he took the Queen's torn clothes and walked to her side, placing them on her body. He confirmed again, "Your Majesty, I hope that my presumptuousness and rudeness just now did not make you hate me."

Lanisi sighed and looked at him. "Night, am I really so narrow-minded and petty in your heart?"

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "Most people in high positions are like this. I've seen too many superficial monarchs behind them."

Naturally, he had seen it in books.

Lanisi smiled bitterly and said, "Night, I promise you again that I'm not that kind of person. I, Lanisi, am not a petty and ungrateful person. I will never hate you for what happened just now. I can swear."

Chu Xiaoye waved his hand and said, "Forget it, it doesn't matter."

Anyway, he did not intend to stay here for long.

He had indeed promised the little girl to stay here and protect the elves. However, he had agreed as an elf youth, not as a lion.

Of course, he would not go back on his word.

At least, he wanted to make this land stop fighting and make the elves here never be in danger of being invaded and killed by the orcs again.

This might be difficult, but he would think of a way.

The promise was a mountain that pressed on his heart and shoulders, destroying all his freedom.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye would rather be a lion.

"Take care of the Queen. I'll go in and take a look."

Chu Xiaoye took his sword from Fei'er and turned to leave.

He climbed up the hill and entered the canyon from the hill.

After his figure disappeared, the three elf girls suddenly thought of the Queen, who was still lying on the ground.

Denise and Fei'er helped the queen up.

Annie tore off her skirt and covered the Queen's chest again.

Lanisi smiled bitterly and said, "This flexible armor is good, but you can't wear any clothes inside. I didn't expect to be ugly today. I don't care, but I'm afraid he cares."

Although Fei'er did not see that scene, she had guessed it. She blinked her big eyes and asked curiously, "Your Majesty, did Lord Night see your body? That should be what you care about. Lord Night should be secretly happy."

Lanisi sighed and looked at her. "Look, you think so too. Do you think I would care about such a small matter? Night did this to save me. Not only did he save me, he also saved you and the entire elf race. How could I care about such a small matter?"

Fei'er smiled and said, "That's true. We should all be grateful to Lord Night."

Annie, who had not spoken, suddenly said with a complicated expression, "Sister, there are many things in his mind, as if he has experienced many things and knows many schemes. He has only been here for a few days and has only known you for a few days. Therefore, it's natural to not trust you."

Lanisi looked worried.

Annie comforted her softly, "Sister, give him some time. I believe he will understand you and respect you from the bottom of his heart."

"Then."

Lanisi looked at her and said, "Annie, how can we make him stay and not leave immediately? I can tell that he'll be leaving soon."

Annie smiled and said, "Sister, you already have the answer in your heart. Why ask me?"

Lanisi also smiled, but it was a bitter smile. "I just want to confirm if my method is useful. You've been with him the longest. You should know a little about him."

Annie shook her head and said, "No one can really see through him, let alone me. The longer I spend time with him, the less I know about him and the more I feel that he's mysterious. Sister, have you seen a lion that was born and lived on the grassland that can write and use human schemes? Even a mutated ferocious beast would not be like this, right?"

Lanisi's eyes flickered and she said with a complicated expression, "Indeed, he doesn't look like a lion. Who could have thought of the outcome of this battle?"

"But, Sister."

Annie looked at her with a meaningful smile and said softly, "He's a male after all. Be it lions or elves, he can't change his gender and instincts, as well as his desire for the opposite sex. What do you think?"

Lanisi also looked at her and suddenly smiled. "That's right."

The flames were still burning, but peace had returned to the canyon.

The smell of roasted meat filled the air, causing Chu Xiaoye, who was walking on the hill, to drool.

This instinct and desire that had settled in his bones made him feel helpless.

He raised his palm and slapped himself twice, reminding himself that he was an elf now. How could a noble, handsome, and elegant young elf eat those disgusting orc corpses?

"Lord Night\! We won\!"

Along the way, the female elves greeted him excitedly, looking at him with admiration and gratitude with their bright eyes.

Chu Xiaoye nodded and smiled. "Yes, I won."

However, winning this battle did not mean that they could live peacefully here from now on.

There were still many orcs in the Bolton Kingdom. Their total annihilation this time would probably make them furious and prepare to take revenge crazily.

Chu Xiaoye came in front of Lisa's corpse and looked at the little girl's tender face and bloody miserable appearance. His heart trembled. He suddenly raised his head and said to the elven girls beside him, "We did win, but our companions died because of this. Girls, are you willing to follow me to a place without war, orcs, knives, and swords, and hatred?"

The girls looked at him in shock, not knowing what to do.

"Pfft\!"

A dagger suddenly pierced through his back and pierced through his body\!

"Sorry, Lord Night, I'm not a girl."

The figure behind him said coldly.
