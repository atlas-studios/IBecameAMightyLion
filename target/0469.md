Chapter 469: Long Live the King\!

"Whoosh…"

A cold wind howled and killing intent approached\!

The saber-toothed tiger narrowed its eyes and slowly stood up.

His roar did not summon his brother, but his enemy.

He had chased all the way here from under the huge tree. Clearly, this young lion, who he thought was small and weak previously, was determined to get his life.

He admitted that he had misjudged and underestimated the enemy.

This little thing's strength and courage really exceeded his expectations.

However, if this little thing wanted to kill him like this, it would be too naive and laughable.

Even if he was seriously injured, he was still invincible\!

The humiliation and pain from before made him even more fierce and powerful\!

"Roar\!"

A roar resounded through the night\!

The saber-toothed tiger pounced forward and swung its remaining half of its still huge and terrifying claws\!

"Bang\!"

The saber-toothed tiger fell to the ground and the remaining half of its claws were gone.

He roared and got up from the ground again, but he could not stand steadily and fell to the ground again.

Blood sprayed and pain assaulted him.

He roared miserably and finally started to feel fear.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of him, the light on his claws still flickering. The enemy's blood made these claws even brighter.

He raised his claws again.

Right at this moment, a huge black shadow suddenly walked out of the swamp beside him.

It was another saber-toothed tiger. It was taller, stronger, and looked more ferocious and powerful.

It appeared from the night and looked at the scene in front of it with cold eyes.

The saber-toothed tiger, who had lost a claw, immediately growled anxiously and excitedly at it, as if it had seen its savior, as if it was calling for something.

However, the even stronger saber-toothed tiger slowly stopped and stood more than ten meters away, looking at him calmly and coldly without making a sound.

The injured saber-toothed tiger became even more anxious. As it crawled on the ground, it growled, as if it was begging.

He suddenly raised his head and looked at Chu Xiaoye in front of him. He bared his fangs and roared fiercely, as if he was warning this little thing that he was his brother. If he died, no one would survive\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw fell without hesitation and pierced into his neck\!

The sharp claw glint cut his neck like it was cutting tofu\!

"Pfft—"

Blood sprayed and the tiger head landed\!

His strong body was still twitching in the pool of blood. The eyes on his head were wide with fear and unwillingness.

The tiger king of a generation died just like that.

As for his brother, the more powerful saber-toothed tiger that lived adjacent to him, he still stood there quietly like a stranger. He did not come to save him or take revenge for him.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at it and the light on his claws gradually extinguished.

The kinship of animals previously was not reliable. Be it territory, food, mates, or other small matters, they could make them fight or become enemies.

This saber-toothed tiger was clearly tired of its brother who lived next door by dividing its territory.

Only the strong were qualified to have their own territory.

Chu Xiaoye had killed its brother and was clearly more qualified to have that territory than its brother.

As for revenge, there was no need.

An animal that lived alone was most afraid of being injured. As for this young lion that had killed his brother, it did not look easy to deal with. Furthermore, there was a pair of cold eyes with killing intent in the darkness that were looking here again.

It did not need to take the risk.

As long as this young lion did not have designs on his territory.

Chu Xiaoye indeed had no intention of attacking his territory. He lowered his head and bit the bloody tiger head, then turned to leave.

The saber-toothed tiger watched as his figure gradually disappeared into the distance before looking at its brother again.

Without a head, there was only a headless corpse left.

However, this corpse was very big and should be enough for it to enjoy for a few days.

It was a waste not to eat his brother's meat.

The bloody corpse seemed to be telling it, "If you're my brother, come and eat me\!"

If it did not eat, it could only let those lowly hyenas, vultures, or maggots eat it. To an ancient ferocious beast, that was a humiliation.

Chu Xiaoye brought the tiger head and walked out of this territory. Then, he stopped and threw the tiger head in his mouth to the ground. He looked back at the darkness behind him, his eyes flickering with golden light, and he let out a dignified growl.

"Come here and bite\!"

Catherine lowered her head and obediently walked out of the night. She came in front of him and obediently bit the tiger head.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to reprimand her, but seeing how docile she was, he could only give up. He could only glare angrily and pretend to be serious. "If you're disobedient again, I'll slap you\!"

Catherine lowered her head and did not say anything. She looked obedient but was stubborn.

She had been like this since she was young.

This saber-toothed tiger had already been beheaded. Then, logically speaking, his territory should have been changed by the victor.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not interested.

A territory that was too big could only bring with it too much trouble. Now was not the time to expand the territory.

At least, he had to completely settle his territory first.

There was definitely a secret hidden on that huge tree. The thing that had attacked the human girl had to be found and dealt with. Otherwise, staying there would be dangerous at any time.

When Chu Xiaoye returned to the camp with the saber-toothed tiger's head, everyone had yet to rest.

After what happened during the day, the pride was still extremely nervous and uneasy. Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others were patrolling vigilantly outside to prevent a tragedy from happening again.

Chu Xiaoye only used two hours to return from going out. However, he brought back the head of the terrifying attacker. This made the frustration and fear of the pride immediately dissipate.

Everyone pulled themselves together again, feeling excited.

Animals did not know how to cheer and could only use their limbs to express their admiration and respect for this young lion king.

This way, it would inevitably reduce the atmosphere.

At this moment, the little girl's use appeared.

"Our king is mighty\! Our king is domineering\! Long live our king\!"

The little girl clapped and cried out in joy. Her voice was very loud and her movements were very happy, like a little sparrow jumping on a branch and chirping.

Everyone was shocked by her actions and voice and looked at her in a daze, not understanding what she meant.

"Roar\!"

With a roar, the big black bear, who was originally lying motionless on the ground, suddenly sat up and actually slapped its palms too. It echoed the little girl's voice and let out a roar.

It seemed to be saying, "Our king is mighty\! Our king is domineering\! Long live our king\!"
