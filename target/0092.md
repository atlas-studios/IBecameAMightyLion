Chapter 92: Mutation

After dark.

The pride set off to hunt.

When he passed by the forest, Chu Xiaoye looked around carefully and did not see the mother and daughter pair of leopards.

Obviously, they had already left.

The water bag full of water seemed to have been taken away too.

All that was left was the skeleton of the old crocodile, covered in flies and bugs.

A small grayish-yellow lizard crawled in the bones and ate those small bugs non-stop.

It had a pair of large ears and a long and hard fur on its back. Its entire body was covered in sharp thorns. It looked rather strange and did not look like an ordinary lizard.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it carefully. Just as he was about to leave with the pride, he suddenly saw that the little lizard's front legs were off the ground and it was standing upright.

It raised its neck, bulged its eyes, and swayed its body. It walked with only its two legs at the back, and its speed was actually very fast.

This appearance did not look like a lizard but like a small version of a dinosaur\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. Seeing that his mother was calling for him, he could only leave.

He was full of doubts. He kept feeling that he had seen some animals recently. They did not seem to be from this grassland but seemed to have migrated from elsewhere.

Furthermore, some animals seemed to have changed.

The male hyena that had suddenly become stronger and smarter, the Seno brothers' pride that suddenly broke the rules of the pride during the day, and the little lizard that he had just seen, none of these seemed normal.

"Bam\!"

A crisp sound\!

Little Curly Tail's curled tail suddenly straightened and slapped his back fiercely.

The few mosquitoes instantly died.

"Right, there's also this kid\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at him with flickering eyes.

This kid's tail was surprisingly long and agile. It was like a long whip that was behind him. It could be bent and straightened at any time, and it could be raised at any time to cover his entire body other than his head.

Mei Mei also seemed to have noticed the abnormality of Little Curly Tail and had been staring at his tail.

Little Curly Tail was a little angry from her gaze. He swung his tail and slapped her face\!

Mei Mei was caught off guard and jumped up in fright. A deep wound immediately appeared on her face and she felt a burning pain.

Little Curly Tail was also shocked. He immediately froze in place and looked at her in shock.

He did not use any strength at all\!

"Bam\!"

Just as he was at a loss, Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked over and slapped him on the head.

Little Curly Tail immediately lowered his head and walked in front of Mei Mei. He rubbed her head and apologized.

Mei Mei went to Chu Xiaoye's side and rubbed against his body, as if she was saying, "Brother, continue to slap him\!"

Chu Xiaoye checked the wounds on her face. She was fine.

However, from the wound, the might of Little Curly Tail's tail could not be underestimated. It was probably more powerful than a whip.

If he trained further in the future, when he faced an enemy or hunted, he would have an additional weapon that the enemy could not guard against. This could greatly increase his chances of survival in the future.

"Roar\!"

Just as he was thinking about something, Mei Mei brought her face in front of him and asked him to lick her face.

Her brother's saliva was very powerful and could heal wounds very quickly. Her mother was seriously injured and was about to die. She survived after her brother licked her.

Furthermore, the last time she and Little Curly Tail were injured, they were licked by their brother.

Her brother was full of treasures.

Of course, other than his big smelly farts.

However, this time, her brother ignored her and slapped her away.

Chu Xiaoye left quickly with a cold expression.

There was no need to use his saliva for such a small wound.

If this little lioness could not even withstand this little wound, there was really no need to continue living.

From today onwards, he would let these two little fellows learn to be independent and strong. They could not always rely on him.

The world changed very quickly and became crueler.

Many a time, he could only rely on himself.

If he always thought of relying on others, he would become weaker and lazier. One day, he would be mercilessly eliminated by nature.

If they had the strength to become stronger, they had to work harder. They could not be lazy and continue to become stronger.

Only in this way could he survive more easily than other species.

Furthermore, the grassland and environment seemed to be changing quietly.

Many species that did not appear on the grassland started to appear.

He had to be vigilant in this situation.

If the outside world was greatly damaged, then more species would be forced to migrate here next.

At that time, their title as the kings of the grassland might be lost.

Forget about other ferocious carnivores, even some extremely venomous bugs might be able to wipe out the entire pride.

He could not be careless against those species that he had never come into contact with.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at his claws.

Although these claws were sharp like blades, he was not so arrogant that he thought he was invincible.

Some things could not be defeated by strength.

He thought of the poisonous bees.

Even though he had become very powerful now, he still had no chance of winning if he encountered that crazy swarm of poisonous bees again.

Therefore, he had to persevere and continue to become stronger.

Even if he was not invincible, he had to make himself stronger and easier to survive than other animals.

Although it was night, it was still very hot.

The pride almost passed through the entire forest, but they still did not find any prey.

Under the circumstances of extreme thirst and fatigue, the cold father could only return dejectedly with the pride.

When they passed by the orchard, Chu Xiaoye could not help but look up. He did not see the leopard and daughter pair.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail suddenly left the team and quickly climbed up a fruit tree.

There were still a few fruits left on the branch. He bit them off and threw them from the tree into the grass.

Unfortunately, the cold father and the female lions ignored them.

Even if their throats were already smoking from thirst.

Mei Mei ran into the grass and ate one. She curled her lips from the sourness, but she felt much more comfortable.

She quickly picked up another one and ran in front of Xi'er to quench her mother's thirst.

Xi'er only took a glance at her and thought that she was messing around. She ignored her.

Mei Mei was very disappointed.

Little Curly Tail also climbed down from the tree with a fruit in his mouth and handed it to Aisha.

Unfortunately, Aisha ignored him and only looked at him lovingly.

The female lions opened their mouths and were panting. They were famished and felt terrible. They only wanted to return to the camp to rest. They did not have the strength to play around with the children.

Chu Xiaoye sighed secretly when he saw this scene.

Many rules, traditions, and thoughts could not be changed in a short time.

Mei Mei came in front of him with the fruit in her mouth, wanting to let him eat it.

Chu Xiaoye disliked her saliva and pretended not to see it as he walked past her.

"Eh?"

Suddenly, he stopped and took a few steps back. He stared at the lioness cub's eyes in shock.

Her amber eyes turned light blue likeâ€¦ the eyes of a white human\!

When he looked at them carefully, the resemblance increased\!

They were a pair of extremely beautiful but strange eyes\!

In the night, they were filled with a strange sense of beauty\!
