Chapter 271: Unity of Will

No one dared to look up at him again.

The restless fire seed was extinguished by the blood before it could burn.

The death of the six lions was like a heavy hammer that smashed their hearts that were preparing to roar from the crowd. It also smashed awake their fear and respect for the strong.

They woke up with a start, lowered their heads, and crawled on the ground to express their submission.

To be able to kill all six strong lions in the blink of an eye, even the one-eyed lion king they had always followed could not do so.

Therefore, this young king was indeed qualified and strong to become their true king.

They were willing to bow down to him\!

Chu Xiaoye put away his claws and did not look at the corpses of the six lions again.

He walked in front of the one-eyed lion king and told him that this team was still led by him and his pride. They only had to listen to his orders.

He was a king, not a general.

He did not want to do everything himself and tire himself to death.

As for the team behind the pride of the cold father, he decided to hand it to Lars.

Although this big brother was relatively weak, he had always been very brave in the previous battles. Furthermore, he grew very quickly and was still worth nurturing.

However, he still needed a strong lion to assist him.

A calm and steady blue eye was naturally the best support.

After giving instructions, Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward, preparing to find a camp and build a new territory there. Then, using this as a starting point, he could start to fight the black tribe\!

There were only about a quarter of the lions and female lions that could fight in the pride.

Most were young cubs, female lions that needed to feed young cubs, and some old and weak lions without any combat strength.

Therefore, although this team seemed huge, they actually did not have much combat strength.

Once they encountered the main army of the black prides, they would immediately be utterly defeated and trample on each other.

No matter how much Chu Xiaoye wanted to win the battle, he could not let the old, weak, sick, and disabled participate in the battle to die.

Since they followed him willingly, he naturally had to protect them. He had to at least build a safe area and let the members who could not fight live in it first.

Otherwise, if they were all dead, what was the use of reclaiming their homes?

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the approaching mountain range.

The grassland at the foot of the mountain was filled with bushes and bordered with mountains. He should be able to build a good camp.

The current team, together with the pride of the cold father, had about four hundred lions. The food they needed to consume every week was not a small number.

Fortunately, it was the rainy season and the animals and plants had undergone mutations. They reproduced faster, more, and larger.

Be it the grassland or the forest, there were groups of herbivores looking for food.

Especially the water buffaloes.

Because these big fellows were too abnormal in size and there were many of them, they had almost no natural enemies now. Large numbers of calves were born every day, and the massacre of the black lions also made the pride on the grassland reduce rapidly. Therefore, the water buffaloes' team became larger and larger.

When it was day, their figures and arrogant cries were everywhere on the grassland.

This way, Chu Xiaoye's team would have food to eat.

Perhaps other herbivores and carnivores would flee in fear when they saw these water buffaloes, but they were naturally not afraid.

Chu Xiaoye decided to kill a group of water buffaloes at dawn to give everyone some confidence and stabilize the army's morale. It was also a gift after he ascended the throne.

For animals, eating was always the most important.

If they followed him and could not even fill their stomachs, he, as a king, would have reached the end.

"Roar—"

Just as they were advancing, an old lion at the back of the team suddenly let out a roar. Then, it turned around, bared its fangs, and looked at the darkness behind it.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and suddenly smelled a terrifying aura.

Densely packed dark eyes suddenly appeared in the darkness behind them and quietly approached them\!

They were a group of black lions\!

There were at least a hundred of them\!

They finally received the news and gathered a large group to chase after him.

When the pride saw this scene, they trembled in fear. They seemed to recall the scene of their families being slaughtered, their homes being trampled, and them fleeing in fear on those nights.

The courage he had gained from fighting a bloody battle seemed to instantly disintegrate in front of this group of huge black lions.

After all, most of their team were young cubs and female lions.

Should he escape or fight to the death?

However, could he escape? If he fought, what could he use to fight?

Once the two sides fought, the mother would protect the child with all her might, and the child would flee in fear. This way, all the members of the pride would be infected by the fear.

Then, they fled in all directions and were cruelly slaughtered one by one\!

Therefore, fighting and escaping seemed to have the same outcome.

The pride that had finally escaped here and gathered together after much difficulty was filled with despair and fear at this moment, as if they had given up resisting.

The small black prides they encountered along the way gave them the courage and confidence to survive again. Now that such a large group of black killers had suddenly appeared, they instantly returned to their previous fear and despair.

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly sounded in their ears like thunder\!

The young king led his pride to the back of the team. At the same time, he instructed all the lions to gather behind him.

The one-eyed lion king immediately roared at its team.

Lars and the blue eyes also roared at the pride behind them.

The lions stood forward\!

Even the elderly lions, the limping lions, and the injured lions all stood forward\!

They stood behind the young king, their eyes uneasy and trembling\!

Chu Xiaoye stood at the front and turned around to look at them, roaring angrily.

He let these lions see the female lions and young cubs behind them, this grassland, and this night\!

The lions turned around and saw the terrified and helpless gazes of hundreds of female lions and young cubs. It was the grassland where water and grass nurtured them beautifully. It was the night where they used to lie in their homes every night and watch the female lions and young cubs play.

Who killed their family?

Who had snatched his home?

Who made them wander around and become homeless?

It was the butcher in the night\!

It was the cruel black tribe\!

They were right in front of him\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar cut through the sky\!

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, the six lions, and the pride of the cold father. Like a burning sword, he pierced into the black army unstoppably and erupted with the most dazzling light\!

"Roar—"

Countless roars sounded\!

All the lions suddenly let out deafening roars and followed behind them without hesitation, charging up\!

The terrified and desperate female lions stared blankly at their heroic and tragic figures.

An old lion with a limp fell to the ground, but it immediately got up and roared as it rushed up again.

"Roar—"

All his fear suddenly turned into strength\!

The female lions bared their fangs and roared as they rushed up\!

The young cubs followed behind and let out childish and fierce roars.

For their homes and lives, they were not weak\!
