Chapter 290: Looking for Honey

"Chi—"

Little Curly Tail immediately stopped in his tracks and thought about it. That seemed to be the case.

The cold father raised his head and stuck out his chest, running back to the bushes proudly.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was teasing Nunu and Qiqi and teaching them how to play soccer.

The green fruits that Belita brought were kicked around by them. At first, the little female leopard was very angry, but she slowly joined in and played happily.

Belia always kicked the ball at Chu Xiaoye and continued to show her slender and sexy posture.

When the cold father returned with the might of victory and the king, everyone immediately quietened down and looked at him uniformly.

The cold father raised his head and strode forward, enjoying the feeling of returning in glory.

The eyes of the four female lions revealed sincere respect and praise.

Chu Xiaoye also opened his mouth rarely and performed. "You did well tonight. Very good\!"

The cold father originally wanted to look at him sideways and teach him a lesson arrogantly. However, at the thought that he still had something to ask of him, he could only lower his status and walk over, expressing his intentions with a dignified gaze.

"Save the corpses of those black lions as food?"

Chu Xiaoye's heart immediately skipped a beat as he looked at him in shock. This person's mind seemed to be spinning faster and faster.

To them, those black lions were difficult to swallow, but to those old lions that found it difficult to catch prey, they could be treated as food to survive.

If more than two hundred black lions were preserved by drying them, it would indeed be enough for them to eat for a long time.

This was definitely a very good idea\!

Chu Xiaoye was really caught off guard by his father's sudden intelligence. As for his performance tonight, let alone him, the other members would never have thought of it in their dreams.

It seemed that this father's potential was still very great.

"Roar—"

Seeing that he did not answer after a long time, the cold father thought that he was still remembering his past hatred and refused to answer. Hence, he was very angry.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly raised his claws to show that he could. However, he still needed some time and could not be anxious.

He had to go to the forest at the back to find enough honey.

Honey was a natural preservative. No matter how long it was placed for, the pure honey would not turn bad. If it was smeared on those prey, it could indeed reduce the time they rotted and give them time to dry.

There was no time to lose.

He immediately brought Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, Tilly, Molly, and the leopard sisters to the forest at the back.

Although there were many beehives in the forest, as for how much honey they could obtain, it would depend on their luck.

At the same time, he let the cold father inform Lars and One-eyed and let them bring the team to gather the corpses of the black lions on the grassland and pile them on the territory of the elderly lions.

This was a big project. Fortunately, they had enough members and should be able to complete it soon.

Tonight, the elderly lions had used their lives and courage to save the entire team. Therefore, every member of this team was obliged to help them gather food.

The cold father immediately set off to find Lars and One-eyed.

He decided not to let go of the corpses of any black lion. He wanted to make all these enemies into jerky for his old companions to eat.

Chu Xiaoye felt that there should not be enough people to find honey. Therefore, he called his mother, Xi'er, and the pit.

As for Callie and Maya, they would stay at home to take care of the two children.

In front of the territory, there were still patrolling lions. If the black lions suddenly killed their way back, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others would naturally know immediately and inform them through roars.

He could not lower his guard at any time.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team through the territory and walked towards the forest at the back.

Looking up at the majestic mountain, his heart skipped a beat. He only needed to climb over it to reach his new home on the other side with more food.

Although the competition there was also very intense, it should be much safer than here.

However, he could not abandon this team now.

Even if he could, Little Curly Tail, Lars, and the cold father, how could they bear to do so?

"Roar—"

When he brought the team through the territory at the back, many prides took the initiative to walk over. They lowered their heads and let out low roars of respect and gratitude.

Many female lions and young cubs lay on the ground and expressed their respect and gratitude for him as a king with their most sincere attitude.

He gave them a piece of land that they could survive on. At the same time, he gave them hope of survival and the hope of reclaiming their home.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the female lions and young cubs lying on the two sides of the road, as well as the mighty lions with their heads lowered. A warm current flowed through his heart and his blood surged.

At this moment, he felt the responsibility on his shoulders become even heavier.

He had to protect them, let them return to their former home, and make those bastards who destroyed their families pay the price in blood\!

The night retreated.

A red sun slowly rose.

Chu Xiaoye carried his dream and responsibility and brought the team into the forest.

Soon, they discovered a huge beehive in a bush.

The densely packed poisonous bees crawled around the beehive. They seemed to have mutated as well. They were now twice as big as before, like small sparrows, and looked terrifying.

If one was attacked crazily by such a group of poisonous bees, even a strong water buffalo would fall.

However, Chu Xiaoye had long thought of a solution.

He let everyone retreat first to more than ten meters away. Then, he walked close and curled his tail. With a puff, he spat out a dense black smoke at the beehive.

After spraying it, he immediately jumped onto a big tree beside him and quickly climbed to the top.

After a moment, when the black smoke cleared and there were no more buzzing sounds of poisonous bees flying around under the tree, he carefully climbed down.

The grass under the beehive was covered in poisonous bees. No one knew if they died from the smell or if they fainted.

There were also some poisonous bees crawling on the ground shakily, as if they were drunk.

In the holes of the beehive, many poisonous bees also crawled out in panic and fell to the ground drunkenly.

Seeing that there was no danger, Little Curly Tail and the others hurriedly walked over.

Seeing the scene of his entire family being killed, Little Curly Tail admired and respected his brother even more.

Tilly smirked. "As expected of the smelly fart king\!"

Chu Xiaoye waited for a while more. Seeing that there were no more poisonous bees crawling out of the beehive, he extended his claws and knocked down the huge beehive.

The beehive was filled with thick and fragrant honey. With their sense of smell, they naturally smelled it very clearly.

Chu Xiaoye threw the beehive to Little Curly Tail and continued to walk into the depths of the forest with the team, preparing to find the next beehive.

Not long after they left, a black mass of poisonous bees flew back. They circled above the corpses of the hornets for a while, then chased in the direction they left in.

In the deeper forest, a centipede that was thicker than an adult's arm had just crawled out of the cave when a mosquito suddenly flew over from above. Its sharp mouth instantly pierced into its body.

The huge centipede immediately curled up and struggled violently.

However, in the blink of an eye, its flesh withered and only a colorful shell was left.
