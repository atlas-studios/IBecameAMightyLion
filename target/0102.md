Chapter 102: Protecting Brother

The pain was already numb.

His claws were dripping with blood and he no longer felt anything.

However, he was still running with all his might.

The sun was roasting them like fire.

Chu Xiaoye was dizzy and had lost consciousness. His vision was also blurry.

However, his body was still running instinctively with Little Curly Tail on his back.

He staggered down the hill, ran out of the swamp, and ran across the grassland.

The arrow on its hind legs swayed.

The cub on his back swayed.

The world in front of him swayed.

Finally, when he approached the forest, he fell to the ground and could not stand up again.

He opened his mouth and panted heavily. His heavy eyelids gradually closed and he could not see anything.

He fainted.

Little Curly Tail fell from his back and crawled beside him, quietly looking at his mangled front limbs and feet.

There were no more claws.

The soil and dust, grass and flesh were all mixed together and could not be differentiated.

The sharp claws that had once terrified hyenas had already been broken from the flesh and uprooted to save him.

Little Curly Tail crawled beside his brother and silently looked at his tightly closed eyes. He had long forgotten the pain of his flesh being torn off his legs.

His brother was in more pain.

The sun was shining brightly overhead.

He leaned close to his brother's head with all his might and reached out with his front limbs, placing the still bleeding wound on his brother's mouth.

His brother must be very thirsty after running for so long with him on his back.

He raised his head again, raised his neck, and placed his head on his brother's head, helping him block the hot sun.

He slowly closed his eyes.

The brothers snuggled up to each other and crawled only dozens of meters away from the bushes, enduring the hot sun.

Time passed by slowly and was filled with torture.

"Cuckoo\!"

Vultures were circling overhead.

The two cubs crawled in the withered grass and did not move.

In the evening.

The vulture that had been circling in the sky for a long time finally landed.

It cried out from the side and turned around, but it did not dare to approach.

More vultures rushed over from afar and flew down. They cried out noisily around them as if they were testing the two motionless lions.

After a long time, the two cubs still did not move.

A vulture finally could not help but spread its wings and approach carefully from behind.

It prepared to use its sharp mouth to quickly peck and see if the two lions were really dead.

When it rolled its neck and walked close, just as it was about to open its mouth to peck, the curved lion tail suddenly swung out with a whoosh\!

"Bam\!"

Like an iron whip, it slapped its neck viciously\!

Its body suddenly leaned forward and it crawled on the ground. Its entire body twitched and it flapped its wings vigorously, but it could not stand up again.

Its neck was broken.

The other vultures that were about to approach immediately panicked. They flapped their wings and cried out as they fled in all directions.

Little Curly Tail raised his head and turned to look disdainfully at the vulture that was still struggling on the ground. He swung his tail and wrapped it around his neck, dragging it in front of him.

"Crack\!"

He bit its neck.

Blood flowed out.

He quickly brought it to his brother's mouth and aimed the bleeding wound at his brother's mouth.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The cries of hyenas suddenly came from the distant grassland.

The vultures gave them directions.

Little Curly Tail's body trembled. He raised his neck and wanted to stand up, but his two front legs were in extreme pain and he could not use any strength.

He crawled beside his brother and raised his head, looking coldly at the hyenas that were running over.

There were about ten hyenas.

Normally, he and his brother would not care at all.

But now, his brother was injured and unconscious.

And he could not stand up again.

Could it be that before their brothers could become the lion king that shocked the grassland, they would die miserably and humiliated by the sharp teeth of these despicable people?

Little Curly Tail's heart was filled with sadness.

He was unwilling, he regretted, he was terrified, and he felt guilty\!

His stubbornness and childishness had implicated his brother and harmed him.

He thought of how his brother had broken his claws when he saved him previously, but he did not even make a sound. He also endured the pain and carried him to escape. Even when he was shot, he did not stop until he carried him here.

His eyes were blurry.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

More than ten hyenas ran over excitedly and surrounded them. They opened their mouths and revealed their cold fangs.

These two cubs were clearly injured and could not stand up.

They were overjoyed to encounter such a feast in the dry season when there was a lack of food\!

Little Curly Tail's chest was hot and his body was trembling slightly. He leaned tightly against his brother and stared coldly at the hyenas beside him.

He could not let these despicable things touch his brother's body\!

Even if he had to risk his life, he had to protect his brother\!

He endured the intense pain and propped up his body with his badly mutilated legs that almost revealed his bones.

He bared his fangs and bared them. His tail was trembling like a venomous snake hiding in the dark\!

"Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas could not wait anymore, afraid that if they delayed any further, more companions or other animals would come and share this delicious meal.

They bared their fangs and pounced forward with a fierce expression\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail suddenly roared angrily and bit at a hyena in front of him\!

The hyena hurriedly stopped and turned to the side to dodge\!

Little Curly Tail was about to pounce on it when he felt a pain in his legs and fell to the ground.

The hyena saw an opportunity and immediately pounced from the side, preparing to bite his abdomen\!

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, Little Curly Tail's tail suddenly whipped up and wrapped around its neck. He suddenly pulled and pulled it to the ground, sliding it in front of him\!

"Crack\!"

Little Curly Tail bit its neck\!

The hyena opened its mouth and widened its eyes in fear and despair.

At this moment, the other hyenas also pounced forward and almost all pounced at Chu Xiaoye\!

They planned to bite this motionless cub away and eat it first. Then, they would deal with this crippled lion\!

They were already drooling\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail hurriedly put down the hyena. He endured the pain and pounced on his brother, using his body to protect him\!

A few hyenas pounced over ferociously and bit his neck and back\!

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

He endured the pain and turned his head to bite as he swung his tail and lashed the hyenas crazily\!

Right at this moment, a hyena that had its head slapped suddenly jumped up and bit his tail\!

A sharp pain suddenly assaulted him from his tail\!

Little Curly Tail trembled and roared again\!

The hyenas took this opportunity to charge forward\!
