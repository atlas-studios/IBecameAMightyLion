lowliest slaves. Their Shadow Black Lions would become the true rulers of this place\!

He was terrified and excited.

Wait\!

Just wait\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the face and sent him flying.

Before he could land, the little white lion, Tilly, rushed to where he was about to land. With a bang, she slapped him back and landed in front of Chu Xiaoye again.

"Continue shouting. I'll wait."

Chu Xiaoye looked at him coldly. The anger in his heart had already started to burn when he saw the wounds on his mother, Little Curly Tail, and the others.

If they dared to bully his family, they would have to pay the price in blood\!

He was not soft-hearted towards these invaders\!

He would kill as many as they came\!

Leave none alive\!

"Roar—"

Sed got up from the ground, his mouth full of blood. He looked at him with hatred and continued to roar.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped away one of his fangs and looked at him encouragingly. "Continue\!"

Sed shivered in pain, but did not dare to resist.

Catherine stood behind him.

The six terrifying lions stood at the side, looking at him covetously.

"Roar—"

He roared again, each louder than the last, angrier and more hateful.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him again and slapped away his other fangs.

"Roar—"

At this moment, the roar of a lion in the distant darkness suddenly came.

Then, a murderous aura filled the air\!

Sed was overjoyed. He stared hatefully at the young lion that had slapped his teeth away. Then, he grinned and looked at every member behind him with a cruel gaze.

He seemed to be saying, "Kid, I want your entire family to die\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

His entire jaw suddenly flew out\!

"Roar—"

A miserable scream suddenly cut through the night sky and rushed into the sky\!

The sudden pain made this night Killing God fall to the ground and roll violently, crying out miserably.

Chu Xiaoye raised his golden claw with blood dripping from it and did not look at him again. Instead, he looked at the distant darkness, his eyes revealing a ferocious and bloodthirsty expression.

Did his entire family die?

Good\!

Then I'll fulfill your wish\!

Behind him, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were shocked and excited to see his golden claws grow back.

"Roar—"

An angry roar\!

A super pride with more than twenty black lions and five black female lions ran over with a murderous aura\!

Those black fur were perfectly disguised in the night. One could only see those dark eyes\!

No matter where, it was definitely a terrifying thing to suddenly see a team formed by so many lions\!

On this grassland, even if there were only five lions, they could occupy a large piece of land and kill a large number of lions and female lions, causing all the lions to flee when they heard the news. Now, there were actually more than twenty lions\!

Little Nuka, who was standing at the back, fell to the ground in fear from the terrifying roar and the terrifying lion team.

Even the cold father, who was not afraid of death just now, started to tremble instinctively.

The other lionesses were terrified.

Sed, who had lost his jaw on the ground, actually stood up again and let out a hoarse and hateful roar, as if he was urging his tribe to take revenge for him and kill every lion here\!

The lion king of this black pride was a mighty lion that was comparable to the Chino brothers.

When he brought the pride close aggressively, he was shocked by the huge size of the team in front of him.

He thought that he was already big enough. Who knew that there were a few fellows who were larger and more terrifying than him here\!

However, there were a total of 25 lions behind him. All of them were strong men who had experienced hundreds of battles. In just a few days after coming to this grassland, they had already killed hundreds of lions. Why would they be afraid of these stupid big fellows?

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared and wanted to use his huge aura to suppress the other party.

The 25 lions and the five female lions behind him immediately roared with him.

However, the scene of the other party trembling in fear did not appear.

Furthermore, the two lions that were about his size actually looked at him like he was an idiot\!

What made him even more furious was that the team, which was clearly several times fewer, actually split up and stood in all directions, surrounding them\!

Was he fucking humiliating him?

They were supposed to surround them, okay?

"Roar—"

The black lion king immediately roared angrily. It could not tolerate it anymore and pounced at the young non-mainstream lion with a tuft of golden fur at the front\!

He wanted to teach this arrogant fellow a lesson he would regret forever\!

"Bang\!"

He flew out.

He was sent flying\!

Just as he pounced close, he was slapped away\!

Blood and fangs flew out in the air, just like his lost youth and dignity as a lion king.

He fell to the ground in a sorry state and stood up.

Then, he saw a scene that made him tremble with fear and regret\!

The six giant lions surrounding him were like wolves entering a herd of sheep, invincible. They rushed into his tribe and slapped them one by one, slaughtering them crazily like cutting melons and vegetables\!

As for the seemingly docile and cute lioness cub, her claws were actually silver. With one claw, she was as fast as a ghost and cut open his five wives one by one\!

Blood splashed and flesh flew everywhere\!

Broken limbs and even heads rolled everywhere\!

His super pride, his lions, and female lions were unable to resist at all. They were like weak chickens that could not withstand a single blow\!

"Roar—"

His heart was like a knife being twisted. He immediately roared angrily and prepared to pounce on her to save her.

However, the young lion with a tuft of golden fur stood in front of him and cruelly told him to calm down and watch his entire family die\!

The golden flickering claw pressed on his head and pressed him to the ground. No matter how he struggled, he could not stand up\!

All the strength in his body seemed to have suddenly disappeared at this moment.

He twisted his body with all his might, wanting to stand up and escape the control of this golden claw, but it was useless.

Hence, he could only lie on the ground and watch helplessly as his pride fell one by one, blood spraying out, and they howled in despair. In the end, all of them died\!

In the blink of an eye, his entire pride fell into a pool of blood. No one could stand up again.

As for the known as the Killing God of the Night, no one touched him at all. At this moment, he widened his eyes and lay on the ground, completely dead.

Looking at his ferocious and distorted appearance and his eyes that were almost bulging out of their sockets, he was clearly frightened to death\!

The black lion king's body trembled and its urine flowed.

The golden claw that was pressing on his head finally let go.

"Roar…"

He hurriedly started to beg, indicating that he was willing to submit.

The hatred of having his entire family killed seemed to be completely forgotten at this moment of life and death.

The dignity of the lion king had also been trampled into the soil and buried in the dirty mud.

He wanted to live\!

Only by living could he see their shadow race conquer this land, kill the pride here, and cover the world here\! Only by living could he have hope to take revenge\!

He wanted to bear the humiliation\!

He wanted to survive\!

He had to survive and see these enemies die with his own eyes\!

"Bang\!"

Just as he was begging for mercy and scheming for his future revenge, the raised golden claw suddenly slapped down heavily again\!

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

His entire skull suddenly shattered and collapsed\!

Blood flowed out of his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears\!

His vision was first scarlet red, then gradually turned black, and then darkness\!

He fell to the ground weakly and died\!

They came and left in a hurry.

This super pride gathered together and died together, not leaving a single one behind.

Chu Xiaoye would not cruelly break them up.

He put away his claws and looked at the corpse on the ground. The bloodthirst in his eyes gradually receded, but the doubts in his heart increased.

Blood dyed the grass and the night sky red.

The strong smell of blood filled the air and drifted far away with the night wind, stimulating the noses of many animals.

This was a group of extraordinary black-haired lions. Clearly, they came from another grassland.

If it was not just this group, the problem would be serious.

They had traveled a long distance and migrated here. Their environment had either been terrifyingly damaged or they had encountered something terrifying that forced them to leave their home.

Of course.

These had nothing to do with him.

Even if they all migrated to this grassland and killed the pride here, what did it have to do with him?

He had returned this time to leave this place with every member of the pride of the cold father and head to the other side of the mountain to build a better home.

He would not interfere in other matters.

"Roar—"

The injured cold father growled and looked at him fearfully. Then, he raised his head and looked elsewhere coldly, as if he was saying, "Unfilial son, you finally know to return? You did well this time. I won't pursue the crime of you running away from home\!"

Then, he glanced at the circle of golden fur on his son's neck and snorted coldly, as if he was very dissatisfied with this kid's non-mainstream method of dyeing his fur.

Look at this hooligan's appearance. He could not compare to my mighty and domineering image\!

At this moment, Catherine looked over.

The cold father's stomach trembled. He hurriedly limped behind Aisha and pretended to lick the wounds on her body, his eyes filled with gentleness.

He did not believe that this female cub would dare to be impudent to that kid's mother\!

Aisha looked over.

Catherine immediately lowered her head.

See, this female cub dared to be arrogant outside and was very obedient at home\!

The cold father was pleased with himself and deliberately glared at her with a strong aura to show that he was not afraid at all.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of Xi'er and saw that she was seriously injured. Just as he was about to heal her, he suddenly felt a chill behind his butt\!

He was shocked and subconsciously raised his head to retreat, kicking fiercely\!

"Bang\!"

Mei Mei was kicked to the ground. She raised her head with tears in her eyes.

However, the female cub was still roaring excitedly.

She finally licked her brother\!

She finally licked it\!

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail also ran over excitedly. He was so excited that he forgot the pain on his tail. He opened his mouth and twisted his body until it almost folded. He stuck out his tongue and started to lick Chu Xiaoye everywhere.

He prepared to lick his brother all over\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly kicked him away and roared angrily.

With so many subordinates watching, you smelly brother, are you preparing to destroy the prestige and image your brother had painstakingly built up?

Little Curly Tail lay on the ground with tears in his eyes, looking at his brother in grievance.

Mei Mei had already licked him\!

Indeed, his brother loved Mei Mei more than him\!

Jealousy made his eyes red, jealousy made him angry, and jealousy made his tail burn\!

Suddenly, his broken tail that fell to the ground suddenly bent and instantly healed with a crisp crack\!

He was stunned for a moment. He stood up and tried to swing his tail. He actually did not feel any pain anymore. Instead, he became even more agile\!

"Brother is indeed impressive\!"

Little Curly Tail looked at his brother with even more passion and admiration. He wished he could extend his tongue again and lick his brother's entire body with all his might. He was willing to be kicked to death\!

The moment his brother returned, his broken tail healed\!

He had just licked his brother's fur and his brother actually injected strength into his body from his tongue and healed his tail\!

His brother was really terrifying\!

Chu Xiaoye checked the wounds on their bodies carefully. Although they were also very serious, the recovery ability of these two little fellows was much stronger than that of the other members of the pride. Previously, they did not even seem to be able to stand steadily, now they were clearly already able to jump around.

Therefore, he decided to treat the other members first.

In the past, Xi'er was the first member of the pride to be lucky enough to receive his saliva treatment. She knew how powerful he was, so she immediately took the initiative to show her wound and let him lick it.

Chu Xiaoye licked a few times and felt a little embarrassed when he saw that everyone was looking at him with burning eyes. He immediately growled and let mixed fur and the others drag the corpses on the ground further away. At the same time, they could patrol the vicinity to see if there were other invaders.

There was definitely no way to migrate tonight. They could only set off after every member of the pride recovered.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the bushes over there and called for everyone to go over.

The members of the pride of the cold father were injured and walking was extremely difficult and painful.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and followed behind. He looked at their wounds with lingering fear.

Fortunately, he had returned just in time tonight. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

No matter what, he could not abandon them again.

Tilly was surprisingly quiet as she followed behind him with Catherine.

The little white lion did not participate in the battle just now. It behaved like a gentle and quiet little girl and looked noble and beautiful. Even Mei Mei could not help but peep.

When everyone walked towards the bushes, Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that there was still a figure standing in place in a daze with its head lowered. Its eyes were filled with loneliness and it did not follow him.

That was his brother, Lars.

After he was cruelly chased out of the pride by the cold father, he swore in his heart that he had to make a name for himself and hold his head high. At that time, he would bring the pride and return gloriously, making every member of the pride of the cold father afraid and regret.

Now, when he returned, no one recognized him.

His thin body, messy and dirty fur, and lonely and weak figure were so inconspicuous, like a speck of dust in the corner that they ignored.

Standing under the dazzling light and being welcomed and respected by all the members was his younger brother, who he had always been targeting.

This difference made him depressed, desperate, and ashamed.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and looked at him encouragingly, as if he was saying, "Brother, come over. No one will chase you away again."

The other members of the pride of the cold father also stopped and looked over in confusion.

The cold father's body suddenly trembled as he looked at the thin and sorry figure in shock.

He subconsciously opened his mouth and bared his fangs. He roared angrily and prepared to rush over to chase her away, but he was immediately withered by Catherine's cold gaze.

Under normal circumstances, lions that were chased out of the pride would never be allowed to return. Once they returned, they would be collectively attacked by the pride and might even be killed.

Lars stood there in a daze and raised his head, looking sadly at his pride and family. They were so close, but it was as if they were separated by the horizon.

He stood outside the border and in the territory of the Nuka lions. He did not dare to take another step, but he was unwilling to leave.

To this pride, he was already useless.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly walked out of the team and walked towards him. He let out a familiar voice that he had called out to him when he was young.

"Big Brother, come back. No matter what, you will always be my big brother\! Every member of the pride has his uses. In the future, you will pee in our territory with Father. I believe that your bladder is definitely enough for this job\!"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

"Roar\!"

Mei Mei also called out and looked at him encouragingly, welcoming him back.

Aisha and Xi'er immediately made a welcoming gesture.

Callie and Maya looked at him gently, expressing their friendliness.

The cold father glanced at Catherine, who was behind him, and turned around angrily. He limped towards the bushes and acquiesced to his return.

Lars trembled and his vision blurred.

He slowly raised his feet, crossed the border, and walked into his home. The tears in his eyes could not stop flowing.

Finally, he returned to this familiar land.

When he left home, it was withered and lifeless. When he returned, his eyes were filled with green and life.

Would his lion life be like this grassland, full of life again?

The night finally retreated.

A ray of light appeared on the distant horizon.

Tomorrow would definitely be better.
