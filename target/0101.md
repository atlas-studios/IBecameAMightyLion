Chapter 101: Brother

"Baa…"

Not far away, the cries of lambs could be heard.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly fell and landed on the ground, narrowly avoiding the few sharp arrows that were shot over\!

Looking at the sharp blades in the hands of the few humans, he suddenly turned around and rushed towards the distant herd of cows and sheep\!

They were a group of Maasai\!

They were the nomadic tribes of the African grassland and worked with animals on the grassland all year round.

The animals they killed the most were lions.

It was said that every Maasai had to hunt and kill an adult lion alone to be considered an adult.

They were the bane of lions\!

Be it the arrows in their hands or the sharp blades in their hands, they were a fatal threat to Chu Xiaoye\!

No matter how fast he was or how sharp his claws were, as long as he dared to pounce on it, his stomach would be cut open\!

The Maasai naturally appeared here to herd.

Their tribes had a strict hierarchy and most relied on these cows and sheep to survive.

If they came out to herd and lost their cows and sheep, the consequences would be very serious.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye's goal was that herd of cows and sheep\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and flew towards the group of docile cows and sheep like an arrow\!

The herd of cows and sheep were immediately in chaos and fled in all directions\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped and pounced on a ram. He swung his right claw fiercely and cut its stomach open\!

The Maasai were shocked and furious. They hurriedly held their bows and shouted as they ran over\!

Chu Xiaoye ran as if he was flying again and pounced at another sheep\!

After he killed the second sheep, the four Maasai had already roared and chased over\!

The bowstring vibrated and an arrow flew over\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly rolled forward and dodged it. Then, he quickly jumped up and chased after the other sheep\!

He deliberately chased these few sheep towards the distant hill\!

The four Marseilles cried out repeatedly as they brandished their sharp blades and chased after him with all their might\!

Chu Xiaoye looked back. Little Curly Tail was still crawling in place and did not take the opportunity to escape.

His heart sank and he immediately accelerated, letting out a fierce lion roar\!

The few sheep panicked and ran up the hill with all their might\!

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye quickly caught up to them and suddenly grabbed the stomach of a ram\!

He did not stop at all. In one go, he passed them and climbed over the hill.

When the Maasai could not see him, he immediately ran down the hill and to the right. He circled around the hill and suddenly turned back\!

The ram whose stomach he had grabbed fell onto the hill and let out painful cries.

After the four Maasai ran close, they looked at it and ran up the hill. Looking down, they did not see any trace of the killer.

This ram clearly could not survive.

However, they had to bring it back.

There were also other cows and sheep that ran away in panic. They had to find them back\!

They immediately shouted and split up.

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to quickly run towards the trapped Little Curly Tail\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail's legs were clamped by an extremely large animal trap. They were dripping with blood and the pain was unbearable. He could not move at all.

He looked at the distant hill and the four upright animals on the hill, his heart filled with fear and anxiety.

He only hoped that his brother could escape and not be caught by those terrifying animals.

Those animals looked thin, had no claws or sharp teeth, but the things on them were terrifying.

He regretted it very much.

He crawled on the ground, trembling in pain and despair.

Suddenly\!

He seemed to have sensed something and raised his head to look at the col on the side\!

A familiar figure suddenly appeared\!

He opened his mouth and ran as if he was flying, running towards them\!

That was his brother\!

"Brother…"

Little Curly Tail's body was trembling and his vision was blurry.

Chu Xiaoye was panting and dizzy. He felt like the sun above him was burning him. It was so hot that his entire body was in pain and his throat was smoking\!

However, he was still very fast\!

He could not stop at all\!

When he was about to run in front of Little Curly Tail, the distant Maasai suddenly discovered him. He immediately shouted and ran over\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped in front of Little Curly Tail. He looked down and saw a huge beast trap clamping tightly onto Little Curly Tail's two front limbs. The two rows of sharp teeth were like the sharp teeth of a crocodile and almost pierced through Little Curly Tail's bones\!

No wonder he was crawling here and could not move\!

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail cried out at him with a trembling voice, his eyes filled with fear and pain.

The four Maasai gathered again and ran over while shouting\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to delay. He hurriedly used his two claws to support the two sides of the trap and tried his best to break it open\!

However, because his claws did not have a place to exert force on, the trap did not move\!

He panicked\!

The four Maasai nocked their bows and ran over quickly\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at Little Curly Tail's bloody legs and then at his painful and terrified eyes. His blood immediately surged\!

He breathed heavily and his gaze was determined. He suddenly extended his two front limbs and flicked out the two golden claws. He followed Little Curly Tail's flesh that was clamped and pierced into the trap fiercely\!

His sharp claws grabbed Little Curly Tail's flesh and also the two rows of sharp fangs between the claws\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily, his face ferocious. His muscles were tense as he used all his strength to move to the side\!

His body was trembling violently\!

"Crack\!"

There were a few crisp sounds as if something was breaking\!

Little Curly Tail let out a miserable scream\!

The huge trap finally opened slowly\!

Little Curly Tail hurriedly took out his two badly mutilated forelimbs.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye let go of the animal trap and immediately turned around. He crawled in front of Little Curly Tail and roared at him\!

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment. He hurriedly endured the pain and climbed onto his back.

Chu Xiaoye immediately got up and fled in panic\!

His mouth was open and he was panting. His limbs were limp and his vision was blurry. He almost fainted.

The four Maasai had already caught up to them. The arrows nocked in their bows shot out with a whoosh\!

An arrow hit his hind leg\!

He still did not stop and ran away quickly\!

Soon, he climbed up the hill and crossed it\!

The four Maasai stopped in place and looked at his back in shock, seemingly in disbelief.

Suddenly, a Maasai lowered his head and pointed at the animal trap.

The other Maasai immediately looked down.

In the sharp teeth of the hunting beast, there were two rows of golden claws\!

At the end of those sharp claws, there were actually pieces of fresh and bloody flesh. They seemed to have been broken from the flesh and pulled out by the roots\!

The four Maasai were stunned.
