Chapter 467: New Skill

"Chi—"

Golden light flashed and blood sprayed\!

Half of the saber-toothed tiger's face fell.

However, this ancient ferocious beast's life force was extremely tenacious. The intense pain did not make it lose its mind.

It almost did not hesitate and immediately turned around. It endured the pain and fled in panic.

At the same time, his thick, long, and hard tail suddenly swung back fiercely like an iron whip and slapped Chu Xiaoye hard\!

Chu Xiaoye flew out and the sound of his ribs breaking could be heard.

He fell heavily to the ground. Just as he jumped up, he was dizzy and felt a bone-chilling pain from his body. His body swayed and he fell to the ground again.

Heat surged in his body and his blood boiled.

A trace of coolness came from the broken bones and resolved the pain.

When he stood up again, the ancient ferocious beast had long fled and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and chased out of the cave at the bottom of the tree. He jumped onto a big tree and looked at the empty bushes and the distant grassland around him. He suddenly let out a deafening roar.

Catherine and Alisa rushed back.

Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others also rushed back.

However, it was already too late.

This sneak attack made their pride suffer heavy casualties.

The Chino brothers, the sisters, and the three female lions died tragically on the spot.

Mei Mei and Molly were seriously injured. Their ribs were broken and they were unconscious.

The big black bear's face was covered in blood as it lay on the ground, on the verge of death.

The remaining female lions and the two young cubs snuggled together and shivered.

In front of that ancient ferocious beast, they could not withstand a single blow.

Grief and fear spread in the cave at the bottom of the tree.

Even Blue Eyes and the others, who had not seen the ancient beast, were terrified.

Recently, they seemed to have been too smooth. Along the way, they came to this grassland and almost did not waste too much energy to have such a large territory.

They seemed to have forgotten how cruel and terrifying nature was. They seemed to have forgotten their fear of death and their vigilance and respect for their enemies.

They were very strong and smart, but they were really nothing here.

Little Curly Tail walked to his mother's side and rubbed her head gently, his eyes filled with comfort.

Xi'er stood in front of Mei Mei, lowered her head, and called out softly, her eyes filled with tears.

The enemy was too fast and too strong. They did not react at all and did not have the courage and strength to resist.

Chu Xiaoye walked back from outside and met the gazes of all the members. Then, he quietly walked to Mei Mei and Molly's side, lowered his head, and helped them lick the wounds on their bodies.

The enemy had fled, but they could not escape.

He would bring its head back and bury these dead companions\!

The male leopard, Blue, walked in from outside and looked at the situation here with an apologetic gaze.

The leopard family of four, the cute violent bear mother and son, were not used to living in the underground cave here. The bushes were their home.

The enemy came and left quickly and quietly. They did not have the time to react.

Even if they encountered it, they would be helpless.

Chu Xiaoye did not blame them.

The strength of the saber-toothed tiger was definitely not something any member here could resist. The more that came, the more they would die.

The Belita sisters also walked in, feeling sad for the dead members and everything that happened here.

This unnecessary emotion should not have been there. It was already rare and precious.

"King, save me…"

The little girl was still pressed down by the unconscious big black bear. She struggled for a long time but could not climb out.

If she had not ridden on the big black bear and let it stop the saber-toothed tiger for a while, more members of the pride would have been killed.

Chu Xiaoye walked to her side and stuck his claws under the big black bear. He dragged the big black bear's body with all his might and let her climb out.

The little girl sat on the ground, panting. Her blue eyes trembled as she looked at him and said with lingering fear, "That tiger was really big."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the big black bear on the ground. Half of its face had almost collapsed. Clearly, it had just been slapped in the face by the saber-toothed tiger. If it were any other member, they would have long died on the spot like the Chino brothers.

"Tibbs is only temporarily unconscious. He won't die."

The little girl seemed to have seen his worry and immediately said with certainty.

She seemed to know everything about this big black bear and was very confident.

With such a serious injury, even if he did not die for the time being, it would be difficult for him to eat. He would probably die in pain in a few days.

"It's okay. The bones in Tibbs' face are just broken. He'll be fine after sleeping."

The little girl was still very certain.

"It's just that… the bones in his face are broken. He'll be fine after sleep… sleeping?"

Chu Xiaoye's eyelids twitched and he looked at her in disbelief.

However, he was not in the mood to investigate anything. There were many things he needed to do.

The warthog crawled out of the cave with its two companions trembling. Under his orders, they went to the bushes outside to dig.

Their dead companions naturally had to be buried and laid to rest. They could not let their corpses be eaten by other beasts.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others went out to patrol to prevent the enemy from returning.

The cold father looked at the corpses of the Chino brothers with a lonely gaze. From today onwards, he would be the only one to mark the territory. He started to feel a lack of interest in this glorious mission and was uneasy.

The strength of the enemy exceeded their expectations.

Chu Xiaoye ordered Little Curly Tail and the other members to guard the camp and take care of the injured.

He left alone and walked into the dense bushes, preparing to test his mutated claws again.

If the claw glint could shoot out like a sword glint, he would be able to cut open the other party's flesh without touching their body. He would be able to kill the other party without approaching. That skill was what he wanted the most.

After passing through the dense bushes, he stopped in a forest full of thorns.

"Whoosh\!"

He flicked his claws, closed his eyes, and tried to repeat his previous feeling.

The strange heat in his body surged towards his claws like a tide, as if a hot stream was about to break through the obstruction and rush out from the sharp tip of his claws\!

The tip of his claws started to burn\!

He suddenly opened his eyes and clearly saw the light shining like a star on the tip of his claw\!

He really had this skill\!

"Whoosh\!"

He aimed at the tree in front of him and swung his claws\!

The light from the claws was like a meteor that cut through the night sky, dragging out beautiful arcs in the air.

A soft sound suddenly came from behind.

Alisa secretly followed.
