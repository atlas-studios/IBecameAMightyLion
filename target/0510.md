Chapter 510: The Arrow Can't Be Blocked\!

On the third day.

Before dawn, the wooden bridge built by the orcs was only 100 meters away from the cliff here.

A group of strong orcs started to roar at the bridge, telling the elves to surrender quickly.

When they saw the elf girl at the edge of the cliff, they immediately took off their pants and revealed what was below. They laughed out loud and humiliated her while shaking their butts.

They seemed to want to use this method to make the remaining thousand plus elves terrified and desperate, and even give up resisting.

They had exhausted all their efforts to attack this place not for the corpses, but for the elven girl.

Therefore, it was naturally best if he could scare the other party and make them lose without a fight.

"Poor elves, quickly raise your hands and surrender\! As long as you take the initiative to kneel on the ground and accept our strong bodies, we can show mercy and let you live well and become our slaves\! Otherwise, we will make you wish you were dead\! We will turn your Elf City into ashes\!"

The orc laughed and twisted its body even more unrestrainedly.

The Elven Queen, Lanisi, had red hair fluttering and was wearing red armor. She stood valiantly at the edge of the cliff, as dazzling as flames and as moving as the moon. She did not show any emotions to the orcs' humiliation and provocation.

Vilis, who was standing behind her, had a cold expression and tightly held the sword on her shoulder.

She turned around and looked at the young elf hiding behind the rock not far away. She could not help but say, "Aren't you going to attack?"

Chu Xiaoye hid behind the rock and looked at the orc roaring wantonly on the bridge. He still did not move and ignored her.

On both sides of the cliff, all the archers were hiding behind the rocks, waiting for his orders.

Behind him, other than Catherine, who was always by his side, there was also an elf girl carrying a light blue jade bow.

Chu Xiaoye was a little puzzled. From yesterday onwards, this arrow girl had been following behind him like his bodyguard. She was inseparable. She asked her questions and did not answer, as if she had become the mute from before.

Wasn't she the Queen's personal guard?

What made him want to complain the most was that he was squatting behind the rock, afraid that the orc's bow would shoot over. However, the elven girl behind him was standing elegantly behind him, not having any intention of hiding.

She was tall, had a proud figure, and was charming. Standing like this, she was seen by the orcs on the bridge.

Hence, the attention of a few orcs was attracted and they started to roar and twist even more loudly and excitedly.

Chu Xiaoye blushed and his heart skipped a beat when he heard this. He could not help but turn around and say, "Denise, I know that you're voluptuous and your figure is explosive, but can you squat down? You're tempting me like this and it'll affect my performance, okay?" 

The elf girl blushed and finally squatted down, but she still revealed her head.

The orc roared anxiously, as if they were furious that they could not see her figure and started cursing.

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and stared at the elf girl's perfect face in front of him. Only when her cheeks were red and her eyes dodged did he say, "Can you lower your head?"

Denise was stunned for a moment before she lowered her head.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the orcs outside and said, "Those orcs are all strong. There's definitely no lack of sharpshooters among them, and their bows can definitely shoot over at this distance. Although you might not have used bows to increase your morale in your previous battle, you have to be careful. Wouldn't it be very wrong if you were suddenly shot?"

Denise looked at the distance between here and the bridge.

Indeed, at this distance, he could easily shoot the arrow over and penetrate the other party's neck.

If she could, it meant that the other party could too.

She looked at the queen standing at the edge of the cliff.

Chu Xiaoye immediately knew what she was thinking and said, "It's okay. The queen is safer than you. The orcs would never be willing to kill the elven queen standing at the most striking place."

At this moment, Vilis, who was standing behind Lanisi, could not help but remind him, "It's 120 meters\!"

The orcs built very quickly. More orcs stepped onto the bridge and started to roar for the elves to surrender.

Chu Xiaoye stared at the orcs working at the bridge and still did not move.

Denise could not help but say, "The distance is enough."

She meant that at this distance, not only could her arrows reach, other Elven archers could also reach them.

Chu Xiaoye said, "Wait a while more."

Soon, the sun set and night fell.

Torches lit up on the bridge, like a long dragon extending from the opposite side of the cliff.

The night wind blew and the swaying flames clearly illuminated the ferocious and ferocious faces of the orcs.

"A hundred meters."

Denise reminded him.

Chu Xiaoye still stared outside and did not move.

At this moment, even Queen Lanisi started to panic.

If they did not release the arrows now, when the orc bridge was closer, the strong orcs could sprint and jump over. At that time, when the battle was chaotic, the elven archers would be useless.

Only Princess Annie looked calmly in front of her and was not in a hurry.

When the orc bridge was only 50 meters away from the cliff here, Chu Xiaoye heard the slightly heavier panting of the elf girl behind him.

She started to be nervous.

Archers who attacked from afar were most afraid of the enemy approaching, let alone so many strong and terrifying orcs.

If anything went wrong, all of them and the entire fairy race would be doomed.

Vilis had already pulled out the sword on her shoulder and was prepared to charge forward at any time.

Chu Xiaoye stared at the orcs on the bridge, his eyes flickering with a golden light. Through the dark night, he was estimating the number of orcs on the bridge.

Soon, the entire bridge was filled with orcs.

They roared excitedly and prepared to jump. When the time came, they would surge to the other side like a tide. The thousand-plus little elves would not be enough for them to see.

"Shoot\!"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye ordered.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he finished speaking, the elf girl behind him had already shot the arrow.

The sharp arrow that shot out pierced through the eye of an orc at the front who was building a bridge\!

The orc let out a scream. His body swayed and he fell into the bottomless abyss from the bridge.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

When Denise's arrow shot out, the arrows of the other elven archers also shot out.

Immediately, arrows flew everywhere\!

Due to the close distance, the orcs all lit torches with clear targets. Before the seven orcs who were building the bridge in front of them could react, they were shot to the ground.

Some fell on the bridge, and some fell into the bottomless abyss.

The orcs standing in front roared and started to retreat, but there were too many orcs following behind. They rubbed shoulders and stood all over the bridge, unable to retreat for a moment.

Under the lead of the sharpshooter, Denise, the elves' arrows rained down on the orcs on the bridge.

Every arrow of Denise's would hit the orcs in the eyes and pierce into their heads. The orcs died almost instantly.

The orcs at the back reacted and held their shields, wanting to go forward to block the arrows fired by the elves. However, the bridge was full of orcs, and they could not squeeze over.

Soon, the orcs within 200 meters were all killed by the arrows and fell on the bridge. As for the torches in their hands, some fell into the abyss and some fell on the bridge. They lit their clothes and corpses and started to roast the bridge that was still full of water.

The orcs standing 200 meters away were also terrified. They turned around and surged towards the cliff in panic.

The entire orc army was in chaos.

The newly built bridge started to sway and creak.

Denise's arrow finally stopped.

The other elven archers looked excitedly at the corpses all over the bridge. They probably did not expect to kill so many orcs so easily and the other party could not resist at all.

The battle between the elves and the orcs had always been a chaotic battle of blades. Victory and defeat would be determined by courage, ferocity, strength, and skills. Never had there been a battle that started before the two armies could even come into contact.

Tonight, they had completely opened their eyes\!

Queen Lanisi was still standing at the edge of the cliff. Her red hair fluttered as she looked at the bridge motionless. Her hand, which was holding the sword hilt, let out the sounds of bones creaking, as if she wanted to crush the sword hilt.

She was more excited than anyone.

This was her first battle since becoming a queen.

Vilis stood behind her, the sword in her hand trembling.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's words were heard. "Lady Vilis, there are already 250 orcs."

According to their bet, there were still 50 orcs left.

Vilis clenched her fists and suddenly turned around. "I've counted seriously just now. There are only 80, at most 100\! Don't you dare lie to me\!"

Look, look\! This was the Great Swordmaster of the elves, a noble and honorable knight. Could he be any more shameless?

Vilis blushed and ignored him.

Chu Xiaoye did not stoop to her level and said, "Alright, I'll count you as eighty."

At this moment, the orcs on the bridge finally retreated. The orcs with shields protected the orcs who built the bridge and stepped onto the bridge again. As they extinguished the flames, they arched their bodies and advanced carefully.

Chu Xiaoye said to Denise, who was behind him, "Prepare the crossbow\!"

Denise immediately stood up and raised her hand.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, an arrow suddenly flew out from the bridge and shot towards her.

Denise turned her wrist and clamped the tip of the arrow with her long fingers.

At the same time, Chu Xiaoye turned around and pounced over. He hugged her slender and tight legs and pushed her to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye's reaction was not slower than hers. However, as an archer, not only could she hear the sound of an arrow breaking through the air, she could also sense it in advance and subconsciously reacted.

"There are archers among the orcs\!"

Chu Xiaoye lay on her and turned to shout at the queen at the cliff.

The Queen stood there. Previously, she had wanted to attract the attention of the orcs and make the elven archers suddenly shoot. Now, she had to retreat\!

Vilis and Annie immediately protected the Queen and retreated. They came to Chu Xiaoye's side and hid behind the stone together.

When they saw Chu Xiaoye and Denise's current situation, they were stunned.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly got up from Denise and explained without blushing, "I was using my height to measure how long Denise's legs were. They're indeed very long. It should be good for escaping later."

Denise also sat up and looked at the arrow between her fingers with a grave expression.

There were also good archers in the orc army.

The four ballistae were already prepared. The thick and long iron arrows had already been twisted by the winch and were tightly fastened to the bowstring, waiting solemnly.

When the orc vanguard raised their shields and came to the front of the bridge to protect the orc craftsmen from repairing the bridge, the archers in the orc army also climbed onto the bridge, preparing to rush up and counterattack at any time.

This time, they were smart. They did not squeeze anyone or light any torches. Instead, they left a path in the middle of the bridge so that the archers could walk to the front.

The materials to repair the bridge were sent endlessly to the front.

The orcs with shields surrounded the orc craftsmen tightly.

Chu Xiaoye stared at the orcs on the bridge with a burning gaze and said to Vilis, who was beside him, "Lady Vilis, count again. How many orcs are there on the bridge?"

Vilis did not say anything and pretended not to hear.

Queen Lanisi smiled and said, "I roughly counted. There are at least four hundred people within two hundred meters."

"Alright\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and said to the elf soldier behind the four ballistae, "Release the arrows\!"

"Whoosh\!"

The first arrow flew out and shot out with an ear-piercing whistle and an unstoppable sharp aura\!

"Bang\!"

The sharp and heavy arrow pierced through the hard shield and knocked the row of orc soldiers standing at the front to the ground. One of the orc soldiers was pierced through and flew back, sending the few orc craftsmen flying and hitting the soldiers following behind heavily\!

In the blink of an eye, dozens of orc were broken by the impact and could not get up.

As for the orc craftsmen and the orc soldier whose body was pierced, they were strung together by the iron arrow and died instantly\!

This terrifying arrow not only frightened the orcs on the bridge, but also the elves on this side.

Chu Xiaoye clearly heard the huge sword loli beside him and took a deep breath.

"Continue shooting\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately said.

"Whoosh\!"

Another iron arrow flew out\!

Before the orcs could react, they were strung up again and flew out\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The four ballistae started to release arrows one after another.

The orcs standing at the front of the bridge did not have the time to dodge or escape. They were strung together or their bones shattered from the collision and they flew everywhere.

The orc archers standing at the back could not reach them at all. When they held their bows and wanted to rush to the front to counterattack, they realized that they could not advance at all. Just as they took a few steps forward, they were sent flying by the impact.

Not only was the iron sword on the crossbow terrifying in penetration, but its range was also astonishing. The orc archers could only take a beating and escape. They could not shoot the arrows in their hands.

"Climb down\! Climb down\!"

At this moment, an orc general shouted angrily.

The orcs that were lucky enough to not fall in front of the bridge immediately woke up and hurriedly crawled on the ground, wanting to dodge the attack of the iron arrows.

Chu Xiaoye raised his hand and made the crossbow stop for the time being. Then, he said to Denise, who was behind him, "Let the archers shoot at a 45-degree angle at the sky. The range is further and covers all the space on the bridge within 200 meters. Let none of the orcs live within 200 meters of the bridge\!"

Denise was stunned for a moment before she immediately understood. She raised her hand and gestured for the archers to wait for orders. Then, she personally demonstrated with her bow.

"Whoosh\!"

When Denise's arrow flew into the sky, the arrows of the other elven archers also flew out. Then, like a dense rain, they covered all the space 200 meters in front of the bridge\!

The orcs who were lying on the bridge or hiding or were injured and not dead immediately let out miserable cries.

More heavy breathing sounded beside and behind Chu Xiaoye.

When he said, "cover all the space on the bridge within 200 meters and make sure that there are no living orcs within 200 meters of the bridge." Queen Lanisi and Princess Annie looked at him.

Lanisi eyes even revealed a hint of fear.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The elf archer's arrows covered all the space within 200 meters of the bridge again and again.

The orcs on the bridge no longer made any sounds.

The Orc archers standing 200 meters away had already fled in fear.

Before the two armies could come into contact, they had already lost nearly 700 soldiers, and the other party was not injured at all. Such a blow instantly shocked and dejected the members of the entire orc army.

The Orc army that had been aggressive and clamoring endlessly previously was no longer imposing at this moment.

"Lady Vilis, this should be enough for 300, right?"

Behind the rock, Chu Xiaoye turned his head and looked at the silver-haired elf behind the Queen. The corner of his mouth revealed a victorious smile.

Vilis looked blankly at the bridge that had fallen into a dead silence. The sword in her hand was trembling slightly, as if it was her current mood.

She was not trembling because she had lost the bet, but because the outcome and process of this battle had completely overturned her previous combat thoughts, making her suddenly feel how stupid and ignorant she had been in the past and even now.

No wonder the elves had declined and almost died.

Of course, like her, everyone in the elves was shocked.

At this moment, no one would doubt this bald lion or the short elf youth anymore.

"Iâ¦ I counted carefully. There are only 150 of them. At most, 150 is one."

The giant sword elf started to play dirty again. This time, she did not blush at all.

It seemed that once he was used to being shameless, he would no longer have any face.

"Hehe."

Chu Xiaoye chuckled and let her say again, "Alright, 150\. Nextâ¦"

He raised his head and looked at the ice bridge that was standing in midair by the cliff.

Everyone around him, including the Queen and all the elven soldiers around her, held their breaths and looked at him quietly.

At this moment, every word and every action of his would be an unquestionable order\!

"pee first."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly got up and prepared to pee.

But suddenly, everyone stood up uniformly\!

Even Princess Annie, who had always maintained her rationality and intelligence, immediately stood up subconsciously. Then, she looked at him in confusion, as if she could not understand what "peeing first" was.
