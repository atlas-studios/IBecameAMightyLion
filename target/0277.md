Chapter 277: Mastery of the Divine Technique\!

 "Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately swam towards the water with the cold father on his back\!

Seeing that the giant crocodiles were swaying and quickly surrounding him, the cold father finally woke up. He hurriedly moved his limbs and swam up with all his might.

However, how could their speed compare to the speed of those water killers?

Soon, the few giant crocodiles swam close. They opened their bloody mouths and bit ferociously at the lion and son pair\!

Just as the cold father was in fear and despair, a super airflow suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye's butt\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye carried his cold father and instantly broke through the huge crocodile's encirclement like a rocket. He shot to the water and flew up high\!

The members of the cold father's pride, who were extremely anxious on the shore, raised their heads and widened their eyes when they saw this scene, looking dumbfounded.

Chu Xiaoye could not grasp the direction in midair. He could only slowly put away the black smoke behind his butt and start to land with the cold father.

Just as he was about to fall into the river, he immediately roared at Little Curly Tail on the shore. Then, he suddenly used his strength and threw the cold father horizontally.

Little Curly Tail instantly reacted and twisted his body. The tail behind him flew over with a whoosh and wrapped around the cold father's neck, pulling him ashore.

"Whoosh\!"

As for Chu Xiaoye, he fell into the water and sank.

Mei Mei roared anxiously on the shore and told Little Curly Tail to quickly extend his tail into the water to roll his brother back.

Little Curly Tail immediately let go of the cold father and stuck his tail into the water, but he could not touch his brother's body. He immediately cried out anxiously.

Right at this moment, a huge crocodile suddenly jumped out from the water and bit his tail.

Little Curly Tail was furious. He suddenly straightened his tail and his fur stood on end like sharp thorns. The tip of his tail pierced through the upper jaw of the giant crocodile with a whoosh\!

"Whoosh\!"

He swung his butt and actually threw the four to five-meter-long giant crocodile ashore\!

The cold father lay on the ground, dumbfounded.

Mei Mei immediately rushed up and raised her light blue claws. With a whoosh, she pierced through the giant crocodile's leather armor and cut open its entire back and head\!

This terrifying underwater killer had just come ashore and died instantly before he could struggle\!

Waves started to stir in the river.

Strands of blood floated up from the bottom of the river.

A black mass of giant figures jumped crazily at the bottom of the river.

Aisha stood on the shore and let out a miserable and terrified roar, calling for her son anxiously.

The cold father looked at the water in a daze.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei could not help but jump down anxiously.

Although they did not know how to dive, they could not watch helplessly as their brother fought these ferocious enemies in the water alone.

Even if they died, they would die together\!

Just as they jumped into the water, they immediately held their breaths and sank.

However, just as they sank into the water, they widened their eyes and saw an unbelievable scene\!

The water was dyed red with blood.

Their brother was spraying air from behind and running around underwater with a whoosh. His speed was indescribable\!

Those giant crocodiles could not even touch his fur and turned into lambs waiting to be slaughtered. Their flesh was torn by the two golden claws and they fled in panic.

In a moment, the bottom of the river was filled with the broken corpses of those giant crocodiles\!

The remaining two giant crocodiles no longer cared about their hunger and fled in panic.

Soon, Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail could not breathe.

They immediately surfaced and panted heavily.

Aisha and the other lionesses on the shore were still calling out anxiously.

The cold father stood on the shore and saw that only the two of them had surfaced. His heart sank as he stared blankly at the terrifying red blood on the water.

Many crocodile corpses floated up from the water and rushed downstream with the water.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei hurriedly swam towards the shore.

They knew that their brother was fine. With his speed in the water just now, not to mention crocodiles, even the fish that knew how to swim the most could not catch up to him\!

They had to go ashore quickly to avoid implicating their brother.

Aisha and the other lionesses seemed to have guessed something when they saw that only the two of them had come up.

Aisha's scream was miserable and sorrowful.

Before Little Curly Tail could tell her, the river water behind him splashed\!

Then, Chu Xiaoye flew out from the water. Black smoke sprayed from his back as he flew ashore and landed steadily.

Aisha and the other lionesses were pleasantly surprised to see this. They hurriedly ran over to rub his head to comfort him. In the end, just as they ran close, they were enveloped by the black smoke.

"Ugh —"

The four female lions lay on the ground and vomited.

The cold father saw that the situation was bad and had already retreated into the distance.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly put away the black smoke and shook the fur on his body.

Just now, at the bottom of the water, he finally understood the direction his body moved in when the black smoke was sprayed and the way he used his claws when he was moving at a high speed. When he first tested his skills, he killed all the giant crocodiles\!

It seemed that his big smelly fart could not only be used as a nuclear weapon, but also as a ejector. He could move freely in the water and make himself faster and more agile on the shore\!

Most importantly, he felt that the smelly farts in his body seemed to be endless and could not be released completely. It was unbelievable.

Could it be that this gas was not completely the waste gas produced in his body? Perhaps it was also an energy? Just like strength, it could be used constantly. Even if it was exhausted, it could recover quickly?

If that was the case, the practicality of this thing was definitely not inferior to his golden claw.

When fighting an enemy, he could use this gas to control his speed and strength. He could use all sorts of roundabout battles and make all sorts of difficult movements that the enemy would never think of\!

He was extremely excited at the thought of this.

He decided to try it on the shore again to see the effect.

At this moment.

Mei Mei kept thinking of her brother's heroic scene when he was shooting air currents at the bottom of the water and fighting the giant crocodiles. Her gaze when she looked at her brother was filled with admiration and respect.

Therefore, she quietly approached her brother's butt again and stuck her head over.

Just as she stuck out her tongue with admiration and was about to express her admiration for her brother, there was an explosion and black smoke suddenly sprayed on her face like a huge wave\!

"Whoosh —"

Chu Xiaoye flew forward\!

As for Mei Mei, her fur flew backward and she was blasted backward\!

The siblings, one in front and one in the back, flew lightly and miserably, looking comical and laughable.

Chu Xiaoye did not control his farts well and let out too much at once. He did not have the time to react. With a bang, he pierced into the hill in front of him, and his entire head almost crawled into the mud\!

As for Mei Mei, she quickly rolled back in midair. Then, with a bang, she sat on the ground and was stunned on the spot.

The other members of the pride of the cold father froze in place, dumbfounded.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail immediately lay on the ground and looked at Mei Mei. He laughed hysterically and rolled around.

When the sky was about to turn dark.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride of the cold father back to the bushes.

At this moment, Catherine, who had gone to the border to patrol, had already returned.

Under her feet was the head of a black lioness. The blood on it had yet to coagulate, and it looked like it had just been killed.

Chu Xiaoye knew that the black lions would definitely not let the matter rest after losing so many members.

This black lioness was clearly a scout from the black pride who had come to investigate the situation of their team. Unexpectedly, Catherine had discovered her and she did not return.

From the looks of it, the black lions were probably gathering their team and would pounce over soon.

It was also possible that when they saw that there were not many lions that could fight here, they would send out some powerful black lions to sneak in and assassinate them.

Regardless of the situation, it was not good news for Chu Xiaoye's team.

However, they had to resist this wave of attack. In this way, they could give the newly joined pride confidence to occupy this land more firmly and continue to expand the team, waiting to counterattack.

They could not afford any failure in their current situation.

One failure might completely disintegrate their team.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye had to be vigilant and make the other party have no chance.

He assigned tasks to Catherine, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the tiger leopard sisters. Every day, during the day and night, they had to act as scouts and scout the situation ahead to prevent the enemy from suddenly attacking.

As for the other members, they had their own missions.

Aisha and the others continued to be in charge of hunting.

The cold father could be used as a beacon to pass messages or patrol at night.

As for Tilly, Chu Xiaoye could not order her around. When she was interested, she would follow him to patrol and hunt. When she was not interested, she would wander around. As long as she did not cause trouble, Chu Xiaoye would thank the heavens.

However, this female cub behaved very obediently in front of Aisha and the other female lions. She always used her speed and sharp claws to help them quickly subdue their prey.

Molly's relationship with Mei Mei grew better and better, while her relationship with Little Curly Tail grew worse and worse.

Little Curly Tail always opposed her and always used his tail to slap her when she was not paying attention. This made this hot-tempered lioness gnash her teeth at him in hatred.

However, under Mei Mei's mediation, they rarely could fight.

Furthermore, Molly was no match for Little Curly Tail, and she did not dare to really pounce on him and attack.

Usually, Chu Xiaoye would ignore this situation.

In the past, when Little Curly Tail bullied Mei Mei, he would beat him up if he saw him. Now that he saw Little Curly Tail bullying this female cub, he did not react. This made Little Curly Tail even more fearless.

"Brother doesn't like this lioness cub either\! Continue beating her up\!"

However, Little Curly Tail did not know that every time Chu Xiaoye saw his and Molly's expressions, he would look at them strangely.

There was something wrong with the cold father these two days.

During the day, the sun was hot and everyone was sleeping in the shadows. As for him, he crawled into the bushes and no one knew where he went. He only returned in the evening every time.

Furthermore, he always smelled sour. Sometimes, when he walked, he could not help but twist his butt a few times. However, the expression on his face was still dignified, cold, and kingly.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the leisure to care about these things.

Recently, he had been practicing his farting divine art and felt that he was becoming stronger and more proficient.
