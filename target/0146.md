Chapter 146: Gorilla

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his front palm and slapped the head of the white-haired gorilla that was biting his hind leg\!

Its body trembled and it immediately let go of its teeth and fell to the ground.

Blood flowed out of its nose and ears.

It died instantly\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the lioness corpse on the ground and did not have time to think. He immediately rushed towards the gorillas on the brothers' side.

The few gorillas were extremely terrified when they saw their three leading companions fall to the ground. They hurriedly roared and fled\!

They jumped onto the tree and quickly jumped between the trees. In a moment, they had already disappeared without a trace\!

The brothers' faces were covered in blood and scratches, and their eyes were filled with fear and frustration.

They, two adult lions, were actually unable to defeat a few monkeys. They were really ashamed.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and walked in front of the three white-haired gorillas. He stared at their bodies, his eyes filled with bewilderment.

The muscles of these gorillas' two arms were extremely developed, and their bodies were powerful and huge. When they fought, they were extremely crazy and were not something that an ordinary gorilla could compare to.

In just one night, he saw a huge crocodile, a powerful leopard, a python, and these few ferocious and powerful gorillas.

It seemed that this forest was even more dangerous than he had imagined.

The animals here were generally more powerful and warlike than those elsewhere. Perhaps it was not just because of the abundant food and resources.

"Roar\!"

At this moment, a childish cry came from a nearby bush.

Then, the female cub walked out of the bushes and ran to her mother's side, trembling.

Her mother had already become a few pieces of corpses and could no longer nurture and protect her.

Chu Xiaoye knew that animals and humans would be sad too.

However, their sadness should not be too deep or long, right?

After all, survival was too difficult.

They had to work hard at all times to survive.

This female cub stood in front of her mother in a daze, lowering her head to smell the scent on her mother's corpse. She did not know how she felt at this moment.

Chu Xiaoye originally thought that she was already dead.

It seemed that in order to save her, her mother attracted all three gorillas and sacrificed herself to save her.

She should live well.

At least, she should not let her mother down.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to be sad with her. He went over and picked up a gorilla, signaling the brothers to come over and pick up the corpses of the other two gorillas.

This was their food.

A battle had happened here. The other carnivores in the forest would rush over soon.

The few escaping gorillas might also return to take revenge with more companions.

Therefore, they had to leave this place as soon as possible and travel through the night.

At this moment, the little elephant, who had run far away to eat tender leaves and had forgotten to return, rushed back. When it saw the scene in front of it, it was shocked.

Chu Xiaoye ignored it and left quickly with the gorilla's corpse in his mouth.

The little elephant immediately followed behind.

The brothers each held the corpse of a gorilla in their mouths and followed closely.

Duoya looked up at them and then at her mother. Then, she quickly followed.

She had to live.

They walked until dawn.

In the canyon, the river became even more rapid.

When the sun rose, all sorts of bird cries and monkeys rang out from the forest on both sides of the river.

The forest that had been silent for the night immediately became lively.

Chu Xiaoye stopped at a riverbank and put down the corpse of the gorilla in his mouth. He looked at the exhausted female cub following behind.

Doya looked up at him too.

Then, she walked over and came in front of him. She lowered her head and leaned down slightly, showing enough obedience and respect.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and walked to the river, looking at the opposite shore.

The river twisted upwards, but it was too steep and there was no path left.

If he wanted to continue forward and reach the other side of the mountain, he had to cross this river and reach the other side of the river. He had to walk from there.

Doya looked at him silently, then walked in front of the gorilla's corpse and started eating carefully.

The Chino brothers were also hungry and started to eat the corpses of the other two gorillas.

Little Elephant came to the river and stood beside Chu Xiaoye. It stuck its long nose into the water and prepared to get some water to drink.

It sniffed the water and sent it into its mouth.

Just as it reached its nose into the water for the second time to suck in water, it suddenly jumped up with a whoosh. Its nose was suddenly raised high and it let out a roar\!

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere and a few sparkling fish followed its nose and flew up from the water\!

A fish happened to land on the shore.

Before it could jump into the water, Chu Xiaoye extended his foot and pressed it tightly.

When he saw its mouth full of sharp and dense teeth, Chu Xiaoye was shocked.

This fish was like those piranhas that even humans would change their expressions at the mention of it\!

However, piranhas were mostly distributed on the Amazon River. How could they appear here?

Could this be another species?

Chu Xiaoye stared at the fish in bewilderment for a while before turning around and looking at the small elephant beside him.

Blood flowed out of the tip of the elephant's long nose and it swayed in pain. Clearly, it had been bitten by these fish with sharp teeth.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and walked towards the female cub.

Duoya was greedily eating the gorilla's corpse. Seeing him walk over, she hurriedly got up and made way. Her mouth was full of blood and she was extremely respectful.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at her. He walked in front of the gorilla's corpse, lowered his head, and bit a piece of internal organs. He turned around and walked to the river. He loosened his mouth and threw the piece of bloody internal organs down.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as the piece of internal organs fell into the water, before it sank to the bottom, the waves immediately churned. A group of bright red fish jumped out from the water and started fighting crazily\!

In the blink of an eye, the piece of internal organs was eaten clean, and not a trace of blood was left\!

When the small elephant standing by the river saw this terrifying scene, it immediately retreated in fright, not even daring to drink water.

Chu Xiaoye's expression changed slightly.

It seemed that there was really a group of killers as terrifying as piranhas hiding at the bottom of the river.

Then, how should they go over?

The river was four to five meters wide. It was impossible to jump over.

Furthermore, the riverbanks on both sides were filled with sand or mud. They did not have any point to exert strength on.

Even the jumping expert, gazelles, could only sigh at the river.

If the little elephant turned into a big elephant, perhaps it could push some trees into the river and use them as wooden bridges.

They would usually push down trees to eat the tender leaves on the branches.

However, this elephant clearly did not have the strength.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the river and thought hard.

The road ahead could not be advanced anymore. If he did not think of a way to pass through here, he could only return the way he came and pass through a certain narrow area downstream.

However, they had already walked so far. If they returned, they would clearly waste more time and energy.

Doya was full.

She saw him and quietly came behind him, also looking at the other side of the river.

The Chino brothers also licked their mouths and walked over.

They all knew that their boss or their future king wanted to cross this river and go to the other side.

However, the river was so rapid and there was an invisible danger lurking at the bottom. How could they go over?

Obviously, they could not pass.

In their opinion, it was better to return the way they came and leave this terrifying forest. They could go straight to the grassland, occupy the territory, and fight everywhere\!

The grassland was heaven for lions\!

Their future king had extraordinary strength. He could definitely become a super lion king on the grassland that would make all his enemies and his kind tremble in fear\!

They looked forward to that day\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, on the upper reaches of the river dozens of meters away from them, a figure suddenly jumped up from a big tree on the riverbank. As if it had wings, it flew across the river and landed on the other side\!

Just as they were shocked, two more figures followed closely. With a whoosh, they jumped out of the branch of the big tree and flew up high, crossing the river and landing steadily on the other side of the river\!

That posture was light, smooth, calm, and agile. It was even better than a monkey's jumping skills\!

Then, the three figures quickly crawled into the forest on the other side and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye was dumbfounded.

If he was not wrong, the first figure that jumped over was the strong leopard he encountered last night.

The two figures that jumped behind them, one big and one small, were actually the leopard and daughter pair who had previously lived behind the pride camp of the cold father\!

He was too familiar with that figure\!

They had actually come here too\!

He had long known that leopards' jumping ability was extraordinary. The distance they could jump on the tree could sometimes even reach more than ten meters. They were extremely good at jumping and often hunted monkeys and squirrels on the tree.

However, he never would have thought that they would actually perform such a shocking act in front of him when he was at his wits' end. This was simply slapping his face\!

He was the future king of the grassland\!

Did they want to snatch his King's Light with a mere jump?

Don't even think about it\!

He decided that the next time he saw that little leopard, he would definitely let out a stench on her again\!

Of course, he was not bullying her because he felt embarrassed\!

He only wanted her to know that underage children could not jump around in front of a future lion king\!

This was the rule\!

The tree was born by the river.

The thick tree trunk was bent towards the river, and some branches almost extended into the middle of the river.

It was indeed a good place to jump\!

"Roar\!"

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

Right at this moment, a series of roars suddenly sounded from the forest behind him\!

The vegetation rustled and roars rose and fell\!

Then, a group of strong gorillas charged out of the forest aggressively with anger and hatred\!
