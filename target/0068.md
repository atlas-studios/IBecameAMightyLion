Chapter 68: Common Enemies\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The two hyena guards beside the hyena queen finally came to their senses. In a hurry, they bared their fangs and pounced ferociously\!

Chu Xiaoye did not let go of the hyena queen's neck. Instead, he raised his head and picked her up, looking coldly at the two hyena guards that pounced over.

He neither dodged nor retreated.

Just like that, he stood in place and looked at them coldly.

The two female hyenas had just pounced in front of them when they hurriedly stopped in their tracks. They were frightened by his calm and cold aura and hesitated, not daring to move forward.

There was a silent confrontation.

Not far away, the chaotic cries of other hyenas and the furious roars of the pride could be heard.

The battle was continuing.

The hyena queen opened her mouth and finally swallowed her last breath in despair.

Chu Xiaoye let go of her and threw her to the ground.

The two female hyenas took advantage of the moment that he lowered his head to bare their fangs and pounce on him\!

They would be candidates for the Queen\!

If they killed this cub and took revenge for the previous queen, they would be protected and respected even more\!

"Whoosh\!"

Under the bright sun, a strange golden light suddenly flashed in front of their eyes\!

The cub jumped up high and jumped behind them.

A female hyena hurriedly turned around\!

As for the other female hyena, it stood in place without moving.

Then, the motionless female hyena suddenly let out a miserable scream. Then, it fell to the ground and rolled around in pain\!

The flesh on half of its face was grabbed off, revealing its white bones\!

"Oh —"

The female hyena that had turned around was terrified when it saw this scene. It turned around and ran\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye rushed up, jumped up, and pounced on its back. He suddenly bit its spine\!

"Crack\!"

The sound of bones breaking could be heard\!

The female hyena's body turned limp and she fell to the ground.

It let out a scream and hurriedly turned its head, wanting to bite with all its might to take revenge\!

However, Chu Xiaoye did not give it any chance.

The moment its spine broke, Chu Xiaoye had already jumped up and rushed towards the bushes not far away\!

Lars bit another hyena to death.

However, he was already riddled with wounds.

There were also two hyenas whose eyes were red and they were biting him crazily.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye rushed over at lightning speed and pounced on one of the hyenas, biting its neck\!

At the same time, his right claw pierced into the body of another hyena from the side with a whoosh and he suddenly pulled\!

"Whoosh\!"

Blood and organs surged out\!

Before the two hyenas could react, one had its neck bitten and the other had its stomach cut open\!

The hyena that had its stomach cut open was suddenly stunned. It froze in place and stopped biting Lars.

Then, it turned around and looked at its body and the internal organs on the ground.

Then, he fell to the ground, his eyes wide open as he twitched in confusion and fear.

Another hyena with its neck bitten off also crawled on the ground with its mouth open and did not move.

As for the attacker, he had already jumped out of the bushes and run far away.

Just like their queen, they did not see the appearance of the attacker clearly\!

Lars curled up in the bushes, his mouth full of blood and body trembling. He looked in shock at the figure that ran towards the female lions.

He thought that he was seeing things\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail was covered in blood as he protected Aisha. He was already exhausted.

The mother and son stood side by side, panting heavily, but they were still baring their fangs and looking exceptionally fierce\!

The few hyenas surrounding them did not dare to pounce on them again at that moment\!

On the other side, Mei Mei had also exhausted her strength. She could only retreat to their side and lean on them.

Her mother, Xi'er, and the lioness with a broken tail protected Callie and Maya\!

The four female lions worked together and fought together\!

At this moment, facing this group of cunning enemies, the entire pride was surprisingly united\!

The hyenas were afraid.

Especially when their queen had already disappeared and stopped crying.

They stopped attacking, feeling terrified and uneasy, but they stood in place extremely unwillingly.

They seemed to be waiting for the Queen to appear.

Although they had suffered heavy losses, the pride was already at the end of its flight and only lacked one last attack\!

The glory of defeating the pride and the delicious prey were waving at them\!

Victory belonged to them\!

However.

Their queen did not appear.

What appeared was an exceptionally ferocious cub that was as fast as lightning\!

Chu Xiaoye pounced into the hyena pack surrounding Little Curly Tail and his mother and bit the spine of a hyena\!

Then, he jumped up and suddenly clawed at the head of another hyena\!

The hyena raised its mouth ferociously and bared its sharp fangs, preparing to bite off his claws\!

However, only half of its opened mouth was left\!

Its entire lower jaw was cut to the ground\!

Blood sprayed out\!

It still raised its head and opened its lonely upper jaw in a daze, preparing to bite.

The other hyenas that were about to attack Chu Xiaoye immediately retreated in a hurry when they saw this scene, their eyes filled with fear.

Xi'er and the other lionesses had their backs facing the hyenas in front of them and did not see this scene.

As for Little Curly Tail, Aisha, and Mei Mei, they saw it clearly\!

Although Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei had long known how powerful their brother was and how sharp his claws were, they still did not expect their brother to be able to scratch this hyena's lower jaw with one slash\!

How sharp was that\!

As for Aisha, she was frozen in place. She widened her eyes and looked at her son in a daze.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and pounced ferociously at another hyena\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei seemed to have been reignited by their brother's courage and strength\!

Although they were injured and exhausted, they immediately pulled themselves together and followed their brother, pouncing ferociously\!

The three siblings were like wolves that had entered a herd of sheep. They were invincible and no dog could compare to them\!

The ten-over hyenas surrounding him immediately dispersed in panic and fled in fear\!

However, there were still a few that were pounced on by the ferocious three young cubs and siblings, who bit them crazily\!

On the other side, the ten-over hyenas were terrified when they saw this scene and dispersed\!

Xi'er and the other three female lions immediately took this opportunity to muster their courage and roar as they chased after him\!

The hatred, anger, despair, and fear in their hearts turned into ferocious strength at this moment\!

At this moment.

Lars was also covered in blood. He roared as he ran back and pounced at the fleeing hyenas\!

The lion, the cold father, also took advantage of the hyenas' panic to bite the neck of a hyena\!

They won by a landslide\!

The hyenas that had lost their queen's command fled in panic under the furious and ferocious counterattack of the pride\!

"Roar—"

The lion and lionesses roared\!

The entire pride shared a common enemy and was invincible\!
