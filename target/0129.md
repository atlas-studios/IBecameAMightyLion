Chapter 129: Humans

Indeed.

This tiger was related to humans\!

If it was 009, did that mean that there was still 008, 007, or 011, 012?

Or could there be a B series?

This tiger was so intelligent and so strong. Could it be that they had injected some kind of gene into its body?

Some crazy human organizations could do anything under the guise of scientific research\!

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail looked at the dead ferocious beast at the bottom of the pit and smelled the strong smell of blood. His eyes were filled with excitement.

He wanted to go down and eat a feast.

However, he was destined to not eat this feast.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at him, signaling him to go to the camp to bring the warthog over.

After Little Curly Tail left with his orders, Chu Xiaoye looked at Catherine, who was beside him, and gestured for her to go to the tree and take down the bow.

Let the traces of humans disappear tonight.

Little Curly Tail brought the warthog.

Catherine brought the bow.

Chu Xiaoye gestured to Catherine to throw everything into the pit, including the two bags of arrows.

Although Catherine was puzzled, she did not hesitate and immediately threw everything down.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the tiger at the bottom of the pit and the number on its legs one last time. Then, he raised his foot and pushed a handful of soil into the pit.

He turned around and looked at the warthog.

The warthog was stunned for a moment before it immediately understood. It hurriedly went in front of the pit, lowered its head, and worked hard to fill the pit.

Little Curly Tail was stunned and anxious when he saw this. He looked eagerly at the prey at the bottom of the pit.

This big fellow was enough for him to eat for a few days\!

Why did his brother bury it?

Catherine looked blankly at the bow and arrows at the bottom of the pit, her eyes filled with reluctance.

However, she still supported and trusted him from the bottom of her heart.

His thoughts were always different from the others and puzzled them, but they were always surprisingly right.

He must have seen something they could not.

The night quietly retreated.

When dawn arrived, the cold father returned with the female lions.

From their round stomachs and happy expressions, they had gained a lot last night and eaten enough.

However, no one remembered the little fellows who protected their home and killed the enemy at all costs in the night.

The cold father looked pleased with himself. He looked at them calmly and yawned. Then, he went over and lay in the shade of the bushes with his eyes closed.

After eating and drinking their fill, they naturally had to sleep.

The female lions were a little surprised to see that they were all injured.

However, only Aisha and Xi'er walked over, rubbed their heads, comforted them, and licked their wounds.

Chu Xiaoye looked at their bulging stomachs and decided even more firmly.

Even without him, the pride would live well.

This was letting nature take its course and conforming to the natural law of survival.

Chu Xiaoye was very hungry.

The prey they had just eaten yesterday was hungry because of the consumption last night.

His need for food grew and became more and more exaggerated.

A week later.

The wounds on their bodies finally healed.

The warthog was still alive.

During the day, he wandered in the bushes nearby, and at night, he was brought to the tree by Little Curly Tail to sleep.

Life was wonderful.

Because it had done a great job that night and gave out the alarm in time when the tiger attacked, Chu Xiaoye decided to spare its life and gave it the name "Pit", hoping that it would continue to dig holes to protect the cubs and kill the enemy.

After Chu Xiaoye's might last time, the cold father and the female lions no longer dared to covet the food on this pig and tree.

He had already become the true lion king of this pride.

In the eyes of Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei, he was the most qualified lion to be king in this pride\!

The cold father was dejected and became melancholic.

He also restrained his temper a lot.

However, he was secretly rejoicing. From the two boys' current attitude, they did not seem to be preparing to occupy the pride and this territory, nor were they preparing to chase him out and wander.

This was definitely a very fortunate and rare thing for him or all the lions on the grassland.

He no longer had to worry about being chased out and wandering all day long, dying of hunger or being bitten to death by other competitors.

It was good to be able to survive here.

As for the title and dignity of the lion king, he could have it or not.

However, clearly, that kid did not seem to have thought of becoming a lion king. He did not even have the intention to pee and mark the borders of the territory.

This puzzled him.

The claws of the dry season had already quietly reached into the bushes and were trying to destroy the green land.

In the bushes, the grass on the ground was already withered.

Even many thorny bushes lost their leaves and hung their heads, looking lifeless.

The trees in the forest mostly turned bare.

The once damp ground also became dry and hard, and even started to crack.

The temperature increased with it, and day after day, the land was cruelly roasted.

The pride felt uncomfortable.

Especially the cold father with a lush mane. At this moment, he wished he could tear off all the mane on his neck and his thick skin\!

However, fortunately, they raised a diligent warthog.

In order to repay their kindness of not killing and to show their value, Pit dug a wide opening under every bush in the camp. The deep and open pit was enough for every lion to hide in to avoid the heat and cool down.

The pride was already used to his existence.

Now that they saw that he was so useful, even the cold father was not so fierce to him anymore.

At this moment.

Under the hot sun, the members of the pride hid in the cave to rest.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was lying in the cave thinking about something, a bang suddenly came from the distant grassland\!

The cold father and the female lions opened their eyes and stuck their heads out of the cave. They looked around in confusion before continuing to curl up and sleep.

They did not care.

Perhaps it was the muffled thunder of nature.

However, Chu Xiaoye was shocked\!

This was a gunshot\!

He got up from the cave and raised his head to look at the distant grassland.

Did anyone come to poach during this season?

He felt a little uneasy and thought of the tiger buried in the bushes at the back.

He wondered if those humans would come and find this disappeared test subject.

He turned around and walked into the bushes at the back, coming to the place where the tiger was buried.

The ground was flat and full of withered leaves.

Just as he was thinking about something, he suddenly heard a whoosh\!

Then, he felt a sharp pain on his neck\!

An arrow hit him\!

However, the arrowhead did not seem to have pierced into his muscles\!

He only felt a chill quickly flowing out of the arrowhead and surging throughout his body.

He instantly felt his muscles turn numb and his entire body lose its strength. The scene in front of him started to blur\!

This seemed to be an anesthetic arrow\!

At the same time, the sounds of humans speaking and footsteps could be heard.

He suddenly came to his senses and bit his tongue hard. At the same time, the mysterious heat in his abdomen instantly flowed throughout his body, repelling the coldness\!

He immediately sobered up and hurriedly jumped up, escaping towards the territory of the Seno brothers' pride\!

He did not know the intentions of these humans. He could not run towards the camp\!

Otherwise, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine would risk their lives to save him.

No matter how powerful they were, how could they be a match for a human with a gun?

The noisy and hurried footsteps of the humans sounded from behind\!

They chased up\!

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that they had only come for him and not to hunt the entire pride.

Was it because they had caught his abnormality with the camera, or was it because of those golden claws?

He did not know.

He only knew that no matter what, he could not fall into their hands.

These butchers could do anything\!

He had to hold on and not fall\!

The sun was blazing and hot air assaulted his face.

He passed through the bushes and ran for his life on the withered grassland\!
