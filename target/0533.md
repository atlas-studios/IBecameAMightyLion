Chapter 533: The King's Path\!

In the main tent.

Chu Xiaoye, Lanisi, and the others were tied to a row of sturdy wooden stakes.

These wooden stakes seemed to be specially made for them. They were tall, short, and suitable. Their thickness was different. Every person tied them on it was just right.

When Geck Lusni's footsteps reached the door, the young general's angry voice came first.

"Princess Carter, please allow me to execute them on the spot and dig out their hearts to take revenge for my brother\!"

Then, the curtain was opened and a tall and handsome young orc rushed in angrily. He walked very quickly and his entire body emitted a cold aura like that of steel.

Carter followed in and said, "General Geck, shouldn't you ask why these elves want to kill your brother?"

The tall and sturdy Ha'er dragged his saber, opened the door curtain, and walked in.

Geck did not seem to have sensed anything, and he did not bring any guards in.

He had a long sword hanging at his waist and was wearing black armor. He stared coldly at the few elves tied to the wooden stake and gritted his teeth. "There's no point. Now, I want to take revenge for my brother. I want these murderers to accompany my brother and sleep underground\!"

"Clang\!"

He pulled out the sword at his waist and walked in front of Lanisi, saying hatefully, "Let's start with this red-haired elf\!"

Carter followed and nodded. "Then, General Geck, please. It's best to cut off her head. In that case, I'll be happy too."

Ha'er dragged his saber and walked over slowly.

Geck said angrily, "Princess, be careful. Blood will splash all over you\!"

After saying that, he suddenly swung the sword in his hand and slashed at Carter, who was standing on the left.

At this moment, Ha'er's saber also slashed at him with a whoosh.

Carter's expression changed and he hurriedly retreated.

"Clang\!"

Sparks flew\!

Ha'er's saber collided heavily with Geck's sword.

Their bodies trembled and they took a few steps back.

Carter said with a dark expression, "General Geck, what's the meaning of this?"

Geck sneered at her and said, "Princess Carter, do you want to hide this little trick from my general?"

Right at this moment, the sound of weapons colliding suddenly came from outside.

At the same time, a guard at the door said quickly, "Princess, leave quickly. The imperial guards have rebelled\! The Geck army suddenly appeared a kilometer away\! Ah—"

Just as he finished speaking, he let out a scream and fell to the ground.

The five hundred imperial guards were the special guards that Carter enjoyed as a member of the royal family. They had always been stationed outside the main tent to protect her. Now, they had suddenly changed sides and become traitors in this operation\!

There were still seven to eight thousand people loyal to Carter, but they could not rush over at once.

At this moment, the fighting outside the tent had already ended.

The five hundred imperial guards surrounded this place. As long as they waited for Geck's army to arrive, they could completely destroy Carter's eight thousand strong army\!

"Whoosh\!"

The curtain was lifted and the real Geck walked in with the fourteen guards.

The previous Geck suddenly raised his hand and tore off a layer of skin on his face, revealing his scarred face.

"Princess Carter, you shouldn't be like this. My Lusni family was loyal to your royal family, but now, we have been betrayed. You killed my brother yourself, right?"

Geck looked mockingly at the princess general in front of him, as if he was a lion that had been on the battlefield for a long time and was looking at a young cub.

Carter's face turned pale. He took a few steps back and stood beside Chu Xiaoye.

"Pfft\!"

Geck suddenly pulled out his sword and pierced through Ha'er's body.

Ha'er held the saber and fell to the ground.

"Your Highness, I can still give you a chance now."

Geck took out a white cloth and wiped his sword lovingly. Then, he looked at her and said, "It's a pity if all eight thousand of your soldiers die. You should go out and tell them to put down their weapons and be loyal to me. What do you think?"

The sounds of battle outside were getting closer and closer.

The eight thousand soldiers loyal to Carter were charging over, wanting to save their princess.

The five hundred imperial guards surrounding the tent were doing their best to resist.

Geck threw away the bloody cloth napkin in his hand and smiled. "It's fine if these 500 imperial guards die. I won't feel sorry for them. Since they've betrayed you, Princess, they might betray me one day. Your Highness, you don't have much time. Other than the conditions I just mentioned, there are two other conditions. As long as you agree, you'll still be a princess. Other than the army, you won't lose anything."

Carter stared at him coldly and did not speak.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's words from last night replayed in her mind again. Now, it seemed that he was right. She seemed to be foolproof and had a high chance of success. In fact, as long as she made a mistake, she would be doomed.

She was very smart, but that did not mean that others were stupid.

As for this General Geck, he had already been famous for many years. How could he be deceived by her so easily?

"I have already said the first condition. Let your army put down their weapons and swear loyalty to me. The second condition is that I want you to kill these elves personally, dig out their hearts, and bury my brother with them\!"

At this point, a meaningful smile appeared in Geck's eyes. He looked at her and said, "As for the third condition, it's very simple. If you want to marry me, you'll consummate the marriage with me tonight. You're originally a woman of my Lusni family. Since my brother is already dead, you're mine. Princess Carter, in the future, I'll be the successor of the Lusni family. Your royal family needs you and the Kast Empire needs me. Therefore, I'll be your most trusted and dazzling husband. What do you think?"

Carter leaned against Chu Xiaoye tightly.

Chu Xiaoye could feel that she was trembling.

The first time she fought for power, she ended in failure. The blow to this ambitious girl could be imagined.

Geck looked at the elf youth behind her with a puzzled gaze. He turned his head and said to the orc youth who had previously played him, "Nudge, cut off the elf kid's head."

The orc youth bowed, held his sword, and walked over.

Just as she walked close, Carter suddenly bent down and lowered her head. With a whoosh, Chu Xiaoye suddenly swung the sword in his hand from behind her. With a crack, he cut the sword in the orc youth's hand. Then, his remaining strength did not weaken and he slashed at the orc youth's neck with a puff.

Blood sprayed and the broken sword fell to the ground.

The orc youth's head flew off his neck.

The headless corpse stood for a few seconds before falling to the ground.

At this moment, the female elves suddenly broke free of the ropes, took out their weapons, and gathered around Chu Xiaoye.

Geck's eyelids twitched. He looked at the corpse on the ground and then at the elf youth. He grinned coldly and said, "Princess Carter, you have a minute at most to consider. I have three conditions and one more. Hand me the elf youth behind you."

The fourteen orc guards behind him held their weapons and surged up. They looked at them covetously, like a group of hungry wolves looking at a few pitiful lambs.

Outside the tent, as long as he gave the order, the guards of the imperial guards would all rush in.

Although those guards were quickly falling.

"One minute is up. Princess Carter, unfortunately, you made the wrong choice."

Geck stopped talking nonsense and said to the fourteen guards, "Kill them all and leave none alive. If possible, leave the princess an intact corpse."

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out from a corner not far from him and pounced at him at lightning speed\!

Catherine had been hiding here for a long time\!

Geck's expression changed. He swung the sword in his hand and slashed.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, two more figures passed by the fourteen guards and pounced at him\!

The moment Catherine rushed out, Chu Xiaoye and Carter, who were in front of him, suddenly lowered their bodies and turned into lions\!

No animal could catch up to the sneak attack and pounce of a cat.

They were natural ambushing experts\!

Almost no one would have thought that three lions would suddenly appear here\!

Furthermore, these three lions were once the most powerful hunters on the grassland\!

Geck, who thought that victory was in his grasp, made a fatal mistake that everyone would make and was too confident.

With the five hundred imperial guards outside and the ten-over guards beside him, if they surged forward, he would have long won.

But now, it was too late to regret.

When the sword in Gecko's hand slashed at Catherine, Chu Xiaoye, Carter, or Alisha had already pounced from behind him at an even faster speed\!

Alisa's sharp teeth pierced through his neck\!

As for Chu Xiaoye's sharp golden claws, they pierced through the hard armor on his body and into his back, penetrating his heart\!

Catherine agilely dodged the ferocious sword.

She was only a pretense to lure the enemy.

Geck widened his eyes and fell into a pool of blood.

At this moment, the little elves also fought the fourteen guards.

Vilis' spinning storm shuttled through the crowd like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves.

Soon, corpses fell to the ground.

Lanisi's sword was also very fast.

As for Denise and Fei'er, they retreated into the distance. The bow in their hands sounded and they attacked with sharp arrows. Every arrow would kill one person\!

Catherine pounced at the remaining orc guards.

Chu Xiaoye and Alisa did not stop for a moment. Like they had previously hunted on the grassland, they pounced bravely at their prey.

The form of lions was not suitable to fight humans who had practiced sword attacks, because the weapons in humans' hands could cover their entire bodies. No matter where they pounced from, they were in danger of being killed.

Therefore, if not for the one-sided situation now, they would definitely not pounce in this form.

They were fourteen orc guards who soon fell into a pool of blood.

The three lions stood together, and Chu Xiaoye stood in front. Alisa and Catherine stood on the left and right behind him.

At this moment, Lanisi and the others looked at them in a daze.

These elven girls never would have thought that this princess of Kast was actually a lion. Furthermore, it seemed that she had a deep relationship with their Lord Night.

The battle outside seemed to be ending soon.

It was already not easy for the 500 Imperial Forest guards to resist until now.

Alisa took a few steps forward and walked in front of her fallen clothes. She turned around and became the orc girl again.

She wore her clothes calmly and did not feel shy.

Chu Xiaoye also recovered to his elf state and wore clothes with her. He even looked at her from time to time.

Lanisi looked at them in a daze, her heart suddenly aching.

It seemed that she had worried for him for nothing last night.

The teeth marks and claw marks on this fellow's body were probably not caused by Lord Carter letting other orcs abuse him. She probably did it herself.

"How shameless\!"

Vilis cursed angrily.

She had been worried the entire night. Until this morning, she was still angry and wanted to find this General Carter to fight. She did not expect this outcome. These two bastards had deceived them\!

"Princess\!"

The curtain was opened and a group of orcs ran in with weapons that were still bleeding.

The five hundred rebellious imperial forest guards were all killed.

When these orcs saw that their princess was fine, they immediately knelt on the ground and heaved a sigh of relief.

Outside the camp, the sound of rolling iron hooves and the roars of orcs suddenly came.

Geck's army had arrived\!

Carter regained the arrogance of a princess and the dignity of a general. He said calmly, "Form up and welcome the enemy\!"

"Yes\!"

The orcs rushed out.

Carter picked up the sword on the ground, cut off Geck's head, and strode out.

Chu Xiaoye brought the elven girls and followed behind her.

Geck's ten thousand troops had already roared and rushed in front of the camp.

The orcs in the camp had already gathered and were preparing to fight.

Carter rode her warhorse and brought his guards out of the crowd. She stood at the entrance of the camp and raised the head of Geck in her hand. She shouted, "Geck is dead\! The soldiers under him can be forgiven if they put down their weapons\!"

The Geck army rushed close and immediately strangled the warhorse under them.

They knew this Princess Carter and saw the head in her hand.

The expressions of the soldiers following behind changed drastically when they saw this scene.

Their general was actually dead\!

As for treason and secret communication with the Bolton Kingdom, who would believe that?

"That's not our general\! That's General Geck's substitute\! Our general is still in the army camp. Let's rush in, kill these thieves, and save our general\!"

Vice Commander Lawton raised the sword in his hand and shouted.

The other leaders and captains beside him hurriedly raised the sword in their hands and shouted, "Charge in\! Kill these thieves\! Save the general\!"

The soldiers behind raised their weapons and prepared to kill.

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly threw out his head and face and said loudly, "This is your general's substitute\! Geck betrayed the country and secretly colluded with the Bolton Kingdom to assassinate the princess. He even attempted to lead you to defect to the enemy and surrender my border city to the Bolton Kingdom\! He has been executed\! Those who put down their weapons can be forgiven\!"

The moment these words were spoken, the orc army that had been roaring angrily and preparing to sprint immediately fell silent.

"Bullshit\!"

The vice commander, Lawton, immediately cursed angrily. Then, he raised the sword in his hand and said, "Everyone, don't listen to this kid's nonsense\! Our general is loyal to the country and will never betray the country\! Let's charge in and kill these thieves who tried to kill our general\! Save the general\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked back.

"Whoosh\!"

An arrow shot out and pierced through the vice commander's neck\!

He opened his mouth and fell from the warhorse, saying another word.

The other generals beside him were shocked.

Chu Xiaoye immediately said loudly, "Those who put down their weapons can be forgiven\! Geck committed treason and has committed a heinous crime that implicated the family\! Whoever dares to continue following him will be guilty of treason\! Your wives, children, parents, family, and family will all be punished because of your stupidity\! Your wives will become the playthings of other men\! Your children will become other people's slaves\! Your elderly parents and family will be tortured\!"

The moment this was said, the expressions of the soldiers who were still restless and hesitant changed drastically and they were terrified.

"The princess is here\! Quickly put down your weapons and surrender\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared again, like a lion's roar surging out of his chest, causing the eardrums of the soldiers at the front to buzz.

"Clang\!"

Some weapons fell to the ground.

Then, more weapons were thrown to the ground.

"Everyone, don't believe him\! Let's charge in and kill…"

"Whoosh\!"

A deputy general wanted to struggle, but his throat was pierced by Denise's arrow. His cries immediately stopped\!

"Those who surrender are not guilty\! The Princess will make a vow here\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted again.

At these words, the soldiers who were still a little hesitant no longer hesitated. They put down their weapons and knelt on the ground.

Hence, the ten thousand plus orc soldiers started to kneel down in groups. In the end, all of them put down their weapons and knelt down, begging for the princess's forgiveness.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Carter.

Carter looked at him with her amber eyes burning.

"Princess, please vow\!"

Chu Xiaoye whispered.

Carter sat on her warhorse and raised her chin. She looked at the orc army outside the camp and said loudly, "Today, I, Carter Danota, vow here that those who serve me are not guilty\! Those who follow me can be rewarded\! If they disobey, heaven and earth will not tolerate them and the Thunder God will kill them\!"

"We're loyal to the princess\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted.

Then, the orcs' roars resounded throughout the border like thunder.

"We're loyal to the princess\!"

"We're loyal to the princess\!"

Under Chu Xiaoye's suggestion, Carter split the ten thousand orcs and formed a new team. They were all organized with Carter's own eight thousand troops and taken over by her soldiers and captains.

This way, he would not be afraid that they would gather again and riot. Furthermore, he could catch soldiers who still had ill intentions.

Carter was busy for the entire day and was still full of energy.

At the banquet, she brought the wine pot in front of Chu Xiaoye and personally poured him a cup. She said affectionately, "If you did not help me today, I'm afraid I would have failed at the last step. I'll remember this credit for you first and repay you in the future."

However, Chu Xiaoye did not want her to repay it because his body could not take it anymore.

Catherine also enjoyed a seat alone.

Carter walked over and cut off a lamb leg for her with his knife. Then, he filled her wine glass and smiled. "Catherine, thank you too. I've always admired you. You should know that."

Catherine was still cold and ignored her.

Carter was not angry. She walked to Lanisi's table and poured red wine for her. "Your Majesty, thank you for your help today and for sending Night here to meet me. When the elves are in trouble, I'll definitely find a chance to help."

Lanisi looked at her with a complicated gaze, then at the youth opposite her. In the end, she could not help but ask, "You've known Night for a long time, right? You're clearly the princess of the Orc Kingdom, so why can you become a lion?"

Carter smiled. "Your Lord Night is clearly a lion, but why can he become an elf? Your Majesty, I don't have to explain these things. As for my relationship with Night, you should have guessed it too. We did know each other long ago, and the former me was his queen."

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

Lanisi looked surprised. "But as far as I know, every pride has a lion as king. Princess Carter, you're a lioness. You can't be Night's queen."

Beside him, Vilis sneered. "There's no need to be embarrassed. Carter, everyone knows that you were once one of the harem members of the Night Family and were even lower than Catherine, right?"

Carter narrowed her eyes and showed signs of anger.

However, she quickly suppressed the anger in her heart and walked up the steps with a smile. She turned around and said, "No matter what, now, I'm the general of the Orc Kingdom and the princess of Kast. In the future, I, Carter, will be the only king\!"

Chu Xiaoye was afraid that the two of them would bicker again. He hurriedly raised his glass and said, "Drink\! I wish our Princess Carter success in becoming a queen\!"

Carter raised his glass and beamed. "I also wish our Lord Night success in becoming the leader of the harem\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with her. He raised his glass and drank it all.

Lanisi did not want to see them flirting. She said, "Princess Carter, since this matter is resolved, I hope you can keep your promise and let us leave."

"Is it over?"

Carter held his glass and shook his head. "No."

She blinked at Chu Xiaoye and said, "You heard it today. Your Lord Night falsely accused Geck of colluding with the Bolton Kingdom and committed the crime of treason. This crime is not small. The Lusni family will not let the matter rest, let alone surrender. Therefore, soon, the capital will send a letter that I will be summoned to the Holy City and confronted them personally."

Lanisi frowned and said, "Princess, you mean…"

Carter looked at her and said, "And you will follow me to the Holy City."

Lanisi stood up with a hint of anger on her face. "Princess Carter, I'm sorry. I can't agree this time."

Carter said, "Your Majesty, I know that you have something important to do and that your elves are in danger. However, even if I let you go, you might not be able to walk out of Kast safely. I know that you will be going to the human capital and setting off from the Holy City. Perhaps it will be closer. Furthermore, as long as you help me obtain the military authority of the Holy City, you will be unimpeded in the entire Kast Kingdom from now on. Furthermore, I will give you two fire dragons to make you faster."

"Also, I will make the border army give the Bolton Kingdom even more pressure and make it unable to gather its troops to attack your Elf Kingdom."

Lanisi looked at the elf youth opposite her.

"Night, you agreed?"

She felt a little sad. Without their discussion, he had actually reached an agreement with this Princess Carter in private.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly shook his head and said, "Your Majesty, I did not agree. Furthermore, like you, I just learned that General Carter wanted to bring us back to the capital."

Lanisi looked at her and said, "Night, what do you mean?"

The other elven girls also looked at her.

Carter sat on the bench and looked at him too.

Chu Xiaoye pondered for a moment before saying, "Lanisi, I think that Princess Carter's words make sense. If we leave this place, we will definitely encounter many difficulties on the way. I don't know when we can walk out of the Kingdom of Kast. Although the orcs here are not as interested in us elves as in the Bolton Kingdom, there will definitely be some orcs who will make things difficult for us. And the Holy City of the capital of Kast is about the same direction as our journey. If we follow Princess Carter, we will definitely be faster. At that time, if we set off from the Holy City with a fire dragon, we might be able to walk out of the Kingdom of Kast in a few days."

Vilis said rudely, "Stop pretending\! You're cheap\! You're craving her body\!"

Chu Xiaoye pretended not to hear and looked at the Queen. "Lanisi, think about it first. If you have any objections, we can discuss it."

Fei'er said weakly, "Your Majesty, I think what Lord Night said makes sense. We have only walked for a short distance and we have already encountered so many dangers and almost died. Orcs are so terrifying. If they see us, they will definitely not let us go."

Lanisi looked at Carter on it and said, "Princess Carter, what happened today was not within your expectations. Your previous efforts were almost wasted. How did we know that after we followed you into the Holy City, your battle with Lusni would be victorious? You previously said that Lusni controls a large number of troops and the army of the capital is under his control. To be honest, you might lose very badly when you return this time. You might even lose your freedom."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but praise the Queen. He said, "Carter, Her Majesty's worry is my worry. The Lusni family has been secretly running your country for so long. Can a teenage princess like you defeat them?"

Carter was silent for a moment before he said, "The army of the capital is not completely under the control of the Lusni family. My father is also guarding against them. Furthermore, our royal family controls the most important imperial guards. They don't dare to mess around."

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "Today, your five hundred imperial guards all betrayed you. Then, one day, the imperial guards of your palace might also betray you. Carter, my opinion is that you only need to send one person back with a letter to explain. You're a princess and a general guarding the border. You don't have to care about them, let alone return personally. It's safest to have an army in your hands. You're the safest here. If you return to the capital, you'll be a caged bird. No matter how powerful your wings are, you won't be able to fly out."

Carter looked at him and said, "If I don't go back, the Holy City will really become the territory of the Lusni family. I have to go back and take back the control of the Holy City from them."

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment and said, "You have killed the eldest and second young masters of the Lusni family. They will definitely not let the matter rest. Furthermore, the news that spread from here is that their eldest young master has committed treason and committed treason. This is a serious crime. Therefore, according to my guess, your father, the royal family, and the ministers who have a grudge against the Lusni family will definitely take the opportunity to deal with the Lusni family. At least, they will weaken their military authority. However, the Lusni family also knows that this is very disadvantageous to them. If they lose their military authority, they can only be trampled on. Therefore, they will definitely retaliate. Perhaps, when you return, your capital will be in chaos long ago. Both sides might even have started to risk their lives."

Carter looked at him with flickering eyes and said, "Night, what do you mean?"

Chu Xiaoye said, "My meaning is very simple. You can go back, but you can't go back alone to confront them. You have to bring your guards and army back."

Carter thought for a moment and said, "How many people should I bring?"

"All."

Chu Xiaoye said.

"All?"

Carter frowned and looked at him. "These troops are guarding the border. If I transfer and bring them to the capital, there will definitely be obstructions on the way. They might even think that I have rebelled and am preparing to attack the capital."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her flickering eyes and said, "Carter, this is a rare opportunity. If you still remember your dream. There is no war at the border now, and the army of the Bolton Kingdom has been transferred away. You left with the army and are ordered to return to the capital to help your father quell the rebellion. Who will stop you on the way? The ones who stop you are loyal to the Lusni family. You just have to swing the army and crush them. You are the princess of Kast and your father is the king of Kast. If you return to the capital with the king's orders, no one rules that you cannot bring the army."

"If my guess is right, your capital was already in chaos before you even set off. The messenger pigeons that will fly to all places will come one after another, and everyone is preparing to fight. Therefore, when you bring the army past those cities, the ministers guarding those cities have long known the situation in the capital. Those who are loyal to your royal family will naturally not make things difficult for you, and they will send the army with you. At that time, your army will become stronger and stronger. When you arrive at the capital, Princess Carter, at that time, it will be your cage to imprison others."

Carter stood up, and an excited red color rose on his face. "But, Night, what if you're wrong? What if the Lusni family did not rebel? And they surrendered directly?"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "You saw it today too. You know how the eldest young master of the Lusni family treated you. He planned to forcefully take you for himself and then prepared to kill you without hesitation. He would not be so bold alone. He must have the tacit approval and support of the family behind him. From this, it can be seen that the Lusni family had ill intentions long ago. When the news here reaches the capital, they will definitely take action, and your royal family will also take action. Don't worry. Even if the Lusni family surrender in the end, you will already be approaching with the army. At that time, if you want to continue being a princess and a general, you can enter the capital alone and apologize to your father. And if you're tired of being a princess, then…"

At this point, Chu Xiaoye suddenly stopped talking.

At this moment, he suddenly felt that he was like a terrifying conspirator, and a cold-blooded, heartless, and extremely cruel one at that.

It seemed that the blood flowing in his body was still the blood of the former lion.

Carter's body trembled slightly. It was not fear or fear, but excitement.

"Night, if you leave me, I'll cry my nose out and cry very miserably."

Princess Carter looked at him with shining eyes.

Chu Xiaoye knew that she had already made a decision.

"Don't worry, at least not now."

Now was not the time to leave, even if they were not related.

"Lanisi."

Princess Carter looked at the Elven Queen again and said solemnly, "Please come with me\! I guarantee that after I succeed, the Bolton Kingdom will never be able to harm you elves again\! Furthermore, I'm willing to give half of the kingdom of the Bolton Kingdom to you elves\!"

Chu Xiaoye felt that this girl was bragging too early.

It was good to have ambition, but he could not always be too confident in himself.

Now, he had yet to even settle the matters of his country and was actually thinking of occupying the Bolton Nation. This was too exaggerated.

Lanisi smiled faintly and said, "Princess Carter, we elves are not interested in the territory of others. We only want to live quietly in our own territory, not be disturbed or warred. That's enough."

Princess Carter said with a burning gaze, "Then I can promise you that after I take the Bolton Kingdom, no orcs will appear on the border that borders you, let alone have any designs on you\!"

Lanisi looked at the elf youth opposite her and could only say, "Thank you, Princess Carter. I've already said that Night is the leader of our team. Since he has already decided to help you, I have nothing to say."

Chu Xiaoye was rather touched and felt guilty.

He did have selfish motives for helping this Princess Carter. After all, she was once his lioness and now his woman. She was alone here. If he did not help her, who would?

"I have something to say\!"

The huge sword loli at the side stood up and looked at him coldly. "I'll ask you this. Is Lord Night a lover of Princess Carter?"

The tent immediately quietened down.

Carter did not answer. He looked at Chu Xiaoye and waited for his answer.

She did not care. It did not matter if she had a status.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a few seconds before saying honestly, "No. I have nothing to do with Princess Carter. I'm only related to that lioness named Alisa."

Vilis sneered and said, "Is it nothing? Then, what were you doing last night? Where did those nail marks and teeth marks on your body come from? Don't tell me that they were bitten and scratched by the lioness named Alisa\!"

Chu Xiaoye glared and said, "It's none of your business\! You're so talkative. Eat your meat\!"

Vilis mocked, "Angry from embarrassment? Don't dare to answer? Lord Night, I want to know who you're standing on and who you're speaking for. Are you an elf or an orc? Or a lion? Please tell me."

Chu Xiaoye stood up and looked at her seriously. "Alright, then I'll tell you. I'm a lion and an elf\! I'm standing on the lion's side and also on the elf's side. My decision will never hurt the interests of the elves, nor will I use your lives and the danger the elves are about to face to please others\! I can swear to the world and the Thunder God\! If there are any lies, I'll let my father be killed by the Thunder God and die without a complete corpse\! Lady Vilis, are you satisfied?"

Vilis was stunned for a moment before she said, "Why did you swear to bring your father along? Why didn't you die by the Thunder God and die without a complete corpse?"

Chu Xiaoye asked, "Lady Vilis, if your father is still alive. If one day, you and your father will face death at the same time, do you want to die yourself, or do you want your father to die?"

Vilis was silent for a moment before saying, "Naturally, I hope that my father lives."

"That's right."

Chu Xiaoye spread his hands and said, "I love my father. I definitely don't want my father to be killed by the Thunder God and die without a complete corpse. Therefore, I swear on him to show that I'm not lying."

Catherine, who was at the side, looked at him sideways.

On it, Carter endured his laughter.

"Alright."

Vilis sat down and said, "Then I'll believe you. However, if there's danger, I'll leave with Her Majesty immediately, regardless of whether you agree or not."

Chu Xiaoye said, "Agreed."

Since they had already finished talking and most of the food and wine had been eaten, it was time to leave.

Lanisi stood up and looked at him. "Night, tonight… Are you still staying?"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly got up and said, "Your Majesty, please let me serve you tonight."

He was finally afraid of Alisa, who had become an orc. If he stayed any longer, he could forget about sleeping tonight.

Lanisi smiled and extended her hand. "Let's go."

Chu Xiaoye had just walked over and was about to hold her hand when Carter suddenly said, "Lord Night, please wait. I still have some things to discuss with you. You said so much just now, and I think it's very good. Therefore, we have to have a long talk and plan carefully tonight. I hope that Lord Night will agree. I will definitely repay you in the future\!"

Chu Xiaoye trembled. He grabbed the Queen's hand and ran away\!
