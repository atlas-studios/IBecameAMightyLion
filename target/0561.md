Chapter 561: Couplets

The night was not dark.

The shore of the Qinhuai River was brightly lit.

Lanterns were hanging on both sides of the river, like two long dragons that illuminated the river and the two sides.

There were a few double-story boats docked in the river. On them, the music was flowing and the singing was mellow.

Both sides of the river were crowded and lively.

Other than the scholarly guests who had rushed over to participate in the gathering, there were also young men and women who liked to watch the fun and all sorts of peddlers shouting.

When Chu Xiaoye and the others came here, they were hearing the enthusiastic cheers of the riverside scholars and the beautiful sound of a piano flowing like water coming from the big boat in the river. It seemed that a certain talent had made a good poem and caused a commotion.

Chu Xiaoye looked at this lively scene and suddenly thought of the world outside and the world when he was a human.

This was ancient, but outside, it was a technologically advanced modern world.

If it was really like what Annie had said, the outside world was only a shadow or test subject of here, then the development of the test subject had clearly not succeeded.

The collapse of the world explained everything.

Perhaps, the faster they developed, the greater the destruction they would cause to the world. Then, the faster they would be destroyed.

When the moon was full, there would be losses and when the water was full, there would be overflowing. Nothing could always stay at the peak after reaching the peak and there would always be times when they fell.

The world here was equivalent to the ancient times of the outside world. It was still advancing step by step and developing slowly. No one knew what it would develop into in the end.

Perhaps the wheel of history would always move forward and no one could change it. In the end, it would still develop into the outside world.

Or perhaps, with the example of the outside world, the development here would completely change its original path under the lead of a certain ancient emperor and walk in a slower and longer direction.

"Sister\! Look, there are pairs over there\! There are many beautiful gifts\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was letting his imagination run wild, Little Guai pulled Qin Mo and squeezed towards a group of people with an excited expression.

"Little Guai, slow down\!"

Qin Yu hurriedly followed behind.

Qin Zhitan was helpless and could only follow. He smiled bitterly at Chu Xiaoye beside him and said, "These two girls like to join in the fun."

A young man in a long robe and looked like a cultured person was setting up a stall on the street by the river. It was filled with pairs and under the pairs were exquisite small gifts.

He wrote these pairs himself. Whoever could match them would obtain those small gifts.

This might be a losing deal. No matter what, he would not get a cent.

However, what scholars cared about was not money, especially when there was a poetry gathering not far away.

They only cared about their name.

The more people saw these pairs, the more beneficial it was to his reputation.

Using this gimmick to attract people, most of the people who were attracted were talented people. If the other party was good and talented, they could still make friends and have a wider future.

Not only did the eldest daughter of the Qin family, Qin Mo, like poems, she also liked couplets.

Therefore, when Little Guai saw this stall, she immediately pulled her over, wanting her to help her win a few beautiful gifts.

However, the easier targets had long been matched by the surrounding scholars. The remaining ones were more difficult.

Qin Mo frowned and looked at it for a while before shaking his head at the little girl, indicating that he was powerless.

Little Guai looked unhappy and said, "If only Brother was here. Brother dotes on Little Guai. He can definitely help Little Guai win these gifts."

When a young man beside her heard this, he could not help but laugh. He turned to look at her and said, "Little girl, is your brother really that powerful? Tell me and I'll see if I know him?"

The scholars surrounding the stall were thinking about the remaining few pairs.

This little girl suddenly said those words. Wasn't she saying that her big brother was stronger than all the scholars present?

Scholars were the proudest. They could not listen to others brag about being stronger in front of them. Unless that person had a reputation and was indeed very powerful, they admitted that they could not compare to him.

Therefore, the young man felt very unwilling to accept this.

The moment he spoke, the other young men beside him also looked over. Seeing that it was only a little girl, they said with a smile, "How can a child speak the truth? These couplets are not simple. Even if our four great talents are here, we will probably have to spend some effort. Brother Cai, let's think carefully. There's no need to make things difficult for children."

The young man named Cai Zheng smiled and ignored the girl beside him. He continued to look at the pairs.

Little Guai felt that she had been underestimated and said unhappily, "My brother is that powerful\! None of you can compare to him\!"

Qin Mo hurriedly patted her head and said, "Little Guai\! Stop talking nonsense\! Let's go\!"

The young men smiled and ignored them.

Little Guai's bad temper rose. She swung her hands and stomped her feet. "I won't leave\! Second Brother, call Big Brother over\! I want these small gifts\! Big Brother loves me the most. He can definitely help me win them\!"

The young stall owner smiled and picked up a small gift from a couplet. He handed it to her and smiled. "Little sister, take it. Go over and play. Don't disturb these brothers from thinking."

Although Little Guai was naughty and mischievous, she was very proud. She said, "No\! I want to win it fair and square. I don't want your charity\!"

The young men beside him frowned, looking a little impatient.

They were thinking about their children. This little girl had been crying here. It was annoying.

Qin Mo also saw the scholar's displeasure and immediately pulled her. "Little Guai\! Let's go\!"

Qin Yu also pulled her from the other side and said, "Sister, let's go. Second Brother will buy a few for you over there. Buy as many as you want\!"

Little Guai sat on the ground and cried out. She splashed water and said, "No\! No\! I want the gifts here\! I want the gifts here\!"

The young men turned their heads with disgust.

Qin Zhitan could only go forward and reprimand, "Little Guai\! If you're disobedient again, Father will beat you up\!"

Little Guai still sat on the ground and cried miserably. She was extremely sad and even hugged the table leg in front of her. No matter how Qin Mo and Qin Yu pulled, she refused to let go and get up.

The young men frowned and prepared to leave.

The young stall owner also had a helpless expression.

Just as Qin Zhitan's face was fierce and he was about to go up and forcefully carry her away, Chu Xiaoye suddenly said, "Little Guai, why don't Brother Chu help you fight these sons and win the gifts? We'll leave, okay?"

The moment that was said, Little Guai immediately stopped crying.

She turned her head and said with tears in her eyes, "Brother Chu is lying\! You won't be a pair\!"

The young men who were about to leave also stopped and looked over.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the few pairs hanging in front of the stall and the strange feeling in his heart could not dissipate for a long time.

He had actually seen these couplets before and remembered them.
