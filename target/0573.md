Chapter 573: The Mosquito

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine was very fast and no one could react\!

However, a light blue light suddenly appeared on this woman named Rosa and blocked Catherine's sharp claws\!

His silver claws grabbed the thin light screen and did not leave any marks.

Catherine landed on the ground, bared her fangs, and still growled.

Lanisi finally reacted and hurriedly blocked in front of Rosa. Her expression changed. "Catherine, what's wrong?"

Chu Xiaoye stared at the woman in front of him in bewilderment and said, "The scent on her body…"

Before he could finish, Rosa smiled bitterly and said, "It's not my scent, it's my teacher's scent. My teacher knew that she was here and asked me to bring her over."

Catherine seemed to understand something and calmed down.

Lanisi and the others were still a little stunned.

Chu Xiaoye held the sword at his waist and looked warily at the woman in front of him. "Lanisi, the High Priest Senna you're talking about might be the other Catherine in this world."

Lanisi was shocked. "How can that be?"

Rosa said with a serious expression, "It's not a possibility, it's true. When you entered the city, Teacher already knew. Let's go. Teacher doesn't have much time left. She won't do anything to you, I can guarantee it."

The woman looked at Catherine. Although her expression was serious, her attitude was very sincere.

Catherine turned around and looked at the king beside her, nodding.

Chu Xiaoye let go of the sword hilt and said, "Let's go together."

Rosa nodded and said, "Of course."

As she spoke, she turned around and led the way.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered as he approached Lanisi and asked in a low voice, "Is that High Priest Senna really about to die?"

If that was the case, there was no need for the other party to kill Catherine, because no matter what, she had to die.

Lanisi looked sad and nodded. "Night, don't worry. Senna won't hurt Catherine."

In a spacious but dark room, a woman in a black robe was lying there. Her hair was light blue and her face was pale. She looked not much older than Lanisi, but her blue eyes were filled with vicissitudes.

When Rosa brought them into the room, this former high priest did not look at Catherine but at Chu Xiaoye.

"Lions, elves, humans… How should I address you?"

The high priest looked at him deeply, as if he had seen through everything about him. Then, he smiled and said, "Just like Lanisi, I'll call you Night. Night, thank you for protecting the elves and saving the last bit of true elf blood."

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and looked at her in disbelief.

He had never told anyone about a human soul. Even he would sometimes forget it. How did this woman know?

"I know many things, so I can't live forever."

The high priest seemed to have seen the confusion in his heart and muttered. Then, he looked at Catherine and smiled. "I'm very happy to see you. I'm already satisfied to be able to see myself before I die. Catherine, you should be able to feel that you want to kill me and kill me with your own hands, right?"

Catherine looked at her in bewilderment, looking at a loss.

The high priest had a calm expression and said, "Even if I kill you, I won't be able to survive. Therefore, Catherine, please kill me. This way, I can coexist with you. You're a lion and an elf, like your king. You should want to, right?"

Catherine understood what she meant. Yes, she wanted to.

When the king could become an elf, when the king was talking and laughing with the female elves, and even when they were sleeping, she was thinking.

If she could also become an elf, her king should look at her more.

She liked the life of a lion and was unwilling to change this life, let alone become an elf. However, she had to follow the king and follow him forever.

Then, it was probably inconvenient to be a lion alone.

Just like that night in Suhang City, the king brought the elven girls and followed the people of the Qin family to play by the Qinhuai River. Because she was a lion, she could only hide in the residence and wait anxiously and sadly.

At that moment, she started to think about this question.

"Night, I want to remind you one last time."

Senna looked at the young man again and said, "Rosa will open the barrier and let you go out to find your companions. However, that world has completely changed now. If you go there, you might be involved in another war. In that world, you are a lion and a human. You might follow your heart and help them. However, the humans and animals there are suffering a destructive blow. Those monsters are not something you can resist. I hope you can maintain your consciousness."

Chu Xiaoye's expression changed and he said, "Will Earth be destroyed?"

Senna smiled. "Earth will never be destroyed. What is destroyed is only the current creatures. Soon, new creatures will be born. The wheels of history always move forward. Therefore, you can't stop them, even if you have to pay with your life."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but say, "Why are there those disasters?"

Senna's eyes revealed a deep light. "Perhaps Earth has activated its immune system and is cleaning the virus in its body. Or perhaps it's a natural era change. It's like flowers blooming and withering in every era."

"Virus?"

When Chu Xiaoye heard this word, those familiar scenes suddenly surfaced in his mind.

Trees fell one after another and the forest disappeared one after another.

Countless animals were killed and countless animals were extinct.

The mountains became flat ground, and the flat ground became tall buildings. Even the ground was dug out with big holes.

The sky was no longer blue, the ground was no longer green, the air started to stink, and the river water became muddy…

Even food became dangerous.

Earth was sick and could not take the burden anymore. Even its internal organs and blood were about to be hollowed out. Therefore, it decided to retaliate.

Chu Xiaoye's heart was heavy. He wanted to explain himself, but he could not find any words.

"Perhaps, this is just an experiment."

Senna suddenly said what he had once thought and muttered, "I hope that we here remember this terrifying experiment and love our world."

"Night."

The light in her eyes started to dim. "Do you still remember the mosquito?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he suddenly thought of the huge demon mosquito. "That mosquito…"

"Remember it."

The high priest only said these three words before looking at Catherine and saying with difficulty, "Come, while I'm still breathing, Catherine, attack. If you kill me, you'll be free."

Catherine narrowed her eyes.
