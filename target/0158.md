Chapter 158: The First Battle on the King's Path

The silver moon hung high in the sky.

The night wind was cool and felt quite comfortable when it blew on his body.

At this time, the camp of the cold father's pride was still more than 30 degrees warm.

As for Little Curly Tail and the others, their mouths should be open as they panted in the gradually withering bushes.

The harsh environment was tormenting them bitterly.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the vast and beautiful grassland in front of him.

This was the home of their pride.

He had to obtain territory as soon as possible and build his own kingdom and faction. Then, he would bring Little Curly Tail and the others over.

Tonight was the first night they came to this grassland.

The battle tonight was not only to save his face, but also to let him regain his confidence and fill him with confidence and hope for his future journey.

There was no personal grudge or old grievance. He only wanted to prove himself.

This territory was not considered vast, but the grass was lush and there were many bushes. Naturally, it attracted many herbivores.

Therefore, there was plenty of food and resources here.

Hence, this pride was also very strong.

At least, he had never seen so many strong lions on the grassland over there.

"Roar—"

The lion king's roar sounded in the distant grassland.

One after another, they continued endlessly.

The roars of the other two lions also rose and fell.

He was declaring his sovereignty and warning the nearby enemies\!

From their roars, the other lions could clearly know the number of lions in their tribe.

Sometimes, the female lions would roar too.

Even if there were more than twenty lions roaring together, their own kind could count their numbers by their voices. This was a very surprising thing.

Chu Xiaoye could accurately determine their location from the roars of the three lions.

This way, he could prevent himself from being surrounded by the three of them from the back like before.

The roars were getting closer and closer. Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and continued forward.

Soon, he saw the three lions lying together.

They might be three brothers and seemed to be very close. Be it walking or lying down, they were all together.

However, no matter how close brothers were, there were still levels in a pride.

No matter how many lions there were, there would only be one lion king in every pride.

Be it eating or mating, the Lion King took priority.

Chu Xiaoye recognized the lion king at a glance.

The lion king's mane looked even thicker and its color was deeper. It was probably the oldest, but it was at most in its prime and not old.

Its sharp and dignified gaze soon discovered him.

It immediately stood up.

The two brothers beside it also stood up.

Usually, when resisting external enemies, no matter how many enemies there were, the lion brothers would fight together.

However, this time, when they saw that the enemy who trespassed their territory was actually the cub from before again, their nervous expressions immediately relaxed.

However, they were still very angry.

They were not the only ones who were furious.

The thirteen female lions lying beside them were even more furious.

When they saw Chu Xiaoye, they all stood up, opened their mouths, and bared their fangs, roaring.

They still finished eating that prey.

However, as they ate, they vomited and finally ate what they spat out.

They hated him\!

They originally thought that this despicable kid had already been frightened by their king and did not dare to appear again.

Who knew that he would come again\!

Furthermore, he was so brazen\!

He was courting death\!

Usually, when lions fought, they would watch from the side and stay far away.

Now, they actually took the initiative to surround him.

They wanted to see this brat being torn to pieces by their king\!

"Roar—"

The lion king roared angrily and jogged over.

His two brothers followed behind unhurriedly, not preparing to attack.

Because they did not need to attack together to deal with a brat who smelled like milk.

They only had to watch.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly happy to see this scene.

If there was only one, he could use his speed and agility to dodge the other party's claws and pounce, then take the opportunity to counterattack.

The lion king roared and raised its upper body. It raised its two sharp claws and attacked him angrily\!

He could not let this slap hit him, or he would be paralyzed.

Chu Xiaoye immediately dodged to the right and quickly turned behind him, preparing to attack.

This lion king looked huge and heavy but its reaction speed was still extremely agile. It instantly turned around and faced him. It opened its mouth and bit at him.

Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry and started to circle it.

The lion king was furious and took the initiative to attack, but it always missed.

"Bam\!"

Finally, Chu Xiaoye seized the opportunity and slapped its butt, causing it to jump up from the ground and let out a fierce roar\!

"Roar—"

The lion king was furious, angry, and anxious. He looked flustered and exasperated as he pounced at him crazily.

However, Chu Xiaoye was extremely fast. Every time he pounced and bit, he would quickly turn around.

At this moment, under the lion king's furious pursuit, Chu Xiaoye ran towards the female lions.

The thirteen female lions stood there and looked at his agile speed in surprise, as well as his extraordinary courage and skills. They did not move at all.

Only when Chu Xiaoye suddenly slapped the butt of a female lion did the female lions react.

The lioness whose butt was slapped immediately jumped up in fright. She hurriedly opened her mouth to bite, but she bit nothing.

Chu Xiaoye quickly ran away and looked provocatively at the lion king.

He seemed to be saying, "Your Majesty, you won't blame me for teasing your wife in front of you, right?"

"Roar—"

The Lion King's roar indicated that not only would he blame him, he would also blame him very much\!

Damn it\!

The lion king's eyes spewed flames. He was about to explode in anger\!

Not only that, the female lion that Chu Xiaoye slapped also flew into a rage out of humiliation. She suddenly rushed out of the pride and chased after Chu Xiaoye with the lion king.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and started to circle the twelve female lions. He started to slap them non-stop\!

The twelve female lions were shocked and furious. They roared angrily and joined the hunting team\!

The remaining two lions were dumbfounded.

Unexpectedly, Chu Xiaoye suddenly became bold and ran towards them. Then, he suddenly jumped over their heads and humiliated the two brothers\!

"Roar—"

The two lions could not tolerate it anymore and joined the hunting team\!

As such, all the members of this pride had already been mobilized.

However, when Chu Xiaoye ran towards the distant forest, he realized that there were also a few female lions and a group of cubs standing outside the forest\!

They were watching curiously.

The number of members of this pride was actually so many\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the cubs. Most of them were a few months old and there were male and female cubs. They had good genes and were very strong and healthy.

When those little fellows saw him running over, none of them turned around to escape. They all opened their bright big eyes and watched excitedly.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flashed and he ran towards them.
