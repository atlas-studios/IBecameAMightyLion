Chapter 420: Untitled

"Ugh —"

The hyena queen fell to the ground and ignored the pain. She immediately started vomiting.

Seeing that the time was ripe, Belia, who was on the tree, immediately jumped down and opened her mouth to bite the hyena queen's neck\!

In the end, the black smoke and stench were still lingering in the hyena queen's fur.

"Ugh —"

Belia vomited on the hyena queen. Her body turned limp and she fell to the ground.

Fortunately, she had already developed some immunity to this stench. She hurriedly tilted her body and rolled to the side.

At this moment, the hyena queen's claws slapped the ground she had just landed on with a bang.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye rushed over.

The hyena queen held her breath and stopped vomiting. She raised her head and looked at him angrily, as if she had been humiliated\!

"Whoosh\!"

She attacked first and hit Chu Xiaoye with her head like a cannonball\!

Before Chu Xiaoye could raise his claws, he was sent flying. His body churned and he tasted sweetness in his throat. He spat out a mouthful of blood and fell heavily to the ground.

The hyena queen's gaze was cold as she rushed up again.

At this moment, Belia suddenly roared angrily and pounced over. Just as she pounced behind the hyena queen, the hyena queen suddenly turned around and slapped her open mouth.

Belia was sent flying. Her jaw was broken and her mouth was filled with blood.

Taking this opportunity, Chu Xiaoye got up from the ground. The intense pain in his body quickly disappeared under the impact of the strange heat.

When the hyena queen rushed up again, he did not take it head-on. Instead, he jumped onto a big tree at the side and avoided it first.

Unexpectedly, the hyena queen only looked up at him and ignored him. She turned around and rushed towards Belia.

This female hyena's intelligence was clearly very high.

Belia stood up with difficulty, her mouth full of blood. She could not close her mouth, but she did not show any weakness. She raised her claws and wanted to fight.

The hyena queen pushed her to the ground, opened her mouth full of fangs, and bit at her skull\!

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down from the tree. Golden light flashed and his sharp golden claws slashed at her head\!

The hyena queen seemed to have eyes on her head and suddenly dodged. She then suddenly jumped up and bit his raised front leg.

An intense pain suddenly assaulted him from his leg\!

Just as the hyena queen was about to close her teeth, Chu Xiaoye twisted his head and suddenly bit her head\!

At the same time, Belia, who was on the ground, suddenly jumped up and grabbed the hyena queen's abdomen.

The hyena queen made a prompt decision and immediately let go of her teeth to dodge Chu Xiaoye's fangs. Then, she slapped Belia's claws away and landed steadily on the ground, quickly jumping away.

There was also a piece of bloody flesh on her teeth.

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and looked down. A piece of flesh on his right front leg had been torn off and a burning pain came from his leg.

The hyena queen looked at him coldly and mockingly. She opened her mouth and swallowed the piece of flesh.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly rushed over from behind her. It was like an arrow that shot over and instantly arrived. It was so fast that even Chu Xiaoye did not see it clearly.

The hyena queen was shocked. She hurriedly fell to the right and rolled out\!

However, when she jumped up from the ground, she still felt a burning pain in her abdomen on the side. She turned around and saw a few deep claw marks on it. If she was just a second late, her stomach would have been cut open\!

The hyena queen still had a lingering fear. She raised her head and looked at the attacker who had suddenly arrived.

Catherine stood beside Chu Xiaoye, her stomach heaving violently and she was panting heavily. Her fur was messy and dripping with blood. She was not injured herself, but she was covered in the enemy's blood.

On the way back, they encountered another group of spotted hyenas.

Chu Xiaoye endured the pain and was about to ask about the safety of the other members when Little Curly Tail's roar suddenly came from the forest not far away.

They finally rushed back\!

Just as Little Curly Tail, who had rushed in front, was about to swing his tail and rush over to help, Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and told them to go to Blue Eyes and the others to help.

The Jiela sisters brought the six female lions and roared as they rushed towards the spotted hyenas.

Before the hyenas that were attacking the cold father and Aisha could react, they were slapped away by Little Curly Tail's tail. Their ribs broke and they fell to the ground.

"Roar—"

Mei Mei roared angrily and rushed to her mother's side.

Although Xi'er, who was blind in one eye, was covered in wounds, she was still very strong. The corpses of hyenas were all around her.

Seeing that the situation over there was clear, Chu Xiaoye looked at the hyena queen in front of him again.

Both sides seemed to be taking every second to rest and recover.

The hyena queen looked over and saw that her subordinates were already retreating in defeat. The battle had turned around and the few most powerful female hyenas were either dead or injured. She immediately had the intention to retreat.

Just as she opened her mouth and was about to order the remaining hyenas to retreat, the thick leaves on the ground only a meter away from her suddenly flew up with a whoosh. Then, a figure pounced at her at lightning speed\!

No matter how strong she was or how agile her reaction was, it was difficult to dodge at this distance\!

Before the hyena queen could react, the sharp claw pierced into her neck with a whoosh\!

Just as the sharp claw was about to cut off her neck, the hyena queen suddenly roared and flipped to the ground. Her two front legs suddenly flicked forward and kicked the attacker heavily. The hyena queen also used this strength to break free of the sharp claw and slide out on the ground.

However, the flesh from her neck to half of her body was all torn off\!

The hyena queen jumped up from the ground, and her limbs turned limp from the pain. She almost fell down again and looked angrily at the attacker hiding underground.

It was an extremely young lioness. She was small and about the size of Catherine.

At this moment, there was a big piece of bloody flesh hanging on her claws. When the hyena queen looked over, the female lion suddenly opened her mouth and placed the piece of fur-covered flesh in her mouth. She casually chewed a few times and swallowed it\!

This scene frightened not only the hyena queen.

Chu Xiaoye, who was at the side, was also shocked.

This young lioness was the lioness he had saved previously. No one expected her to be so strong and look so fierce\!

The hyena queen was in pain, fright, and anger. She looked at the attacker in bewilderment. Her limbs were a little limp and the intention to retreat grew stronger.

Alisa licked the blood at the corner of her mouth and did not rush over again. Instead, she stood there and looked at her coldly, blocking her path.

"Could this be the true king of this pride?"

At this moment, the hyena queen started to doubt her previous judgment.

The more calm and indifferent Alisa appeared, the more afraid and afraid this hyena queen was. The confidence in her heart suddenly disappeared.

She turned her head and looked in other directions, as if she was looking for an escape route again.

Chu Xiaoye sighed inwardly. This lioness's intelligence seemed to be higher than he thought. She immediately frightened the hyena queen.

Originally, with this hyena queen's strength, even if the three of them added up, they might not be able to defeat her. But now, the situation had suddenly changed.

The hyena queen's heart had already started to become timid and fearless. She no longer had her previous fighting spirit. If she fought again, her first thought would be to escape or avoid being injured, not to try her best to defeat or kill the other party.

Her combat strength was already greatly reduced.

Alisa stood there motionless, but she gave the hyena queen a lot of pressure.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he could not wait anymore.

"Whoosh\!"

He rushed up.

Catherine followed closely, like a shadow dragged behind him.

Golden claws and silver claws lit up in the hyena queen's eyes.

The hyena queen did not fight. Instead, she suddenly fled towards the forest at the side. In the end, her two front legs suddenly fell into a pit and she fell to the ground.

There was no cover on this pit and ordinary animals could dodge when running.

But now, the hyena queen was already terrified. She only thought of escaping into the forest and did not pay attention to her feet.

The moment she fell to the ground, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine had already pounced forward. They raised their sharp claws and prepared to give the hyena a fatal blow.

However, this hyena queen was really strong. Before she could jump up from the hole, she raised her hind legs and stood on the ground like she had fallen flat. With a bang, she sent Chu Xiaoye flying.

"Chi\!"

Catherine's claws pierced into her body. Just as she was about to cut her stomach, she suddenly hesitated. She raised her other claw and cut off the spine on the female hyena's back\!

The claw that had pierced into her stomach quickly retracted and did not open the hyena queen's stomach.

The hyena queen let out a miserable scream and fell to the ground.

Catherine stood at the side and turned to look at her king. Her limbs turned limp and she lay on the ground, looking exhausted and weak.

The muscles at the corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched and he wanted to slap her.

With such poor acting skills, she still dared to embarrass herself in front of him?

Although he was the lion king of this pride, there was no need to become a hero every time he fought.

The female cub clearly wanted to give him this honor and battle credit.

However, he did not need it at all.

"Ahhh —"

The hyena queen let out a miserable scream. Her broken spine was healing at a visible speed\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly pounced forward and crushed her head with his claws, ending her completely.

Then, he placed his golden claws in the hyena queen's wound and started to absorb her skill that made her bones heal quickly.

At the same time, a strange heat flowed into his body through the blood.

Catherine lay at the side and tilted her head, looking at him with her dark eyes. Seeing his grin and happy expression, she could not help but grin.
