Chapter 453: Untitled

"Come, nourish yourself\!"

Chu Xiaoye seemed to see the pride and ridicule that humiliated him in the lioness's gaze.

This was like a bad person who had succeeded and was humiliating a pitiful victim\!

At this moment, the victim should be curled up, trembling, crying bitterly, or hiding her face and escaping in shame.

Perhaps this was what this lioness wanted to see.

Unfortunately, Chu Xiaoye's skin was not human skin now.

He raised his head and stuck out his chest, looking down at the female lion like a king. His expression was arrogant as he raised his chin and instructed as if he was ordering a servant, "Bring it up and serve me dinner\!"

Alisa was stunned for a moment. She narrowed her eyes and stared at him with a burning gaze.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye flicked his sharp golden claws and narrowed his eyes. His sharp gaze was filled with threat. "If you don't listen to my orders, scram\! This pride and this territory donâ€™t welcome you\!"

He should be ruthless and show his true colors\!

As for not admitting it after eating it and abandoning it after doing so, Little Tian Tian and Madam Niu did not exist for animals.

As the king of the pride, he still had to have this dominance and coldness.

Alisa raised her head and narrowed her eyes, looking at him with a gaze as sharp as a knife. Sparks flew and blades flashed between their eyes\!

The atmosphere gradually froze and the battle was about to start\!

This lion and lioness, who had just been intimate for the night, were now opposing each other with a murderous aura\!

Suddenly, Catherine walked out of the tree hole on the other side and looked down coldly.

Alisa immediately sensed another killing intent coming from the side. She turned around and happened to meet those dark and cold eyes.

She could not even win in a one-on-one battle, let alone one-on-two.

Alisa suddenly loosened her teeth and threw the prey in her mouth to the ground. She looked at Chu Xiaoye mockingly and turned to leave.

This was also a compromise.

However, her last gaze seemed to be mocking this young lion king. It was always eating soft rice and always relying on the help of other female lions.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not care.

What was wrong with being a freeloader?

Being able to freeload meant that he was capable\!

Many animals, including humans, did not have the ability to freeload even if they wanted to.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and walked towards the prey. The grievance and depression in his heart eased a little.

He had won this round.

Since there was a start, he had plenty of ways to wash away the humiliation last night in the future\!

Chu Xiaoye picked up the prey and prepared to climb up his tree hole to enjoy it. However, he remembered that when he ate later, blood would be everywhere. It was not too good. After all, it was his place to sleep.

He raised his head and looked at Catherine. His heart skipped a beat as he jumped onto the tree root and climbed up. He placed the prey in front of Catherine and invited her to enjoy it warmly.

As long as he did not dirty his sleeping place, the female cub would not care.

Catherine did not know his true thoughts. Seeing that he had taken the initiative to invite her to eat with him, all the frustration and sadness in her heart instantly disappeared.

However, she still abided by her duties and was unwilling to break the rules. She took the initiative to retreat to the side and lowered her head to refuse.

If there was only one prey, she would only enjoy it when he was full.

Chu Xiaoye knew how stubborn she was and did not force her. Instead, he tore off a thigh and threw it in front of her.

The thigh of this prey naturally made Catherine recall the scenes from her childhood.

Her eyes trembled as she lowered her head and bit the thigh gently, her heart filled with warmth.

"King, Annie is hungry too."

Just as Chu Xiaoye was burying his head and eating meat, the little girl, who was standing at the entrance of his house, could not help but shout.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her. He originally wanted to ignore her, but his heart suddenly softened under her beautiful eyes. He could not help but raise his claws and hook them. "Then come over."

There was suddenly a magical charm on this little girl. It was like magic that could not be seen or touched but could be clearly felt.

Until now, he finally understood why the big black bear would listen to this little girl.

Some things seemed to be innate.

The little girl climbed down the ladder and carried the ladder to the root. After placing it steadily, she carefully climbed up.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in surprise, then at the ladder he had personally made. Perhaps this ladder was not too heavy for him, but to this delicate little girl, it was not so easy to move.

However, just now, this little girl had easily lifted this ladder, walked violently for a while, and placed it here.

It seemed that not only was there something strange on this human little girl, she had also become much stronger. She was no longer the delicate body she had when she first entered the pride.

"Thank you, King."

The little girl climbed up, her eyes curved, and she smiled sweetly at him. Then, she took out the sharp knife from her waist and sat opposite him, starting to cut the black antelope on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her curiously.

The little girl cut off a piece of meat covered in blood and placed it in her mouth. She narrowed her eyes and chewed it very happily. She was no longer afraid of the smell and swallowed it directly. She tasted it very carefully, as if she was enjoying the delicacies of humans. Then, she swallowed it.

"It's so sweet."

The little girl smiled happily at him and impatiently cut another piece and sent it into her little mouth.

Such bloody raw meat was actually so sweet?

Chu Xiaoye was surprised and lowered his head to eat a few more bites. How was it sweet? It was clearly very fishy and fragrant, okay?

The little girl's appetite was still very small. After eating a few pieces, she patted her stomach to show that she was full.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and lowered his head to bite and eat with relish.

Soon, only its internal organs and head were left.

However, there were still many pieces of meat on the skeleton.

The little girl carefully scraped it off with a knife and placed it in the horns she carried with her, preparing to use it for dinner.

Looking at her figure retreating carefully from the ladder, Chu Xiaoye's emotions were rather complicated. He had become a lion and thought that he would never have fate with humans in his life. However, there was an additional human in the pride, and she was his subordinate. Her life and death were in his hands.

It seemed that his fate with humans had not been severed.

No one knew what was happening in the human world at this moment.

At noon, Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur returned with the team.

However, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly had yet to return.

Until evening, they still did not see their figures.

Seeing that the sun was about to set, Chu Xiaoye did not continue to wait. He immediately brought Catherine out to search.

Alisa hesitated for a moment and followed behind.

The fiery red setting sun was blocked by the dense leaves. On the tree trunk of the towering tree, there was a black shadow as thick as a python shaking its antennae and slowly crawling down.

The big black bear brought back a few fresh fish from the river.

The little girl was squatting on the ground, concentrating on using a knife to break the fish. Then, she hung it above the tree hole to dry, waiting to eat when she was hungry.

The big black bear lay obediently beside her, its nostrils smelling the strange fragrance from her body. Its eyes were lowered and its expression was intoxicated, its face filled with happiness and piety.
