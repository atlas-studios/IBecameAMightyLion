Chapter 500: Princess Lanisi

"Ah —"

A miserable and desperate scream came from the Queen's mouth.

She suddenly got up and pounced at her son.

The prince's headless corpse was still standing there and had yet to fall.

The queen knelt on the ground and screamed as she pulled him into her arms, letting the blood that sprayed out like a spring stain her noble and beautiful body.

"Beast\! How dare you\!"

The two guards standing behind the prince only reacted at this moment. They hurriedly roared angrily and pulled out the long sword at their waists\!

However, just as their swords were pulled out of their sheaths, another figure suddenly pounced over at lightning speed. With a whoosh, it pierced into the throat of one of the guards and pulled down, dissecting the entire chest of the guard\!

Blood sprayed and internal organs were all over the ground\!

He widened his eyes and fell to the ground.

Another guard raised the sword in his hand in fear.

However, before the sword could land, the golden light that cut the prince's head off reappeared\!

His head followed the prince's head and flew out of the stone house, landing in the arena on the ground—the land that was covered in the blood of slaves and beasts and brought countless laughter and excitement to them.

Chu Xiaoye was still standing on the stone table full of exquisite snacks. He raised his head and stuck out his chest as he looked at them, just like how he used to look at the animals on the grassland.

He was still a king\!

Catherine landed on the ground, looking like she had once followed him through life and death without fear.

This sudden change stunned everyone in the stone house.

The Queen hugged her headless son and roared hysterically, "Vilis\! You bitch\! Quickly tear these two animals into pieces\!"

Vilis woke up from her shock and slowly loosened her clenched fists. She looked at her queen coldly and whispered, "Sorry, Your Majesty, I don't have a sword."

Her sword had already been taken away before she came up to see the Queen.

She indeed did not have a sword.

"Trash\!"

The Queen suddenly turned around and looked at the two guards behind her. She roared angrily, "Kill these two animals\! Kill them\!"

The surroundings were in chaos and the palace guards rushed over.

Viscount Lori and Viscount Boren hurriedly pulled out the long swords at their waists, but their hands were trembling and they did not dare to move forward.

They had already seen the speed and terrifying strength of these two lions with their own eyes.

"Come\! Come quickly\! Protect the Queen\! Kill these two animals\!"

They could only protect the Queen and shout.

Densely packed palace guards rushed over, but the passageway into this stone house was not wide. There were already many people in the stone house.

The guards with swords and swords could not enter at all.

Vilis and Annie stood at the door and did not move to make way.

The one blocking the passageway was the big black bear, Tibbs.

The guards held their weapons and shouted. They did not know if this big black bear was friend or foe. For a moment, they were actually blocked there.

The Queen hugged her son tightly and roared angrily, "Kill them\! Kill them\!"

Viscount Lori, who was holding a walking stick in one hand and a sword in the other, could only turn around and look at Denise, the sharpshooter beside the Queen. He shouted angrily, "Shoot\! Quickly shoot\! Shoot these two animals to death\!"

Denise ignored him.

She only listened to the Queen's orders.

The Queen suddenly turned around and cursed angrily, "Denise\! You stupid mute\! What are you waiting for\! Take out your arrows and shoot these two animals to death\!"

Denise pulled the bowstring with her eyes like ice.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Two sharp arrows flew out at the same time and pierced into the throats of Viscount Lori and Viscount Boren with a puff.

"Clang\!"

The sword in Viscount Lori's hand fell to the ground. He raised his hand and covered his throat, his eyes wide with disbelief.

As for Viscount Boren, his body tilted and he fell to the ground, starting to twist in pain.

The Queen suddenly got up and turned around, looking at the mute girl in front of her with a pale face.

The mute girl suddenly spoke. "Your Majesty, I have already listened to your orders and shot these two animals to death."

Her voice was actually soft and pleasant to the ear.

The Queen's lips trembled and her eyelids twitched, as if she suddenly thought of something.

Denise looked at her calmly and said softly, "You killed my parents to nurture a cold-blooded and heartless killer, right?"

The Queen's body trembled. She wanted to deny it, but she still maintained her status and could not put down her dignity to speak.

Wasn't opening her mouth equivalent to begging for mercy?

She suddenly thought of a more terrifying possibility\!

She suddenly looked at the tall and beautiful red-haired girl behind Denise—her daughter, Lanisi.

She had only inadvertently told someone about this\!

"Lanisi…"

She shook her head in disbelief.

The palace guards outside the stone house stopped there and no longer surged forward. It was terrifyingly quiet.

A few guards walked out of the crowd and stood at the front. They were all tall girls.

They held the sword hilts at their waists and looked over coldly, as if they had no intention of charging over to protect Her Majesty.

The Queen was trembling, shaking her head in fear and disbelief.

"William, he's your younger brother\!"

The Queen said with tears all over her face.

Lanisi narrowed her long and determined eyes and looked at the bald lion on the stone table. She was silent for a few seconds before saying, "This is not my order."

The queen's eyes lit up. She suddenly pointed at the lion on the stone table and screamed, "Then kill it\! Kill this animal and take revenge for your brother\!"

Lanisi tightened her grip on the sword at her waist.

The queen suddenly looked at her and grinned hideously. "Lanisi, your younger brother is already dead. In the future, you will be the crown princess of our elf race. You are my daughter and the queen will always love you. Kill it\! Kill these two animals\! This elf race is yours\!"

"Clang\!"

Lanisi pulled out the sword at her waist and looked coldly at the lion on the stone table.

Her red hair danced and her aura was outstanding. The sword in her hand reflected her beautiful and slightly inexperienced face. Her blue eyes flickered with a terrifying light.

She held her sword and slowly walked past the Queen. The sword in her hand suddenly pierced back and pierced into the Queen's chest—her biological mother\!

The smile on the Queen's face and the madness in her eyes suddenly stiffened.

Her mouth was open and her lips were trembling. She lowered her head and looked in disbelief at the sword that had pierced into her body. This was her birthday gift to her when she was fourteen.

"Lanisi…"

She slowly raised her head and looked at her daughter in pain, her tears flowing uncontrollably.

Lanisi turned her back and did not turn around or look back, only leaving her with a cold and heartless back.

"Mother, I have to do this."

She muttered.
