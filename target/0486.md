Chapter 486: Elves

Kill myself?

Then, how should I find him?

What did I look like here?

If I was killed here, would the current me immediately disappear?

After all, my true body no longer existed.

Just like the flower in the mirror, the moon in the water, without my main body, I would become blank and cease to exist.

At that moment, Chu Xiaoye's mind was in chaos, and all he could think of was this question.

He felt like he was dreaming.

Perhaps after waking up from his dream, he would still be a young lion king. He would still sleep in the cave at the bottom of the tree and work with the pride, eating and waiting for death.

"Since we're here, that means that from now on, we're all real. Even if the version of us here is killed, the current us will still live well and will become the only true existence."

"How should we find ourselves here? It's very simple. Wait. When you suddenly discover that your shadow has disappeared, you will definitely be very afraid and anxious. You will think of ways to find yourself everywhere. Here, they are sharper and more panicked than us. They will find us and kill us at all costs. Therefore, you don't have to worry about not being able to find them. Just wait patiently. Wait for them to appear. Then, discover them first and kill them\!"

The little girl seemed to know how to read his mind and answered all the questions in his heart.

"As for what I look like here."

The little girl smiled mysteriously and said, "Tibbs and I should be in our current appearances and won't change much. As for you, that's not necessarily true. Perhaps you'll still be lions, or perhaps you'll become other animals, or perhaps you'll be a human or orc, or even a dragon. However, as long as you kill them, you can fuse with them and become their appearance, or you can maintain your current appearance. Every one of them is real."

The information was too much for Chu Xiaoye to digest.

The little girl walked in front of him and leaned close to him. She raised her little face and said, "King, no matter how you change, you will always be Annie's king. You saved Annie's life. You were the one who protected Annie from being hurt. Annie will always remember."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her pure and deep eyes and was stunned. Just as he was about to ask about something else, a snow-white little bird suddenly flew out of the forest and floated in front of them. It actually said in human language, "Lady Annie, welcome home. Everyone is waiting for you."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the little bird in shock.

Annie turned her head and smiled at the bird. "Alright, Vilis."

The little bird flapped its wings and turned to lead the way.

Annie climbed onto the big black bear's back and explained to Chu Xiaoye, "This is a bird raised by Vilis. It can help her send letters and mimic her voice, but it can only say a few words at most. Vilis is the chief swordmaster of our family. She's very tall and mighty. You have to be polite to her later."

"Family? Swordmaster?"

Chu Xiaoye was confused when he heard this. He moved his feet and followed behind her mechanically.

He could not think anymore.

What he saw and heard had already exceeded his understanding.

He needed to calm down and sort things out.

After passing through the ancient snow forest, a 100,000-foot cliff suddenly appeared in front of him.

The other side of the cliff was covered in fog and could not be seen clearly. In the middle was an exquisite ice bridge that seemed to be condensed from ice. It flickered with a light blue light and was extremely beautiful.

The white bird flew into the sky and disappeared.

Annie rode the big black bear and stepped onto the ice bridge.

Chu Xiaoye was about to use his skill to see the scene opposite the cliff through the fog when the little girl suddenly turned around and said, "King, aren't you surprised that I know all this and why I came here?"

Of course Chu Xiaoye was puzzled.

However, he had too many strange things now and did not know where to ask.

He and Catherine also stepped onto the ice bridge.

The little girl rode the big black bear and walked slowly in front. She looked ahead with a complicated gaze and muttered, "In the end, the current me is only a shadow. Unless she dies…"

The little girl turned around to look at him again and said with a smile, "King, let me tell you. She betrayed her family and left with many of their secrets. No one knows where she is. Therefore, they found me and spent a lot of effort to make me return and replace her identity while also trying to lure her out and kill her."

"Therefore, this is my home, and not mine. I'm afraid I won't be liked here."

The little girl revealed a self-deprecating smile, but her eyes flickered with determination. She said with a determined expression, "I'll work hard\! I'll work hard to prove that I'm not just an illusory shadow\! King, you have to work hard too."

The big black bear quickened its steps.

Soon, they arrived at the other side of the cliff.

The fog started to dissipate.

The scene in front of him gradually became clear.

A fragrance of flowers assaulted him, bringing with it a warm wind that he had not felt for a long time.

Chu Xiaoye saw grass, flowers, houses, and what looked like an ancient and beautiful castle.

At the bridge stood a silver-haired girl who was even shorter than a little girl.

She was carrying a seven-foot long and very wide "giant" sword on her shoulder. It formed a sharp contrast to her small and delicate figure and looked very strange and comical.

She was wearing silver armor and had an exquisite medal on her chest. She had a pair of blue eyes that were as beautiful as Annie's. Her waterfall-like silver hair hung to the roots of her thighs, and her gaze was cold and her expression was serious.

At the same time, she revealed a pair of sharp ears.

Annie jumped down from the big black bear's back and walked in front of the girl. After hesitating for a moment, she raised her hand and rubbed the other party's head. She smiled and said, "Vilis, thank you."

Vilis did not laugh or get angry.

She looked past Annie and at Chu Xiaoye and Catherine behind her.

Annie turned around and blinked playfully at Chu Xiaoye, as if she was saying, "Right? I told you she was tall and mighty."

If this little fellow could be called tall and mighty, then she was naturally even taller and more mighty.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and continued to size up the strange little creature in front of him.

They looked like humans, but they did not feel like humans. They were much purer than humans.

"Vilis, let me introduce you."

Annie familiarly pulled Vilis' other hand and prepared to introduce Chu Xiaoye and Catherine to her.

However, before she could speak, Vilis said coldly, "Lady Annie, our tribe does not welcome any visitors, and we will not welcome any guests. Let them leave."

The words that Annie had yet to say were stuck in her throat.

She suddenly pointed at the big black bear and said, "What about Tibbs?"

Vilis looked at the big black bear and said, "It's your mount and slave. It has signed a soul contract with you, so it can naturally come in."

Annie frowned and said, "Vilis, they just came here and can't even tell the direction. If you don't let them in, they have nowhere to go and will die."

Vilis turned around coldly and said, "It has nothing to do with me."

Annie shook her little hand and begged, "Vilis, can't you make an exception?"

Vilis stopped talking and prepared to leave.

Annie hurriedly hugged her arm and raised her voice. "Vilis, what if they're willing to sign a soul contract with our companions and become their mounts, or pets and war beasts?"

Vilis paused and stopped. She was silent for a moment before saying, "That can be done."

Annie hurriedly turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye, blinking hard at him.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and turned around, preparing to leave.

The reason why he came here was to seek a more exciting lion life and higher ideals. How could he degrade himself and become someone else's mount and slave?

No matter what, he was a lion king, a lion king with dignity and pride\!

Annie hurriedly said, "King, do you know what the orc called out when it saw me previously? It called me an elf. What a beautiful elf\! I'm an elf, and so is Vilis. All the elves live here. Do you know what elves are? Elves can let your body be reborn and become stronger and stronger. They can even let you live as long as they do. Stay and sign a soul contract. You don't have to be their mount. You can also become friends, or even… partners or masters."

Chu Xiaoye stopped.

Just as Annie was secretly blinking at Vilis, Chu Xiaoye suddenly quickened his steps and left with Catherine.

The smile on Annie's face froze.

Until Chu Xiaoye and Catherine's backs disappeared from the ice bridge, the silver-haired Vilis suddenly turned around and looked angrily at the little girl beside her. She stomped her feet and said, "Lady Annie, you promised me that you would bring back the most powerful lion as my mount\!"

Annie shrugged and said, "You saw it too. I did bring it back for you. However, your charm and strength clearly did not move him."

"I don't want to move that bald lion\! I want to capture him\! Look, no one can escape Lady Alice's long legs\!"

Vilis suddenly moved her short legs and ran with the huge sword on her shoulder. Soon, she ran across the ice bridge and chased after him.
