Chapter 61: Instinct and Humanity

The sky finally turned dark.

Catherine lay in the bushes and waited for the stars and the moon. Finally, the sky turned dark.

She had fallen asleep accidentally last night and did not see his heroic figure when hunting.

Tonight, she would open her eyes wide and stare at him meticulously, never taking her gaze away from him\!

The three female lions went out to hunt.

The pregnant Callie and Maya were sleeping.

Chu Xiaoye climbed onto another Baobab tree and used his sharp claws to dig for soft and humid wood slag on the thick branches.

He could clearly see the water inside.

With a gentle squeeze, clear water flowed out of the wooden slag that was dug out.

It seemed that there was no need to try again.

The two Baobab trees did store a lot of water, enough for the pride to survive the most difficult dry season.

He filled the hole with the wooden dregs he had dug out again to prevent the water from evaporating.

The animals and plants that could survive until now in this grassland had naturally gone through all sorts of cruel tests of nature. They slowly evolved and changed until they were truly accustomed to the bad situation here.

This Baobab tree should have started to store water in advance during the rainy season.

The problem of water sources had been resolved.

Chu Xiaoye prepared to go down and bring Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to the bushes at the back to take a look.

At this moment, he suddenly saw a familiar figure appear on the hill not far away from him\!

Under the cover of the night, his strong and huge body, lush mane, and dark and cold eyes quietly came with a murderous aura\!

It was the wandering lion that had escaped in the evening\!

"Roar—"

He immediately roared from the tree and issued an alarm\!

Callie and Maya, who were lying in the bushes, hurriedly stood up and walked forward. They raised their necks and looked up the hill.

At this moment, the wandering lion had already started running towards them\!

Its fangs were bared and its mane fluttered\!

Those fierce and cold eyes were filled with cold killing intent and hatred\!

Callie and Maya panicked when they saw this scene. They growled and turned to escape\!

However, they hesitated for a moment. They did not know if they were worried about the cubs or if they thought of the fact that wandering lions generally did not hurt female lions. They stopped in their tracks and hurriedly called out to the four young cubs to let them escape\!

Lars jumped up from the bushes with a whoosh and turned to flee into the bushes at the back. He left in a hurry.

Under Chu Xiaoye's call, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei climbed up the Baobab tree and stood with him.

A lion was massive and it was difficult to climb up.

Catherine hesitated, not knowing if she should run away like Lars or climb up the Baobab tree.

She had always thought that the two trees belonged to the three of them and that she was not qualified to go up.

Just as she was hesitating, the wandering lion had already rushed over with a murderous aura.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and called out to her anxiously.

This idiot\!

Why was she still in a daze at a time like this\!

Come up quickly\!

When Catherine heard his call, she was overjoyed and excited. She did not hesitate anymore and immediately rushed under the Baobab tree and climbed up agilely\!

She lowered her head and quietly walked to another branch. She did not dare to stand too close to him and stood behind him, looking at him happily.

She finally stood on the same tree as him.

Furthermore, he had invited her.

At this moment, she actually did not have any fear in her heart and was even in the mood to let her imagination run wild.

"Roar—"

The wandering lion roared angrily and pounced at the two female lions. Its bloody mouth and sharp fangs were filled with extreme anger and killing intent. It did not have the intention to be protective of the fairer sex\!

Callie and Maya were frightened. They hurriedly roared and opened their mouths to resist\!

At this moment, it was already too late to escape, and he could not have his back facing this wandering lion\!

As long as he bit his neck and pressed him to the ground, he would never be able to stand up again\!

The two pregnant female lions' faces were soon covered in blood and wounds\!

Even if they were not pregnant, they were definitely not a match for this lion that was nearly 200 kilograms\!

The lion's body size and strength, as well as the combat genes it had since birth, were definitely not something that any lioness could compare to\!

This wandering lion clearly had killing intent. Every move was fatal and merciless\!

Callie and Maya were regretful and terrified. They roared in despair and struggled helplessly\!

The wandering lion suddenly slapped Callie's face, causing her to fall to the ground. Then, it pounced ferociously, preparing to bite her throat\!

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, an angry roar suddenly came from the Baobab tree\!

The wandering lion paused and raised its head to look at the Baobab tree.

On the tree, Chu Xiaoye bared his fangs with a provocative gaze.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately let out roars and looked at him without fear\!

The wandering lion roared angrily and immediately recognized the three of them.

When he fought with the cold father in the evening, it was these three despicable little fellows who overestimated their abilities and wanted to challenge him. In the end, their mothers were drawn out.

That was why he fled\!

He was going to start a massacre tonight\!

Whether it was the lionesses or the cubs, he would never let them go\!

He wanted to make all bastards who did not follow the rules pay the most terrible price\!

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and continued to pounce on the two female lions\!

He needed to kill these two pregnant female lions first and make their children die in their wombs\!

The injured Callie was slapped to the ground again\!

The wandering lion was about to pounce on her when Maya suddenly pounced on him from behind, roaring and biting him\!

The wandering lion immediately turned around to deal with her\!

Callie hurriedly took this opportunity to get up from the ground. Without any hesitation, she turned around and ran into the bushes at the back, abandoning her sister, who had been bitten by the lion to save her.

She was already more than two months pregnant and her stomach was already bulging. She would be giving birth in a month.

She had already lost two children and did not want to lose them again.

Furthermore, she wanted to live.

Callie had escaped.

Maya's situation immediately became even more dangerous.

The wandering lion's attacks were like a torrential rain that she could not resist at all, let alone escape\!

She was about to fall.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down from the tree and charged towards the wandering lion\!

He was very afraid.

If he was not afraid on the tree, he would definitely be afraid on the ground.

He was not even a year old and was not as big as a lioness. How could he resist this strong and huge monster?

He had no combat experience with lions.

Furthermore, the blood of a young cub flowed in his bones, and he was instinctively afraid of adult lions.

Just like Lars, who ran away without hesitation.

Indeed, after training, he was already very fast and strong. His claws and teeth were very sharp, but that was only relative to hyenas and other prey.

The competition between animals mainly relied on their size and strength to bite.

In the face of absolute strength, any fancy skills might only increase his chances of survival, but they could not be too useful in a face-to-face battle.

Just like a ferocious and terrifying crocodile, no matter how terrifying other animals were, they had to obediently submit to a larger and more powerful hippopotamus.

With his current body size and bite strength, he would definitely not be able to defeat this lion that was in its prime.

He was not strong enough.

He did not want to die.

Hence, he stood on the tree and was hesitant.

His animal instincts made him think of only himself first.

For example, Callie.

However, when he heard Maya's desperate roar and terrified eyes and thought of her daughter, Gigi, dying tragically in front of him, he finally overcame his instinctive fear and rushed down the tree\!

He jumped up high and fell from the tree like a bolt of lightning, pouncing on the wandering lion that was biting Maya\!

He looked so determined\!

The bright moonlight fell and shone on his fierce and ferocious face.

Those amber eyes shone with charming light.

Catherine stood on the tree and looked at him in a daze.
