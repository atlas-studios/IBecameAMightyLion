Chapter 234: The Cute Little Lioness

Tilly was injured.

However, the white tiger was not having a good time either.

They were still fighting on the snow and on the tree.

A large patch of trees fell to the ground.

Broken branches, fallen leaves, and torn bark were everywhere.

Their snow-white fur was covered in bright red blood and the wounds that had opened were badly mutilated.

When Chu Xiaoye ran over, the white male tiger seemed to have realized that something was wrong and suddenly started to rush into the depths of the forest.

However, just as he ran for a distance, a group of rhinoceroses suddenly rushed out of the forest in front of him with a rumble. With a bang, they sent him flying back\!

His huge and strong body seemed fragile in front of these giant rhinoceroses.

He fell heavily to the ground, his head covered in blood and a few ribs broken.

When he endured the pain and jumped up from the ground, Tilly had already pounced from behind. Her sharp claws flashed with golden light and pierced through his spine with a "chi". His back slashed open\!

"Roar —"

The white male tiger immediately roared crazily, turned around, and bit over.

Tilly jumped back and jumped away lightly, her golden claws dripping with blood.

The white male tiger's spine broke and it fell to the ground. As it struggled helplessly, it roared in despair and hatred.

The group of giant rhinoceroses ran over angrily. They lowered their heads and pierced the sharp rhinoceros horn into his body. Then, they suddenly raised their heads and sent him flying\!

Before he could land, the other rhinoceroses raised their heads and pierced his body with their sharp rhinoceros horns again, continuing to swing in the air.

Poor this powerful tiger. In midair, its flesh was already flying everywhere and it died\!

"Bam\!"

He fell to the ground, his flesh badly mutilated.

The rhinoceroses rushed up and trampled on them with their iron hooves.

In a moment, the tiger turned into a pool of meat paste and even its bones were broken\!

Especially the two rhinoceroses with a small circle of light on their horns. They looked even more ferocious and angry than the other rhinoceroses.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the hill and watched this scene with flickering eyes.

It seemed that his guess might be right.

That light was indeed the symbol of every animal's strength. An animal with that light would be stronger and more intelligent.

Just as he was thinking about something while looking at the two giant rhinoceroses, Tilly had already arrived beside him and was staring at him with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his gaze and looked at her. Then, he looked at the group of rhinoceroses that were running over. His heart skipped a beat as he turned around and wanted to escape.

Tilly suddenly jumped onto his back and bit his ear. She let out a soft whimper, as if she was comforting him.

"Don't be afraid. From today onwards, you're my lion. Whoever dares to bully you, I won't let him off\!"

The rhinoceros stopped in front of them and glared at Chu Xiaoye with a murderous aura.

Tilly raised her head and looked at them coldly. Then, she lowered her head and stuck out her tongue to lick Chu Xiaoye's head, as if she was warning them.

The rhinoceroses quietened down and retracted their murderous gazes.

However, the two giant rhinoceroses with halos on their horns still looked at Chu Xiaoye with an unkind gaze.

This kid snatched their jobs\!

They were Missy's mounts\!

Tilly turned around and looked at the strange fish corpse at the foot of the hill, then at the male tiger that had been trampled into meat paste. Her gaze flickered for a moment before she suddenly lowered her head and bit Chu Xiaoye's ear. She extended her claws and pointed at the pit on the other side of the hill.

Those giant strange fish from just now were crawled out of the pit.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat and he immediately carried her over.

The rhinoceroses followed closely.

When he came in front of the pit, Chu Xiaoye realized that there was a black hole below that was almost bottomless.

Perhaps, there were other huge strange fish hidden inside.

Tilly immediately growled at the rhinoceroses behind her with a grave expression, as if she was giving instructions.

The two rhinoceros leaders opened their mouths and let out low cries at their other companions behind them, looking dignified and angry.

The other rhinoceroses immediately turned around and left, running in different directions. Clearly, they had gone to report.

Tilly jumped down from Chu Xiaoye's back and jumped up again. She jumped onto the back of a rhinoceros and looked at him with a burning gaze. She hooked her claws at him and gestured for him to go up.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and looked at the hole on the ground. Then, he jumped up and squatted behind her.

Obviously, this matter was not completely resolved.

Since he had encountered it, he had the responsibility to kill all these dangers from the sea in the cradle.

He had the same goal as this little white lion, so he would follow her for the time being to see what she wanted to do.

The rhinoceros carried them and walked towards the icy plain outside the forest.

Another rhinoceros was guarding the entrance of the cave, waiting for reinforcements.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and guessed that they were waiting for their teammates, who were good at walking underground and digging holes, to enter from this cave and investigate the situation inside.

This cave might very well lead to the sea. Therefore, he had to kill all the enemies hiding inside and find the entrance to seal them all.

Then, where were they going?

Tilly turned around and squatted opposite him on the rhinoceros’ back. Her light blue eyes looked at him with watery eyes, as if she had something to say.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. Seeing that he was too close to him and that their heads were almost together, he could feel each other's breathing and hurriedly took a few steps back.

However, he had just taken a few steps back when Tilly took a few more steps forward. She was still so close to him that her eyes were already fixed on him.

For some reason, Chu Xiaoye felt his face heat up.

He could not help but take a few steps back.

Tilly caught up to him again. She stuck her head forward and almost pressed it against his face.

Chu Xiaoye was furious. She was bullying him too much\!

He raised his claws and looked at her warningly.

Don't think that just because you have a bodyguard, This King will not dare to slap you\!

This King hates your arrogant, despotic, and fearless ugly appearance the most\!

This King can slap you if he wants to. If he wants to catch you, he can catch you. If he wants to bite you, he can bite you. If he wants to…

"Roar…"

The little lioness suddenly let out a childish whiny sound. Then, she raised her claws and extended them in front of him, looking at him pitifully.

It turned out that her feet and legs were bitten and she wanted him to lick them.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he immediately turned around and rejected her coldly.

He would not die. Why should he lick\!

Not anyone was qualified to obtain This King's saliva\!

Tilly's body immediately turned limp and she fell to the ground. She rolled her eyes and panted heavily. Her entire body was trembling and she looked like she was about to die.

Hey\! The Oscar Best Actress\!

Chu Xiaoye turned around and sat on her face.

The rhinoceros had just carried them out of the forest when a few roars suddenly came from the icy plain in front of them.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stood up.

The roar was very familiar. It was the roar of a mixed fur lion king.

Was Catherine and the others here too?

"Roar\!"

Unexpectedly, just as he stood up, Tilly, who had been pretending to be sick, suddenly raised her head and bit his butt\!
