Chapter 521: The offspring of the Orcs and elves

Loli was not a lolita.

This guard captain who had supported Lanisi during the palace change was about twenty years old. He was about the same height as Fei'er and did not look especially outstanding, but her elf aura still made her superior to ordinary people.

Her face was always cold and her gaze was sharp. Even to the queen, she always had a serious expression.

When Chu Xiaoye dressed and brought Catherine out of the room, the captain of the guard looked at him with obvious suspicion, as if he was suspecting what he and the Queen had done in the serious and solemn meeting room.

"Loli, where is Nalia waiting? Is it in her guest room? She hasn't used it for a long time."

Lanisi's face was full of smiles and she looked very happy.

This sister had been solitary since she was young and had never liked to play with them. She had never participated in the politics of the palace. Ever since she became the disciple of the high priest, it was even more difficult to see her.

This time, she was naturally very happy that she could take the initiative to say that she wanted to see her.

Loli lowered her head slightly and answered, "Your Majesty, Princess Nalia is waiting in the secret room of the underground cell."

"The cell chamber?"

Lanisi was stunned when she heard this and asked in confusion, "Why is she there?"

Loli said, "The princess said that there are some things that I have to tell you there. She also said that she knew that we had won the battle with the orcs and specially prepared a gift for you."

Lanisi smiled and said, "Her gifts are probably some strange things. She liked those things since she was young."

Lanisi walked ahead with ease, passed through the corridor, went down the stairs, and walked out of the castle.

She walked very quickly, clearly wanting to see her sister, who rarely appeared.

"Night, you'll definitely like Nalia. Although she's silent and doesn't like to communicate with others, she has many strange things in her mind. She'll definitely have many common topics with you."

As Lanisi walked, she turned around and smiled at Chu Xiaoye, who was behind her.

Chu Xiaoye was also quite curious about this Princess Nalia.

He wanted to see what was so special about this elf girl's hair that it changed color every year.

Could it be because of magic?

After walking for a while, Lanisi brought them to an underground cell.

The surroundings were quiet. The elven guards guarding the entrance to the underground were all gone. No one knew where they went.

As Lanisi walked down the stairs, she asked curiously, "Loli, where are the guards? There are more than 50 prisoners locked in the cell, and they're all quite strong orcs. It won't work without guards."

Loli also frowned and said with a puzzled expression, "Could it be that everyone who was here previously went underground to protect Princess Nalia?"

Lanisi quickly went down the stairs and complained, "Nalia shouldn't have come here. No matter what happens, we can talk outside. This is not a good place."

Loli walked in front and pushed open the heavy and thick wooden door.

A humid and unpleasant smell immediately came from the dark cell.

Lanisi frowned and walked in. She apologized to Chu Xiaoye, who was behind her, "Night, no one can guess what Naliya does. She probably chose to see me here because of the orcs."

Loli stood at the door and pushed the wooden door that wanted to close automatically.

Chu Xiaoye followed behind the Queen and walked in. He looked back at Catherine, who was preparing to follow in.

Catherine's dark eyes met his gaze and she was stunned for a moment. Then, she stopped and did not follow in.

Loli said, "Lord Night, is this lioness cub not going in?"

Lanisi also stopped and looked back.

Chu Xiaoye covered his nose and said, "She won't like the smell here. A lion's sense of smell is too sensitive. Perhaps it's a good thing on the grassland, but it will be very uncomfortable here."

Lanisi smiled and said, "That's true."

"Creak\!"

Loli followed in and the heavy and thick wooden door slowly closed.

Lanisi looked at the dark cell and asked curiously, "Why aren't there any guards here? What's Nalia doing? This won't do."

She immediately quickened her steps and walked towards the innermost chamber.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly said, "Your Majesty, why are the orcs in the cell all hiding in the corner and not moving?"

Lanisi stopped and looked around. The orcs who usually started to roar and shout whenever someone came in actually sat in the corner and did not move.

"Loli, what's going on?"

Lanisi turned around and looked at the captain of the guards behind her.

The cell was under her management and all the guards here were under her orders. She should know the situation of these orcs the best.

Loli stood behind the two of them and did not answer the Queen's question immediately.

She walked towards the cell on the left and reached out to touch the heavy iron lock on the door. The iron lock fell to the ground with a bang.

Then, she gently opened the cell door. The orc sitting in the corner inside suddenly stood up and walked out. He carried a huge spiked club full of sharp teeth on his shoulder and looked at the Queen with a ferocious smile.

Lanisi's face was filled with shock. She turned around and looked at her elf captain with a pale face. "Loli, where's Nalia?"

The elf girl, who was standing with the orcs, finally smiled, but it was a very cold smile. She said, "Your Majesty, Princess Nalia is still at the back mountain. She has never been here."

"Crack\!" "Crack\!" "Crack\!"

Right at this moment, all the iron locks on the prison door fell to the ground. The orcs inside pushed open the cell and walked out.

They were all holding weapons\!

Lanisi's face was pale, as if she suddenly understood something.

She looked at the girl in front of her in disbelief and said with a trembling voice, "Loli, why?"

The tall orc standing beside Loli suddenly extended an empty hand and placed it on the elf girl's chest, playing with it wantonly as he let out a chuckle.

"My dear Elven Queen, Miss Loli is addicted to us, so she could not help but betray you."

"Hahaha…"

The other orcs laughed unrestrainedly, then held their weapons and surrounded them with ferocious smiles.

Lanisi still looked at the girl in shock and disbelief and continued, "Loli, tell me, why?"

The guard captain raised his hand and took down the medal that represented her honor from his chest. He casually threw it on the ground, then raised his hand and lifted the silver hair by his ear, revealing one of his ears.

It was a huge, ugly, and rather deformed ear. It was too different from the elves' sharp and exquisite ears.

"Your Majesty, because I'm a descendant of an orc."

The girl put down her silver hair and looked at her coldly with a deep mocking smile. "Under your mother's wise guidance, my mother was abducted by the orcs and gave birth to me. I did not escape back. They let me return. I supported you in the palace change not because I agreed with you, but because I was grateful that you killed your demon mother."

A cold smile appeared on her face. Her gaze as she looked at the queen no longer had the respect from before. Instead, it was disdain. "Your Majesty, under the wise guidance of your father and mother, the prosperous elves split up. The elves who followed you changed from the former fifty thousand to the current one thousand. Do you think that you and your royal family are still qualified to lead the elves?"

"Therefore, Your Majesty, I did not betray you or the elves. I came to save you and your people."

The girl spread her arms and looked intoxicated.

Chu Xiaoye, who had not spoken all this time, suddenly said, "If it were me, I would not have suddenly been exposed after hiding for so long. At least, I would have to wait until the Queen leaves, right? If I were to be exposed now, wouldn't all my previous efforts be wasted?"

The girl narrowed her eyes at him and did not answer.

Chu Xiaoye smiled and said, "So, you've actually already been exposed. Someone has already sensed your true identity, right?"

Veins suddenly jumped on the girl's face, and she looked as ferocious as an orc. She grinned hideously and said, "I have to admit that Princess Nalia is the smartest elf in the elves. This throne should be hers. Unfortunately… Now, you don't have this chance anymore\!"

"Even if you kill the queen, you won't be able to escape\!"

Chu Xiaoye said coldly.

The orc standing beside Loli grinned evilly and drooled from the corner of his mouth. He looked at Lanisi and said, "How can we bear to kill such a beautiful and sexy queen? Little thing, the only person we want to kill now is you. After we kill you, we'll take the queen away. At that time, your noble queen of the elves will enjoy the warm welcome of our companions in our orc tribe. Hahahaha…"

"Clang\!"

Chu Xiaoye pulled out his sword and leaned against the Queen.

Lanisi looked at the former captain of the guards and shook her head. "Loli, you can't escape. The bridge outside is already destroyed, and your scheme has been seen through by Nalia."

Loli sneered and pulled out the sword at her waist. "Your Majesty, you should take care of yourself. I'm afraid Princess Nalia can't even protect herself. As for how we should leave, you don't have to worry. I fed those three pterosaurs from young\!"

With that, she suddenly swung her sword and slashed at Chu Xiaoye.

The other orcs surrounding them also roared angrily and raised their weapons.

Lanisi did not bring her sword this time. She pulled out the dagger at her waist and leaned against the young man behind her.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly dodged Loli's slash and slashed the sword in his hand at the orc on the left. A terrifying strength was attached to the blade. With a crack, he cut off the broken sword in the orc’s hand and cut his neck\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye kicked him away and grabbed the queen behind him. His body flashed and he quickly rushed into the cell closest to the left.

More than 50 orcs were tall, fierce, and strong fellows with weapons. Furthermore, the space here was narrow and he could not use his agility and speed. Even if the two of them had three heads and six arms, they would definitely be difficult to resist.

Therefore, the first thing he thought of was to escape into the cell at the side and occupy the favorable terrain to wait for reinforcements.

Catherine must have gone to report.

Before entering the heavy prison door, he felt that something was wrong and the smell was wrong. Therefore, he used his eyes to tell Catherine to stay outside.

However, he never would have thought that the captain of the guards behind him was actually the descendant of the orcs hiding in the elves. Furthermore, he never would have thought that all the orcs in the cell would already be hiding in the cell with weapons.

"Your Majesty\! Cover your nose\!"

After escaping into the cell, Chu Xiaoye suddenly said to the queen behind him.
