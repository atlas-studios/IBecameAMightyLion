Chapter 50: The Fall of the Lion King

Night fell.

The hyenas' cries were noisy.

After the pride of the cold father returned to the camp, they lay in the bushes to rest and ignored them.

His neighbor, the Senor Brothers, clearly did not do anything either.

Bill's lonely roar seemed so miserable and desperate amid the noisy cries of the hyenas.

At this moment.

He wondered how the six female lions he once had felt when they saw and heard his sad and miserable ending.

Chu Xiaoye slipped into the bushes at the back and walked towards the place where the lion was about to die.

He wanted to see him.

Perhaps, he was looking at his future.

"Roar—"

Bill was roaring and roaring, but he looked so miserable and powerless.

The hyena circled around him and let out unrestrained cries filled with provocation and ridicule.

They were disintegrating his last will.

They wanted to let this lion, who had once terrified them, slowly despair and die in fear\!

Blood dyed Bill's body, the ground below, and his eyes red.

He would rather die in battle.

This way, at least he could retain his dignity as a lion.

A lion lived his life to fight and died in battle\!

Even if he died, he had to die in glory\!

Unfortunately, tonight, he would die at the hands of this group of enemies that he hated and despised the most.

He was furious and unwilling.

His hoarse roar was still filled with the dignity and spirit of a lion.

However, they were no threat to this group of enemies.

He could not get up.

His spine was broken, his hind leg was broken, his abdomen was broken, and his intestines flowed all over the ground.

He was about to die.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas were clearly impatient from waiting, or they had lost all interest in playing with him.

Samantha, the hyena queen, was the first to walk behind him and bite his anus.

Bill was already numb from the pain.

He did not move and turned his head, baring his still sharp and terrifying fangs and roaring angrily.

Unfortunately, the enemy ignored them.

Samantha started to eat his anus.

The other hyenas surrounded him excitedly and started eating the intestines and other internal organs on the ground.

Bill's roars became weaker and weaker as he stared blankly ahead.

In front of him was an endless grassland.

This used to be his territory.

And he was once the supreme king of this land.

His pride and the six female lions were lying in the bushes not far away. They should be watching and listening to him silently.

"Roar…"

He let out one last weak roar, as if he was sighing, feeling sad, and saying goodbye.

Then, he slowly closed his eyes.

The lion king of a generation died just like that…

The night was very dark.

There was no moon or stars.

Even the wind seemed to have stopped.

This land seemed to be mourning for this dead king.

Only the greedy sounds of hyenas swallowing could be heard in the night.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a big tree in the bushes and watched this scene silently, as if he could see himself and Little Curly Tail in the future.

No matter how glorious a king was, he would have the most miserable day.

This was the fate of lions.

They wandered, fought, and died.

His life seemed to be destined.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt a little sad.

Would he also slowly walk down this path in his life?

No.

Of course not\!

He could not surrender\!

After all, he was a different lion\!

He would not yield to such a fate\!

The heat in his body was like the stars in the night, guiding him and giving him hope.

He could live more brilliantly\!

The hyenas enjoyed the food very quickly.

After a moment.

Bill's corpse had been completely eaten.

In order to prevent the sudden attack of the male lions, the Seno brothers, Samantha the hyena queen did not dare to stay any longer. She immediately brought her subordinates and crawled into the bushes, leaving through the border separating the lions on both sides.

This gave Chu Xiaoye a superb opportunity\!

Because at this moment, the tree under him happened to grow in a place that the hyenas had to pass through\!

He had once seen in animal records how leopards hunted on trees.

The leopards hid on the tree, crawling and not moving. They used the dense branches and leaves to cover their bodies.

When the prey passed by the tree, they would suddenly pounce down and bite the prey's neck. They were extremely fast\!

The prey could not react in time.

Hyenas naturally had low standards\!

They rarely looked up, especially when they outnumbered their prey. They would be even more careless.

Because even a pride of lions would be unwilling to provoke them in this situation.

They were the second brothers of Africa who made animals afraid of their own accord\!

At this moment.

Samantha, the hyena queen, was pleased with herself. With the pride of killing a lion, she led the twenty-over hyenas through the bushes and walked towards the big tree Chu Xiaoye was hiding in.

Chu Xiaoye crawled on a low branch and, under the cover of the night and leaves, stared motionless at the pleased Queen.

His dark and bright eyes flickered with a cold light.

Not far away, was where Gigi had once died tragically after being mutilated by them.

Tonight, this hyena queen would also be killed by him here\!

Fifty meters\!

Thirty meters\!

Ten meters\!

As the hyena queen Samantha approached, Chu Xiaoye's muscles trembled.

It was not nervousness or fear, but excitement\!

Facing the twenty-over hyenas that had just eaten the lion's flesh, he did not feel any fear\!

The heat in his body accelerated and surged into his limbs and bones\!

He became even more confident\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Just as Samantha, the hyena queen, walked under the tree, a hyena two meters to her left suddenly raised its head and called out to another tree.

The walking hyenas immediately stopped in their tracks and looked up.

On that big tree, a young female leopard was lying there, baring her fangs and trembling.

She had hidden there long ago.

She had wanted to see why the cub was hiding on the tree. Unexpectedly, the hyenas walked over majestically.

She lay on the tree and, because she was too nervous and afraid, she accidentally made a noise and was discovered by the vigilant hyena\!

At this moment, seeing that the hyenas had raised their heads and were roaring at her fiercely, she was so scared that her entire body was trembling and she was about to fall.

"Mommy…"

She was so scared.

However, her mother went out to hunt.

Even if her mother was here, she would not dare to save her.

These hyenas even dared to attack the ferocious lions\!

Belita regretted it\!

Samantha, the hyena queen, looked up at her and saw that the little leopard was trembling so much that it seemed like it would fall at any moment.

She immediately called out and ordered all the hyenas to gather under the tree and continue to add fear to this timid little fellow.

It seemed that not only could she eat a lion's flesh tonight, she could also eat tender leopard meat\!

The Queen was very happy.

She decided to go back tonight to celebrate.
