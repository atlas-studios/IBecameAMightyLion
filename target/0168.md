Chapter 168: Conquering Land\!

"Oh\!"

The hyena queen finally looked up at him with her mouth full of blood.

The other three female hyenas immediately stopped snatching food and bared their fangs, surrounding him.

Chu Xiaoye's "hand" was really itchy.

Looking at this group of arrogant and greedy fellows, he was more disgusted than when seeing a large piece of feces\!

He could not hold it in anymore\!

"Whoosh—"

Before the three female hyenas could approach, he rushed up\!

When the three female hyenas opened their fangs and were about to bite, two steel-like heavy slaps hit the faces of the two female hyenas with a bang and sent them flying\!

Before the remaining hyena could react, it was pushed to the ground and its throat was bitten\!

From the battle to the end, only a few seconds had passed\!

The hyena queen, who was wolfing down her food without worry, was shocked. She raised her head and looked at the young lion in shock.

The hyenas that were attacking the Chino brothers immediately quietened down and looked over.

Chu Xiaoye would not give them a chance to save their companions\!

Before the female hyena in his mouth could stop breathing, he suddenly jumped up and rushed towards the hyena queen like a whirlwind on the grassland\!

At this moment, the hyenas that were attacking the Chino brothers ran over in panic, preparing to save their queen.

The hyena queen did not escape. Instead, she opened her fangs and charged at him ferociously\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and slapped the queen's head\!

However, he missed\!

Just as the two sides were about to approach, the hyena queen suddenly jumped to the side and dodged\!

Then, she immediately turned around and pounced ferociously behind Chu Xiaoye\!

She was very fast and her movements were extremely agile\!

Chu Xiaoye had just landed when she had already pounced behind. She lowered her body and lowered her head to bite between Chu Xiaoye's legs\!

The fangs that were revealed were sharp and cold\!

This was the hyena's most vicious move\!

As long as it was bitten, any animal would instantly lose their combat strength and fall to the ground\!

Her eyes flickered with a pleased and ruthless cold light. This little lion could not turn around in time, let alone dodge\!

She seemed to have already heard the other party's miserable scream, as if she could already see this little lion crawling on the ground, crying out in pain and despair\!

Go to hell\!

"Bang\!"

However, just as she opened her fangs and was about to pounce in, a foot suddenly enlarged in her eyes\!

Then, he kicked her eyeballs heavily\!

The hyena queen was caught off guard\!

An intense pain suddenly assaulted her from her eyeball\!

She suddenly jumped up and let out a miserable scream\!

As for her eyeball, blood splashed everywhere and it was directly exploded by that kick\!

Before she could let out a second scream, Chu Xiaoye had already turned around and pounced on her, locking her throat\!

The two rows of sharp teeth pierced into her muscles and her neck with a crack\!

She opened her mouth and could not scream anymore.

At this moment, her subordinates rushed over.

The thirty-plus spotted hyenas charged over majestically with a murderous aura, roaring shrilly and angrily.

Chu Xiaoye did not retreat.

He bit the hyena queen's throat and raised his head, looking coldly at the pack of strong hyenas.

The Chino brothers and the male leopard staring at him from the tree thought that he would immediately put down the hyena queen and turn around to escape. Then, he would use his strategy to defeat them one by one.

However, he bit the hyena queen and walked towards the ferocious hyena army\!

His steps were very slow, but he was very calm.

The hyena queen, who was even larger than him, was in his mouth with its mouth open. One of its eyeballs was dripping with blood and it was still struggling and moving its legs.

Her other eye was wide open as she looked at her ferocious subordinates in despair.

The aggressive hyena army suddenly stopped when they were only three meters away from Chu Xiaoye. They looked at him in fear and hesitated with the queen in his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye bit the hyena queen and continued forward, walking towards them.

That calm and composed expression, his cold gaze, and his aura as he bit the hyena queen made this group of ferocious hyenas tremble in fear\!

"Whoosh\!"

When Chu Xiaoye walked only a meter away from them with the hyena queen in his mouth, the neat and brave hyena army that had just shared a common enemy suddenly turned chaotic\!

The few at the front turned around and fled, feeling extremely terrified\!

Then, the other hesitating hyenas immediately panicked. They hurriedly turned around and ran away\!

Then, all the hyenas started to scream in fear and flee\!

The leopard father and daughter on the tree watched this scene in bewilderment.

"Roar—"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly let go of the hyena queen in his mouth and let out a dignified roar\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

When the hyenas that were running in panic heard this roar, they immediately peed their pants in fear and ran for their lives in fear\!

In the blink of an eye, the hyena army escaped from this territory and disappeared into the distant grassland.

The hyena queen lowered her head and finally stopped breathing.

The Chino brothers and the jackal couple, who were standing not far away, looked at their young new king in a daze, as if they were dreaming.

His strength, courage, and invincible aura were unbelievable\!

Such a large and ferocious hyena army did not even have the courage to attack. They were scared away by his extremely strong aura\!

At this moment, their hearts were filled with respect and pride for this young king\!

This was their king\!

The vultures surrounded the corpse of the black-haired lion again and ate heartily.

Today, every one of them would have a full meal.

Chu Xiaoye left in front of the hyena queen's corpse and looked up at the distant grassland.

He had to mark the borders of the territory.

As for size, he could do whatever he wanted.

However, it was best to control it within a twenty-kilometer radius.

Otherwise, the work of marking the territory and patrolling the territory would tire them out.

Furthermore, he was not the true king yet.

The true lion king of this territory had yet to appear.

The Chino brothers were injured and needed to recuperate. They could not help him mark the territory for the time being.

Therefore, he could only rely on himself now.

He walked towards the distant grassland alone and started to mark the territory with this forest as the center.

To the lion king of every territory, it was very difficult to mark and patrol their territory as some territories were too big. Sometimes, the lion would have to spend half a month to return after going out to work. But it was all worth it.

This job was at least much better than clashing with those wandering lions.

At least, he would not be in danger of losing or losing his life.

Most wandering lions would leave sensibly after smelling the scent they left behind to avoid conflict.

Only those fellows who wanted to fight the lion king and snatch his territory and lionesses would barge into his territory without restraint.

Usually, after having these scent marks, other carnivores would restrain themselves and not dare to swagger in to hunt.

This was not the only reason why Chu Xiaoye was in such a hurry to mark the borders.

He only felt that only by completing this process could he truly have this territory.

He also wanted to tell the pride that this territory already belonged to him. He did not want much, only this little land.

If the other party was unwilling and still wanted to chase them away or take revenge, he would use his identity as the owner of the territory to treat them as invaders and kill them without mercy\!

This was the rule of the pride and all the animals on the grassland.

If you defeat the strong, you will be the strong; if you defeat your master, you will be the master.

He could not be blamed.

Chu Xiaoye started to leave his scent on the grass and mark the borders of the territory.

Although the battle had just ended, he did not feel any fatigue. Instead, he was extremely excited and full of energy.

This was the first time he had his own territory.

Although he was still a distance away from the true lion king, his dream was already close and within reach. He was naturally excited.

This territory would be his new home with the pride of the cold father in the future\!

An old lion king would usually be chased away by a young and strong new lion king. He would wander around, starve, and be bullied before dying in humiliation. However, he would not do that to his father.

There was plenty of food and resources here, and his father could stay and enjoy them.

As long as that fellow did not mess around, he and Little Curly Tail would send him off in his old age.

After all, the word father could not be ignored by him.

Perhaps, he could not be considered a true lion.

However, it was okay. A lion like him might not be inferior to other lions.

"Chi—"

He raised his head and retreated, peeing bit by bit.

Lions were very magical. They could control the number of pees and split them into several segments to pee. Furthermore, they could pee whenever they wanted to.

Just as he was thinking about something and marking his territory, a figure suddenly jumped out from the grass beside him and pounced on him\!

This speed was not inferior to his\!

Chu Xiaoye was caught off guard and was pushed to the ground.

He was shocked. Just as he was about to open his mouth to bite, two rows of sharp teeth grabbed his neck\!

Just as the two rows of sharp teeth were about to penetrate his skin, his two hind legs suddenly flicked and kicked the attacker on him down\!

At the same time, urine flew out.

He hurriedly jumped up and prepared to counterattack\!

"Bang\!"

A slap suddenly landed on his face\!

His head tilted and he fell to the ground again.

When he rolled and jumped up, the figure suddenly crawled into the grass in the distance and quickly left\!

That speed was really as fast as lightning\!

From the beginning to the end, he did not see the other party's face or appearance. He only saw a white figure flash away.

He was stunned in place, and his face was burning with pain.

This was the first time he was slapped.

Damn it\!

Who was it? He actually ambushed him while he was peeing\!

Despicable\!
