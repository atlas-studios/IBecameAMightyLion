Chapter 590: Red-eyed Monster

"Roar—"

Outside the town, a black mass of ferocious beasts suddenly appeared and roared as they rushed into the town like a tide.

The lively crowd in the town immediately screamed and fled everywhere.

The soldiers guarding the place held their guns and saw that the ferocious beasts were already mixed in with the people in the town and could not shoot.

The ferocious beasts roared and rushed towards the Bestial Battle Arena.

On the colosseum, while the humans were dizzy from the lion king's roar and felt their bodies go limp, Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed out of the iron bars with Mei Mei.

The other ferocious beasts imprisoned in the iron bars also took advantage of the chaos to run around and bite.

When the soldiers guarding outside heard the noise, they immediately rushed in with their guns and started shooting crazily at the crazy ferocious beasts.

"Boom —"

The houses in the colosseum suddenly collapsed one after another\!

The soldiers standing on it and shooting immediately screamed and fell into the ruins, buried in it and never able to get up again.

Chu Xiaoye used his huge body and strong strength to charge ferociously in the house under the Colosseum. The entire Colosseum started to sway violently and sway.

The people sitting on it watching the performance had long turned pale in fear and ran around.

"Boom —"

A loud bang\!

The Beast Fighting Arena, which had lost its support below, actually collapsed\!

In the dust that filled the sky, Chu Xiaoye brought Mei Mei and the group of ferocious beasts that had obtained freedom and rushed into the street and the crowd.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The soldiers that rushed over from the street started to shoot crazily.

The soldiers stationed nearby who had received the news immediately drove their tanks over to save them.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the ferocious beasts that had escaped from the Bestial Battle Arena and joined up with the more than 200 ferocious beasts that had attacked from outside the town, a large number of tanks quickly gathered outside the town.

The terrifying muzzles and cannon were all neatly aimed at this ancient town.

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and stopped the ferocious beasts from slaughtering the humans in the town.

The humans were terrified. They fled everywhere and ran out of the town with all their might.

Chu Xiaoye ordered all the ferocious beasts to split up and mix in the panicked crowd, escaping outside.

There were at least ten thousand people gathered in the town today. In fear, they fled outside in a black mass.

The ferocious beasts mixed in and ran out of the town from all directions.

The soldiers surrounding outside did not know what to do when they saw this scene. If they fired, these humans would not be able to escape misfortune.

However, if they did not shoot, the crazy ferocious beasts would immediately run out with the terrified humans, run close, and pounce on them.

"Stand in place and don't move\! Everyone, stand in place and don't move\!"

A golden-haired officer immediately held a microphone and shouted at the entire town.

If the people in the town stood in place and did not move, the soldiers surrounding them could immediately distinguish and aim at the ferocious beasts to kill them one by one.

However, how could the terrified humans listen to his orders? Furthermore, the ferocious beasts roared and threatened as they ran. Therefore, the people in the town were still running out of the town in panic and did not stop.

"Fire\! Fire\!"

The officer immediately ordered angrily.

"Bang bang bang\!"

Blue flames jumped at the gun barrel, and countless bullets hit the running people and the ferocious beasts mixed in.

Soon, many humans and ferocious beasts fell to the ground.

At this moment, the terrified humans stopped running and stopped in place with pale faces.

"Everyone stop\! Stand in place and don't move\! Otherwise, our guns will fire at you and those ferocious beasts\!"

The officer shouted at the megaphone again.

Seeing that many people had fallen into a pool of blood and the tanks and guns outside were aimed at them, the people in the town finally stopped and stood in place, trembling.

Many women cried and shouted for help.

Under Chu Xiaoye's roar, the running ferocious beasts also stopped and hid behind the crowd.

The two sides faced each other like this.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The human snipers started to move.

The soldiers in the town also held their guns and started to shoot the ferocious beasts mixed in the crowd.

In their fear, the ferocious beasts started to bite the humans crazily.

The humans screamed and fled again.

The town that had just quietened down fell into chaos again.

"Fire\! Fire\!"

When the ferocious beasts mixed in the crowd and ran towards the soldiers outside, the officer ordered coldly again.

"Ah —"

Right at this moment, the terrified scream of the human officer suddenly came from the megaphone.

At the same time, the soldiers that surrounded the entire town immediately let out cries and cries.

"The monster is here\! The monster is here\!"

The soldiers shouted with terrified expressions.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

"Bang bang bang\!"

The gun started to aim at its companions. The volcano swallowed and fired with all its might.

Group after group of red-eyed monsters appeared behind the soldiers and pounced at them.

The tank hurriedly turned around and aimed at the red-eyed monsters outside, attacking with all its might.

However, the red eyes had long rushed into their army and started biting crazily.

The soldiers fled into the town in fear.

The gunshots and terrified cries of the soldiers sounded everywhere.

The people and ferocious beasts in the town suddenly quietened down and looked outside.

The soldiers that surrounded the town fled towards them and let out desperate cries. "The monster is here\! The monster is here\!"

The monsters that had occupied the city and killed humans had actually come here\!

Where was the stronghold in front? Could it be that they had already fallen?

The soldiers were in despair. As they ran, they turned around and fired. They could not tell the monster from their companions.

Countless running soldiers fell into a pool of blood.

Densely packed red-eyed monsters rushed up and bit the pitiful soldiers, tearing them into pieces.

Chu Xiaoye and Mei Mei stood together and watched this terrifying scene. Their hearts started to turn cold.

The surroundings were occupied by the red-eyed monsters. The soldiers who had just been flaunting their might with their guns were like stray dogs.

All the living humans squeezed into the town and started to shoot crazily outside.

The ferocious beasts mixed in the crowd were surprisingly tacit and did not take the opportunity to attack them from behind.

There were too many red-eyed monsters\!

They fell and got up again. The soldiers who were bitten to death soon staggered up and turned into monsters with red eyes.

The soldiers fired crazily and the red-eyed monsters fell in rows, but they still slowly approached and pounced forward.

"Roar —"

They let out the roars of wild beasts and were extremely strong. Their two arms suddenly exerted strength and tore the strong soldiers into two.

The people in the town were terrified and in despair, screaming endlessly.

"Buzz…"

Right at this moment, a strange sound suddenly came from the sky.

Then, the buzzing became clearer and larger, like thunder, quickly approaching.

A huge shadow covered the entire town\!

Everyone hurriedly looked up and were even more terrified\!

The black mass of demon mosquitoes roared as they charged over\!
