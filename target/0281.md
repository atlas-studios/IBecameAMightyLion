Chapter 281: Competing for Love

The results were out very quickly.

The scent of the black lion was indeed lingering on this lioness.

The scent of this female cub was the only thing on the four dead cubs.

Obviously.

She was a spy who colluded with the enemy and the murderer of these four young cubs\!

These four young cubs were given to her to raise before her sisters died. They were not her biological children, but their relationship with her had always been very deep. No one would have thought that she would actually kill them for a black lion\!

"Roar—"

Just as her pride was filled with righteous indignation and was about to pounce on her and kill her family personally, this female lion suddenly roared angrily. With a whoosh, she shot out and ran out of the territory.

She did not want to die.

She did not expect that the strong black lion would die so quickly. She also did not expect that her actions did not bring any trouble to this young king.

Now, she had already been abandoned and become a notorious traitor.

She had to leave this place and start over.

She was very fast.

However, she fell very quickly.

Ever since she slandered this young king, she had already died in Catherine's heart.

No one could save her\!

Silver light bloomed in her abdomen.

Blood sprayed and internal organs flowed all over the ground.

After running for more than ten meters, her vision turned black. With a bang, she fell to the ground and could not stand up again.

Catherine still could not vent her anger. She walked close and suddenly grabbed her face, tearing her entire face off.

Blood sprayed on her face.

Her expression was especially ferocious at this moment.

When Little Curly Tail saw this scene, he was secretly terrified. This female cub was becoming more and more terrifying.

The Jerry brothers walked in front of Chu Xiaoye and apologized in shame.

This territory was under their control, but now, a traitor was the first to appear. They felt that they had no face to face this king who had saved their brothers' lives.

Chu Xiaoye did not say anything. He looked gloomily at the corpses of the four young cubs on the ground and thought about what he was going to do next.

The defection of this lioness was not something to be surprised about.

Any kingdom would have traitors.

Perhaps, from the beginning, the black lion knew this lioness and especially let her go.

Any female animal would yearn for stronger males and groups.

However, some could guard their limits, and some would eventually lose themselves.

Chu Xiaoye left with the team.

Little Curly Tail dragged the black lion's corpse back to the bushes. Then, he followed his orders and peeled off the black fur, hanging it on the tree to dry.

After this happened, the prides of every territory received the news and started to patrol more.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this black lion was definitely a very important role to those black lions. The other party would definitely not let the matter rest.

A great battle was likely to arrive.

At that time, no one knew if they could successfully defeat the enemy.

However, casualties were inevitable.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and looked at the members of the pride of the cold father. He felt a little guilty.

It turned out that he had left his home with the intention of going to the other side of the mountain and building a better and safer home for them to live without worries. But now, he had placed them on the frontline of the battle and could encounter the ferocious impact of the black pride at any time.

Was he a little selfish by doing this?

He stayed here and brought this group of wandering lions who had lost their homes and family to build such a territory. Was it really for the sake of righteousness, to reclaim his former home, or to satisfy his vanity and pursue the highest and most dazzling honor?

He had always tried his best to tell himself that he only wanted to live peacefully and live happily with his family. However, his bones had always contained the true dream of a lion.

He would dominate the grassland and become a true king of the grassland.

When he was young, he would always think this way when he looked at the majestic cold father and the mighty lions. He would always outline this dream.

He originally thought that as he grew older, he would have already seen through these things and lost interest. Actually, deep in his heart, these dreams were still hidden and he had never abandoned them.

As his strength increased and his companions increased, this dream became stronger.

However, he was betting the fate of all the members of the pride of the cold father for his dream and his fake responsibility.

Once he failed, he would be doomed.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly understood what Tilly had told him that night.

"Roar\!"

Just as he was looking at the members of the pride of the cold father below and thinking about something, Mei Mei went in front of him and leaned on his body to lie down.

She realized that her brother was in a bad mood, so she came over and rubbed her head against his body to comfort him.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her gently and thought to himself, If Mei Mei brought the pride of the cold father to the other side of the mountain, would she be willing?

The pride of the mixed fur and blue-eyed lion king were all there. He could not selfishly keep these two lions here.

If the pride of the cold father wanted to go over, these two strong lions could escort them. With Mei Mei and the Chino brothers, there should be no worries on the way.

A bloody battle would arrive at any time.

Other than Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, the combat strength of the pride of the cold father was not too strong. It was useless to stay here. Instead, it would make him uneasy and make him unable to fight more devotedly.

There was also Nunu and Qiqi. It would be extremely dangerous if they stayed here.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly climbed up the tree and forced Mei Mei away. He lay beside his brother and leaned close to him.

The sky was about to brighten.

He ended the patrol mission in advance and let Molly continue patrolling while he ran back to sleep.

After all, he had done a lot in the previous battle. He felt that not only would his brother not blame him, he would also praise him fiercely.

He narrowed his eyes and leaned tightly against his brother, waiting for his praise.

However, what he waited for was a merciless slap from his brother.

Chu Xiaoye slapped him and told him to scram down and continue patrolling. He could only return when the sun rose.

His dream had just started and he was already lazy. How could he follow him in the future and fight everywhere and dominate the grassland?

If he wanted to succeed, the rules could not be messed up.

Everyone had to follow it.

Little Curly Tail could only climb down the tree in grievance.

Mei Mei continued to lie beside her brother and stay close to him. She lowered her head and looked at him gloatingly, grinning at him.

Little Curly Tail looked up at her and gave her a disdainful look.

"Look at how you lick dogs\! No matter how you lick, you can't change the fact that I'm your brother\!"

Little Curly Tail strode away and decided to take revenge on Molly.

Molly was Mei Mei's good friend. He could not hit Mei Mei, but he could hit Jasmine. He just had to not let his brother see him.

"Roar—"

Just as Molly was peeing on the grass, Little Curly Tail suddenly pounced over. Without any explanation, he rode on her and beat her up mercilessly\!

"Damn girl\! How dare you pee without my permission\! You're asking for a beating\!"
