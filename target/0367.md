Chapter 367: Untitled

"Buzz…"

The buzzing became clearer and louder.

Gradually, it was like thunder rumbling, approaching from afar and deafening\!

All the members of the pride looked up and were stunned by the black scene that covered the sky and covered the moon.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light. Through the darkness, he could clearly see the three huge black clouds moving quickly in the sky. They were formed by the Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes\!

These Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes were huge and were like strong and healthy eagles. They were lined up neatly.

Killing intent surged\!

Fortunately, this group of terrifying bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes seemed to be just passing by and had no intention of stopping.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and was heaving a sigh of relief. However, the three huge black clouds suddenly stopped in midair and did not move.

Then, as if the sky had broken, a piece fell. In the middle of the three black clouds, a huge Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquito suddenly left the team and flew down.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled\!

The huge demon mosquito was more than ten meters long and terrifyingly big\!

Obviously, this huge demon mosquito was the king of this group of bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes\!

After landing for a distance, the huge Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquito Queen suddenly stopped. Her huge wings could not be seen to flap, but she floated steadily in midair and did not move.

At this moment, a group of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes seemed to have received an order and immediately left the team, quickly landing.

Chu Xiaoye immediately faced a great enemy. He growled and let the mixed fur, the sisters, and the female lions quickly approach him.

The Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes landed extremely quickly. In the blink of an eye, they were already hundreds of meters above him.

Chu Xiaoye curled his tail and waited solemnly.

However, the group of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes did not seem to have the intention of attacking them. They only circled above their heads for a while before suddenly rising up and flying back.

They flew to the side of the demon mosquito queen and quickly flapped their wings. They swayed their heads, as if they were reporting something.

The huge Demon Mosquito Queen seemed to lower her head and look down. Her sharp mouth trembled slightly. After a while, she flew back to the team and quickly left with the black mass of the army.

Seeing the three huge black clouds leave and the sky regained its hazy light, Chu Xiaoye's breathing finally became smooth.

He did not dare to stay here any longer and immediately returned with the team.

He originally thought that these Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes were only on the other side of the mountain. He did not expect them to appear here. Furthermore, they were each larger than the other.

The sky was really going to change.

At dawn, the sun did not rise and it was drizzling under the dark clouds.

The already low temperature became even colder.

Chu Xiaoye, who was wearing a thick scarf, was naturally not afraid of the cold. In the past, before his mane grew, he did not feel uncomfortable even in the cold snowy mountain.

The rain fell in the river, splashing a little, but soon disappeared, just like the lives that had just bloomed but quickly withered on this grassland.

A few crocodiles raised their heads and revealed their huge bodies on the water.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Mixed Fur, and the Jiela sisters, to the river and looked down.

These crocodiles were already more than five meters long. After the second blood rain, their bodies did not change much, but their appearances looked even more ferocious and terrifying. The teeth in their mouths also became stronger and sharper.

They seemed to have heard the noise and turned around to look at Chu Xiaoye and the others, but they were not interested in hunting.

Perhaps, animal instincts or gradually growing intelligence made them smell danger.

On the other side of the river, the excited roars of the Chino brothers suddenly came.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. The two brothers were standing by the river under the rain, wagging their tails and jumping around excitedly.

He had called out to them for the entire night last night and was still waiting here. It seemed that the two brothers' feelings for the sisters were exceptionally deep.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and let the sisters bring the six female lions to cross the river first.

The Jiela sisters jumped over, but they ignored the two excited fellows who came over and wagged their tails to welcome them warmly. Instead, they turned around and looked at the six female lions.

These six female lions were their sisters.

The river was a little wide, but for lions who had experienced two rounds of blood, jumping over was not difficult.

However, there were a few huge crocodiles hiding in the river. The six female lions were afraid that when they jumped, they would be bitten by the giant crocodiles and dragged into the water to roll. They would definitely die.

Just as they were hesitating, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down from the river and landed on the head of a crocodile.

The crocodile was clearly a little stunned. After being stunned for a few seconds, it jumped in fright. It hurriedly raised its head and opened its mouth, revealing two rows of sharp fangs, wanting to bite.

However, Chu Xiaoye stood steadily on its head, preventing it from using its strength.

The other crocodiles beside him immediately surrounded him.

Just as the first crocodile rushed over and opened its mouth, preparing to pounce on it and bite it, Chu Xiaoye jumped and landed on its head, closing its open mouth.

"Whoosh\!"

The waves churned and the second crocodile opened its mouth to pounce on him again.

In the end, Chu Xiaoye quickly jumped on its head again and pressed it down. Its mouth could not help but close.

Another third and fourth crocodiles pounced over. Chu Xiaoye dodged them at lightning speed and jumped on their heads.

This jumping around immediately angered the group of ferocious giant crocodiles. They shook their heads and wagged their tails helplessly.

Their huge bodies and long mouths had already become burdens in front of Chu Xiaoye's agile speed.

The six female lions standing by the river watched this scene in a daze, stunned.

"Roar—"

The sisters on the other side of the river immediately roared and urged the six female lions to hurry and jump over. Their king was personally taking the risk to give them a chance to cross the river.

Although this risk looked like he was playing.

The six female lions woke up and immediately retreated a distance, sprinting and jumping over.

At this moment, the group of giant crocodiles had already lost their minds from Chu Xiaoye's playing. They went crazy and were actually attacking each other and biting their companions.

"Your head is so big that this cub is standing on it\!"

"Who asked you to have such a long mouth and swing it everywhere to stop me from biting that cub\!"

"Don't touch me\! Stay away from me\!"

A group of huge crocodiles squeezed together. They pushed and shoved, raised their heads, and pounced. It was inevitable that they would accidentally injure their companions and cause friction.

In fact, when a stupid giant crocodile pounced at Chu Xiaoye, it bit its companion's front leg and immediately did a death roll, instantly biting off its companion's thigh.

The six female lions that had jumped to the other side still stood neatly on the shore. They stretched their necks and looked straight at this exciting scene that they would never see in their lives.

This young king actually easily played around with this group of terrifying giant crocodiles, and it was in the water\!

Mixed Fur and Catherine jumped over.

After Chu Xiaoye saw that everyone was crossing the river, he jumped up from the head of a huge crocodile and landed steadily on the shore.

The gazes of the six female lions followed his agile and light figure from the river to the shore in a daze.

Now, they understood even more why their two big sisters, who were braver than male lions before, would willingly submit and respect this young lion king.

He was so handsome and strong\!

The Chino brothers pressed their hot faces against their cold butts, but they still did not know shame. They twisted their butts and circled the sisters fawningly. They even wanted to go up and rub against the sisters.

However, a glance from these two sisters made them tremble in fear and not dare to be impudent.

They always remembered the fear of being dominated by these two sisters.

After the excitement, they started to be afraid again. Once the two sisters returned, the two of them would suffer. They could not sleep anymore. Not only did they have to patrol every day, they also had to force them to pee and mark the territory. They even had to help hunt. They treated them as slaves\!

However… it was better than being a bachelor.

Therefore, deep in their hearts, they were still very happy and vaguely felt the pleasure of being tortured.

The rain was dripping and did not stop.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team back to the bushes and met the members of the pride of the cold father. They got to know each other.

Rain drizzled from his blue eyes. He brought Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly out to familiarize themselves with the territory and patrol the surroundings to chase away other competitors.

Mixed Fur ran around for the night but did not rest. Once he returned, he dutifully went to the other side to patrol.

The sisters brought the six female lions, Aisha, and the other female lions to familiarize themselves with the territory and hunt.

Tilly was still sleeping on the tree. The dense leaves above her head blocked the rain for him.

Chu Xiaoye did not see the human girl.

The little girl's white socks and leather shoes were washed clean and hung on the bushes at the side, but she was nowhere to be seen.

Catherine seemed to know who he was looking for and immediately followed the little girl's scent into the depths of the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye followed behind and soon saw the little girl.

At this moment, the little girl was lying in the arms of the cute violent bear mother with the cute violent bear cub. They were hiding under a low and lush tree, looking like a family.

The rain was a little cold.

The thick fur on the cute bear warmed the little girl.

The little girl was wearing a slightly wet dress and was curled up in the arms of the big cute violent bear. She was sleeping soundly with the little cute violent bear. There was a smile on her exquisite little face, as if she was having a dream.

The monkey's fur was already abandoned on the way. The weather here was extremely rainy and the temperature was very low. If the little girl only had this thin dress, she would definitely not be able to resist it.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the drizzling sky.

He did not like rain either.

If there was a hut on a tree that could shelter them from the wind, rain and enemies, it would actually be quite good, right?

He turned around and looked at the few thick Baobab trees on the pride's camp.

Other than living, wasn't life just enjoyment?

Wouldn't it be better if he enjoyed himself on the way to becoming a hegemon?

Since he had this ability, why not use it?

He really did not like to be drenched in the rain, it was not because of some pitiful little thing.
