Chapter 160: Water Monster at the Bottom of the Lake\!

"Ahhh\!"

Right at this moment, the hyena leader suddenly raised its neck and let out a high and long cry.

The chaotic hyenas immediately stopped chasing Chu Xiaoye and quickly gathered together, walking in front of the hyena leader.

The hyena leader looked at Chu Xiaoye coldly, then quickly left with the hyenas.

He was decisive and determined.

As for the hyenas that had fallen to the ground, they did not look at them again and abandoned them.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and watched solemnly as they left in an orderly manner. He became secretly vigilant.

For the first time, he deeply felt the threat of this old enemy.

The hyenas would not let the matter rest.

Furthermore, their queen did not seem to have appeared.

These twenty-plus spotted hyenas were probably only a part of the entire tribe.

There were nearly twenty members in the pride, and if this pack of spotted hyenas wanted to survive nearby, their numbers were at least twice that of the other party.

Otherwise, under the threat of the pride, they would not have survived until now.

Only an evenly-matched enemy that could pose a threat to the other party and make them afraid would be qualified to coexist.

Different species generally would not separate their territories. Most of them overlapped.

However, the territories of lions and hyenas were divided.

In the territory of lions, other than being unable to have other species, hyenas were not allowed to build their territory. As for other animals, they could do so.

The hyenas' territory was mostly chosen where no lions gathered.

They had been enemies for generations and were the strongest competitors. As long as they encountered each other, a battle would definitely happen.

The twenty-over hyenas that had left were clearly only a small portion of the hyena pack, and the leader of the hyenas was probably only a subordinate of the hyena queen.

However, even so, their strength had already reached this extent.

Even the Chino brothers were injured\!

If they were on the grassland over there, the hyenas would flee if they saw the Chino brothers from afar.

But here, the two adult lions were no threat to the spotted hyenas\!

This was unbelievable to Chu Xiaoye.

It was bad enough that those hyenas were big, but their team spirit was also so terrifying. They all appeared very brave and were extremely united. This simply refreshed his understanding of these old enemies.

Obviously, the animals on this land were different from those on the other side.

Be it physique or spirit, they were not just a little stronger.

It seemed that Chu Xiaoye's path to becoming a king still had a long way to go.

The Chino brothers rushed to the side of the few hyenas that were still alive and bit them fiercely.

The two brothers felt that their confidence had been severely damaged.

The animals here made them, the kings of the grassland, feel ashamed.

Chu Xiaoye checked their injuries and saw that there were no major problems.

However, he could not stay here for long.

He immediately brought them out of the bushes and walked towards the lake.

The lake near the forest was safer.

There were many hyenas and they had a natural advantage when attacking the enemy on the grassland.

When they reached the lush and dense forest, they would lose this advantage.

He had just used the bushes and trees to break their formation.

The hyenas' reaction speed and their natural body size made it difficult for them to run at full speed in the forest with varying slopes.

He needed to rest tonight.

Therefore, he had to guard against those fellows coming back to take revenge.

After returning to the lake.

Everyone found a place and lay down. Soon, they closed their eyes.

The little elephant was clearly sleepy as well and lay beside Chu Xiaoye.

Usually, elephants would not lie down to sleep for safety. However, this was clearly not an ordinary elephant. Even if it wanted to eat meat one day, Chu Xiaoye would not be surprised.

The night was very quiet.

In the dark and deep forest, there were no sounds of animals.

The water beside them glistened under the moonlight.

Chu Xiaoye was very tired after running around for the night and fighting for a long time.

He soon fell asleep.

The animals on the grassland slept very lightly and were very vigilant.

As long as an enemy approached, they would generally sense it quickly.

Therefore, this non-mainstream team that had just been formed did not stand on guard.

At midnight.

Chu Xiaoye vaguely smelled a humid stench in his sleep.

When he opened his eyes in a daze, he suddenly saw a circle of ripples in the lake beside him. Under the bright moonlight, they were shining brightly.

However, there was nothing on the water.

He was stunned for a moment, thinking that it was the fish in the lake.

He turned around and realized that the little elephant lying beside him had disappeared.

He looked up and did not find any trace of the little elephant.

Could it be that fellow went to the bushes to eat again?

"Whoosh\!"

At this moment, water suddenly splashed out from the lake\!

Something rose from the water and swayed in the water, looking rather strange.

Chu Xiaoye stared at the object carefully and immediately stood up.

That thing looked like the nose of the little elephant\!

Could it be that it was playful and sneaked into the lake?

Chu Xiaoye immediately walked to the lake and stared at the nose, preparing to shout at it.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that there was a long and wide trail of water on the ground beside the lake, all the way to the place where he had just slept. The water was emitting a faint stench, identical to the smell he smelled in his sleep.

Right at this moment, the nose that peeked out of the water suddenly sank into the lake and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye widened his eyes and stared at the water.

After waiting for a long time, the nose did not extend out again.

He immediately became anxious. Just as he was about to roar angrily, the lake in front of him suddenly let out a bang and a huge splash flew up\!

Then, a thick tentacle wrapped around his body with a whoosh and dragged him into the lake\!

"Whoosh\!"

Waves splashed and the lake water boiled\!

Chu Xiaoye was caught off guard and fell into the lake, sinking quickly\!

At this moment, the Chino brothers and the jackal couple, who were sleeping, immediately woke up and ran to the lake.

However, the lake was empty except for the continuous waves.

At the bottom of the lake.

Chu Xiaoye was wrapped by a thick tentacle and moving quickly towards the center of the lake.

He suddenly saw the little elephant\!

The little elephant was like him, wrapped around by a thick tentacle\!

However, due to the little elephant's desperate struggle, the tentacle looked a little strained and was dragging more slowly.

When Chu Xiaoye was quickly dragged by the tentacle and passed by it, the little elephant looked terrified and desperate.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly opened his mouth and bit the tentacles wrapped around it\!

The soft and smooth meat and the special smell of decay made him almost vomit\!

The tentacle seemed to be in pain as it suddenly trembled and let go of the little elephant. However, with a whoosh, it wrapped his entire head\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's body and head were wrapped in the tentacles. No traces could be seen\!

The little elephant broke free but did not leave immediately. Instead, it quickly stuck out its nose and curled the tentacle that was wrapped around Chu Xiaoye.

The two tentacles dragged Chu Xiaoye and the little elephant and quickly moved towards the middle of the lake\!

"Crack\!"

Right at this moment, the little elephant's body suddenly collided with something hard and it immediately stopped.

The two tentacles seemed to be stuck there and could not be moved.

The tentacle that was wrapped around Chu Xiaoye's head immediately let go and started lashing at the little elephant's body.

Chu Xiaoye's vision finally recovered.

However, when he saw the thing in front of him clearly, he was shocked. He even forgot that he was in a dangerous situation\!

In front of him stood a huge skeleton\!

The skeleton was about six to seven meters tall and was more than ten meters long. Its neck was slender and the two rows of teeth in its mouth were extremely sharp. Its tail bones were thick and long. Its entire body stood steadily at the bottom of the lake, looking like an ancient dinosaur\!

He could clearly feel that this was a white skeleton and not a fossil\!

At this moment, he and the little elephant were stuck in the gap in the ribs on the chest of this dinosaur skeleton\!

The two black tentacles tried their best to drag them away, but they could not drag them away from here\!

Chu Xiaoye saw that the tentacle was slapping the little elephant fiercely and immediately woke up. He suddenly lowered his head and bit the tentacle that was wrapped around his body\!

The tentacle felt pain and twitched before quickly letting go\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately took the opportunity to crawl into the middle of the dinosaur's ribs and bit another tentacle\!

The tentacle that was whipping the little elephant also trembled in pain and quickly shrank back.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly let go of his teeth and opened his mouth at the little elephant to let it escape\!

He could cover the retreat by hiding in these ribs\!

He could still hold his breath for a long time.

The little elephant knew that it could not hesitate now. It immediately landed at the bottom of the lake, turned around, and ran back the way it came.

It walked very slowly and anxiously.

Clearly, it was lacking in oxygen.

The two tentacles hesitated in front of the dinosaur bone and did not chase after it. They immediately swayed and retreated quickly.

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief. He widened his eyes and looked at the dinosaur bone in front of him.

When was this bone left here?

If it was left behind from the dinosaur era, why was it so intact and brand new as if it had just died?

Although he was shocked, curious, and wanted to observe for a while, the two tentacles traumatized him greatly.

He had to leave quickly.

There was clearly an extremely terrifying creature hiding at the bottom of the lake\!

Perhaps there was more than one.

Seeing that the little elephant had already gone far, he did not dare to hesitate anymore. He immediately crawled out from the gap in the skeleton and quickly swam towards the shore.

Not long after he left, a huge black shadow slowly swam over from the depths of the lake not far away.

The dark bottom of the lake immediately turned pitch black.
