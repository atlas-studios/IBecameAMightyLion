Chapter 428: Untitled

Wolves were very patient animals.

Furthermore, he was absolutely obedient to the leader of the tribe.

Therefore, even if they had already realized this young lion's trick, they could only make mistakes and continue to stay here and surround this tree.

The alpha wolf felt extremely humiliated and was furious.

He knew that it was too late to return to find those prey.

He could only continue to guard the despicable lion on the tree and wait for it to fall down from exhaustion. Then, he could take revenge and fill his stomach.

His always prideful intelligence had been mercilessly crushed and he was completely flustered.

The entire wild deer quickly entered Chu Xiaoye and Catherine's stomachs.

Bloody internal organs and remaining bones were still hanging on the tree.

The wolves under the tree had already drooled for 3,000 feet and their necks were already a little stiff.

They secretly regretted their previous rashness and carelessness. They blamed their leader for his stupid orders in their hearts. As a result, the originally sumptuous dinner turned into nothingness and they could only watch helplessly as others ate with relish.

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, the internal organs of a wild deer fell from the tree.

The wolf pack guarding nearby immediately started fighting.

The alpha wolf was furious. It started to bite the companions who were snatching food mercilessly, and even tore the food from the other party's mouth.

Facing food, the unity of the wolf pack seemed to have become a little chaotic.

Chu Xiaoye started to add fuel to the fire. He threw down the remaining internal organs and the entire skeleton of the wild deer.

Hence, the hungry wolf pack was in chaos and started to fight for food crazily.

The alpha wolf swallowed a piece of internal organs and looked up. The two lions on the tree had long disappeared.

"Roar—"

An angry roar sounded in the dark forest.

It would never forget this hatred and humiliation\!

When Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine back to the pride's camp, Little Curly Tail and the others had already transported the prey back.

However, before he returned, no one ate first. More than ten prey were placed on the ground, intact.

This was the respect the pride had for the lion king.

It was not easy to make animals do this.

Chu Xiaoye was rather pleased and immediately instructed everyone to start eating.

There was plenty of food tonight and everyone could eat as they pleased.

Even the three warthogs started eating.

The wild deer's meat was tender, strong, and extremely delicious. To the human little girl, this was also a rare feast.

The little girl held a sharp knife and cut the deer meat piece by piece, eating with relish. Her two rows of pure white teeth were covered in blood, but she was already used to the stench. She only felt that it was sweet and delicious like delicacies.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and felt strange.

Ever since this human little girl followed the pride, she was already used to the habits of the pride. She did not brush her teeth, wash her face, or love hygiene. However, her two rows of small teeth were still as white as before. Her skin was also white and tender. She did not look like a wandering child who was exposed to the sun, rain, and dust.

Furthermore, ever since that time, she never fell sick again.

No matter how much rain and how much cold she suffered, she was still lively and full of energy.

Occasionally, she would jump down from the big black bear's back and walk by herself. She would also jump around, moving lightly through the forest. Her movements were rather agile and she was many times stronger than before.

It seemed that his saliva was very effective on this little girl.

However, he did not know if this change was good or bad for this little girl who could not escape her human identity no matter what.

Chu Xiaoye believed that one day, perhaps not long later, this little girl would still leave the pride and return to the human world.

After all, she was different from him.

She was a true human.

She could learn to adapt to the life of lions, but she could never become a true lion.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and guarded his companions who were eating.

Alisa, who was eating, looked up at him. The flames in her eyes were still quietly burning.

Suddenly, she instinctively felt a pair of cold eyes staring at her from somewhere, making her tremble. When she turned around to look, she happened to see Catherine's dark and cold eyes.

This seemed to be a silent warning and threat.

This female cub was indeed extraordinary\!

Not only was Alisa not afraid, she was also more interested in this pride and every member of the pride.

With such a pride and such a companion, she, Alisa, could realize her dreams and ambitions. Only then could she gallop through the grassland and rule the world\!

"Sister, wait\!"

Alisa gave her a frivolous look and raised her chin at her like a lion. "In the future, you and your king will become my harem\!"

She was not afraid that the female cub would know her ambition.

Because it was useless even if they knew. Who would believe her?

Even if that fellow would believe her, with his confidence, what would he do to her? At most, he would treat her as a joke and not even take her seriously.

She understood the strong confidence of these young lion kings too well.

Furthermore, she had not done anything. Neither had she done anything wrong.

Catherine ignored her and did not rush to tell on her. She walked calmly under the tree and lay down. She looked up at the figure above and narrowed her eyes.

No one could hurt him in front of her.

"Roar…"

After eating her fill, Belia, who was in heat, started to be restless again.

She seemed to be determined to violate the rules of nature and species. She wanted to use her leopard body to arouse the desire of a lion and live a happy life with this young and powerful lion shamelessly many times a day.

Her father could not control her anymore and would even secretly encourage her.

As for her younger sister, who had developed a little slower, she was embarrassed to be with her. Every time she saw her in heat, she would hide in the bushes shyly and secretly learn from the gaps in the leaves.

To be honest, her charming and sexy actions did make some males' hormones quickly increase and their mouths dry.

The cold father did not dare to look anymore. If he continued to look, he would lose all his face.

"This lion grinding little demon\!"

The other lions also turned their heads.

At the same time, everyone secretly looked at the figure on the tree and muttered in their hearts.

"Is the king not good enough, or is he developing?"

At this moment, no one cared about the difference in species between leopards and lions. After experiencing so many mutations, everyone had long broken through their previous thoughts and rules.

As long as he liked her, as long as he was aroused, as long as he had an instinctive desire, he would break free from some secular restrictions and restrictions. Do it\!

As if she sensed everyone's anticipation and encouragement, Belia's courage increased and she was in high spirits. She jumped to Chu Xiaoye's side again and stuck out her tongue as she twisted.

"Bang\!"

As expected, Chu Xiaoye slapped her again.

Belia fell to the ground and looked up, her eyes filled with tears and she was extremely sad.

The other members of the pride sighed secretly. The king was too heartless and never had mercy on the female lions. It was probably difficult for the pride to continue growing in the future.

At this moment, the cold father really wanted to roar, "Everyone, don't be afraid\! This King is still brave\! This King will not refuse this difficult and great mission\!"

Unfortunately, he knew that his selfless contribution was only wishful thinking.

No young female cub would let him contribute selflessly.

This was a tragedy.

The moon was very round tonight.

Although there was a layer of dense leaves, he could still see the round and white outline.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and raised his claws, wanting to touch it.

Be it humans or lions, this moon never changed.

For some reason, Chu Xiaoye suddenly missed the life of a human when he looked at the moon.

This was not a good omen.

He was a lion. He could think of prey, home, dead companions, enemies he wanted to encounter, young female lions he had seen, and even think of mating and harems. However, he could not think of humans.

This would make him and his pride doomed.

Humans would not let them integrate. Definitely not.

Forget humans, forget everything in the past, work hard and be a lion seriously. Fight for his ideals and the survival and reproduction of the pride. This was what a lion should really do.

Then, the first thing to do was to completely become a lion.

How could he be considered a true lion?

Eat meat and drink blood? Fight and roar?

Neither.

Only by mating and reproducing could a lion really have life.

This was a hurdle that was difficult to cross.

At least for Chu Xiaoye, it was difficult.

However, he still decided to try. At least he had to work hard to become a true lion.

The responsibility on his shoulders and the beating of his heart were telling him his true identity. He was a lion, a lion, the king of all the members here, and their future guardian angel\!

And he was not alone.

Then, what was there to be afraid of and hesitant about?

Close your eyes and do it\!

Couldn't a lion king do whatever he pleased in his life?

Whoever dared to not accept it, he would fight them\!

"Whoosh\!"

Blue, the male leopard, suddenly jumped over and looked unconvinced.

"..."

Chu Xiaoye shivered and felt a little guilty.

Speaking of which, why was he feeling guilty? He did not know himself. It was like a father's daughter pestering a handsome young man, and not only did the handsome young man not appreciate her kindness, he even kicked the young girl away. The young girl's father came to question him and the young man panicked.

"I really didn't do anything to your daughter, I swear\!"

Chu Xiaoye's expression at this moment seemed to be defending himself, but he looked a little guilty, as if he had already done something to this father's daughter. Otherwise, why would she always pester you?

However, Blue was clearly not here to question him.

Blue looked at him calmly for a long time. Then, he suddenly bulged his muscles and raised his pride to express his intentions domineeringly. "After following my daughter, I, Blue, am willing to sacrifice my life for you, fight the world, and conquer thousands of miles\!"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

Bru expressed his intentions and turned to leave without saying anything.

He only wanted to tell this young lion king personally that as a father, he still liked lipards and would never object to him mating with his daughter.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to tell him, "Uncle, then you have to charge forward and mate with a lioness first to set an example for me."

Chu Xiaoye had indeed decided to force himself to become a true lion, but his first test subject would definitely not be a leopard.

He found it difficult to even mate with lionesses, let alone leopards.

That was extremely difficult.

Chu Xiaoye ignored the male leopard's temptation and lowered his head, looking at the pride under the tree.

Since he had decided, there was no time to lose. If he said he would do it, he would do it. He did not want to wait lest his courage and determination disappear.

Then, who was the most suitable target?

Chu Xiaoye's gaze skipped Mei Mei, Molly, and the cold father's wives and concubines and landed on the other lionesses.

With his current prestige and authority in the pride, he did not need to say much. As long as he chose a target, he only needed to look at them to make the other party willing, obedient, and even follow him happily.

The night was a little quiet.

No one knew what he was thinking.

Belia, who had been slapped, also crawled into the bushes and went to sleep sadly.

After the other members of the pride ate and drank their fill, they each found a place and started to close their eyes to rest.

The climb during the day was very tiring. Tomorrow would still be very tiring, so he had to rest well.

No one would have thought that on this quiet night, their young king, the king who had always been rough and indifferent to females, would suddenly start preparing to choose a female lion to mate with.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze scanned the Jiela sisters and the six female lions. Just as he was hesitating, he suddenly saw a figure standing up and walking towards the forest at the back.

"I'll choose her\!"

Chu Xiaoye's eyes immediately lit up and he decided.

It was not easy to mate with someone familiar. It would be awkward if he succeeded, and it would be embarrassing if he did not succeed. He should try it on a female lion that was a little unfamiliar.

He did not dare to guarantee that he would definitely be able to abandon all human concerns and thoughts tonight.

Tonight was destined to be a contradictory, difficult, painful, and great moment. Regardless of whether he succeeded or not, he would keep it a secret for the time being to avoid unnecessary trouble.

After all, this handsome and powerful lion king was coveted by many females.

The night was very dark and the forest was very deep.

Chu Xiaoye hoped to complete this matter quietly.

He did not have the thick skin of the cold father who could be intimate with a lioness in front of everyone.

Chu Xiaoye quietly jumped down from the tree and followed the figure towards the forest at the back.

He looked back and happened to see Catherine raise her head under the tree, looking at him suspiciously and vigilantly with her dark eyes.

As if he had been caught cheating, Chu Xiaoye's face was burning with guilt, but he pretended to be calm and glared at her fiercely, telling her not to follow him. He wanted to go to the toilet.

Catherine lowered her head to show her obedience.

Chu Xiaoye left quickly.

When his figure merged into the night, Catherine looked up with a complicated gaze. After hesitating for a long time, she could not help but get up and quietly follow.

As long as it concerned the king's safety, she had always been agile in dealing with the king's orders and would not follow them 100%.

The lioness that had just joined the pride was not simple and had ulterior motives. Of course, she was not at ease letting the king go alone.

However, even Catherine did not realize that she had been silently hoping that the king had really gone to relieve himself and not secretly date the female lion.

Although she never had much hope and although she had always been very clear-minded about her position, deep in her heart, she also hoped that the king would only look at her.

This selfishness was not wrong for animals or humans.

Catherine followed and walked very lightly.

Chu Xiaoye followed and walked very lightly.

Alisa found a good spot to pee. As she peed, she thought about where to start to conquer this pride completely.

Obviously, the members of this pride admired and trusted that fellow very much. Even if she used her strength and schemes to defeat that fellow, the members of this pride would probably not submit to her.

Then, there was only one way to completely conquer that fellow\!

Be it threats, beatings, or temptation, as long as she dealt with that fellow first and made him submit first, the other members would naturally not have any problems.

However, that fellow looked a little difficult to deal with.

Over the past few days, she had been observing carefully, but she did not discover that fellow's especially obvious likes and weaknesses. She seemed to have no idea where to start.

However, she realized that that fellow was rather concerned about the little thing riding on the big black bear. Every time he encountered danger, he would first look at the little thing and secretly protect it.

Perhaps, she could test it from that direction.

As for that fellow's mother, father, and younger siblings, she could not touch them for the time being, lest she piss him off and end up shooting herself in the foot.

"Chi—"

After squeezing out the last bit of urine, Alisa swung her tail and prepared to return.

Right at this moment, a figure stepped on the mottled moonlight that sprinkled on the ground and walked out from behind the tree. He looked at her with a burning gaze. The golden mane on his neck was exceptionally conspicuous even at night.

"I was discovered?"

Alisa's heart skipped a beat, but her face was exceptionally calm. She looked at him inquiringly, calm and composed. "What's the matter?"

Chu Xiaoye's face was hot and he was flustered, but he pretended to be calm. "Yes, there's something."

Alisa narrowed her eyes and listened attentively. "Please speak."

Chu Xiaoye: "I want to mate with you."
