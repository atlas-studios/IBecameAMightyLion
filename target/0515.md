Chapter 515: Burning the Orcs

The orc bridge advanced quickly.

Chu Xiaoye could not let the beautiful elves idle either, or there would be more and more gossip.

He personally led the team and dug pits at the end of the canyon.

There were three consecutive long pits with a distance of two meters between them. At the bottom of each pit were five big barrels of fire oil, and the pits were not covered.

Fei'er, who was digging the pit, was very puzzled. She could not help but ask, "Lord Night, do we really not need to hide the trap when making traps? If the orcs see it, they will definitely not move forward."

Chu Xiaoye wiped the sweat on his forehead and suddenly slapped her butt with the shovel in his hand.

Fei'er was shocked. She let out a cry and immediately ran forward, almost falling into the trap that she had just dug. She pouted and said, "Lord Night, what are you doing?"

Chu Xiaoye rested with the shovel and said, "Did you see that? You know that there's a trap ahead, but you still can't help but run forward."

Fei'er pouted and slapped the soil on her butt. She frowned and thought carefully. Then, she suddenly realized something and jumped in joy. "Lord Night, I know\! When the orcs come, we'll rush down with our shovels and slap their butts, chasing them into the trap\! Lord Night is so smart\! Fei'er admires you\!"

"…"

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched as he looked at the tall and cute pink-haired girl in shock.

He finally understood that the elves had fallen into such a miserable state not because of the orcs, but because they were stupid\!

"There's actually a girl who's even more stupid than her\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at Denise and felt terrible.

Could he really defeat the orcs with such a group of idiots?

He was a little suspicious now.

"Lord Night, I heard from them that when we win this battle, you will propose to our queen, right?"

At this moment, the little girl, Lisa, who had jeered at him to marry the queen yesterday, asked curiously. Her face was filled with curiosity and excitement, and she seemed to approve and look forward to this marriage.

"Nonsense\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "Don't listen to their nonsense\! Your queen and I are innocent\!"

"But everyone says so. Furthermore, everyone hopes that Lord Night can propose to the Queen and marry her."

Lisa was a little disappointed.

This pure little elf treated this youth as the savior of the elves and raised him to a position equal to the queen.

Chu Xiaoye felt that this was very dangerous.

It was fine if they made a joke occasionally, but if it continued like this, he felt that a disaster might befall him.

Of course, he believed that the Queen would not be as cold and heartless as those monarchs in history. However, authority and status would always warn her and let her understand that she was the supreme king here and that no one could shake her position.

If he won the battle this time, Chu Xiaoye knew that his reputation in the elves might reach its peak, and he might even surpass the queen who had just ascended the throne a few days ago.

Anyone would have thoughts.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye was even more determined to leave.

"Then, Lord Night, if you're unwilling to marry the Queen, you can also propose to the Princess."

Lisa still did not give up because she felt that only when this Lord Night married and had children here would he stay here forever to protect them and the entire elf race.

Chu Xiaoye felt a little pain and explained patiently, "It's even more impossible for me to be with the princess. I'm her friend, a very good friend. Everyone, don't think too much."

Lisa hurriedly said, "Lord Ye, I'm not talking about Princess Annie. I'm talking about Princess Nalia. Princess Nalia has just turned 16 and has light blue hair like the sky. Furthermore, her hair changes color every year and can last for months every time. She's also very beautiful, as beautiful as Sister Denise. You can consider her."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and asked curiously, "You're saying that her hair can change color by itself? Every year?"

Lisa nodded and said enviously, "Yes, yes. Princess Nalia's hair is as beautiful as her. Everyone is envious of her."

Chu Xiaoye asked in confusion, "Why haven't I seen her?"

A sad expression appeared on Lisa's face. "Princess Nalia is accompanying the high priest in the city. Our high priest has spent all his energy and effort to bring Princess Annie back and has been unconscious for a long time. Princess Nalia is the high priest's disciple and has been accompanying her."

"High Priest?"

This was the second time Chu Xiaoye had heard this title.

Compared to the beautiful Princess Nalia, he was more willing to see the mysterious high priest who could summon Annie back. Perhaps, she really had some magic?

In the evening.

Queen Lanisi personally sent over exquisite cakes.

The three deep pits had been dug and the oil barrels were placed in. The entire trap was exposed and did not look like a trap.

Vilis, who had come with the Queen, could not help but complain, "It's so obvious. Who are you kidding?"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and took the honey pastry the Queen personally handed over. After eating a few mouthfuls, he looked at the Queen and said, "Your Majesty, we need more than ten skilled elves to guard the exit here. Furthermore, we also need to set up some archers on the city wall. There aren't too many. Seven to eight will be enough."

Lanisi nodded and said, "I've already given you my right as the queen. Just tell them."

Chu Xiaoye stuffed the pastry in his hand into his mouth and looked at the giant sword elf at the side.

Lanisi immediately understood and said, "You need Vilis?"

Vilis narrowed her eyes and looked at him. "Go ahead and say it. Don't be so wishy-washy. As long as you can kill those orcs, you can consider me your mount\!"

Now that more than ten thousand orcs had come, the situation was even more critical. All her hope was placed on this fellow. If she continued to be arrogant and care about face, she would not be worthy of being a member of the elves.

Chu Xiaoye smiled and looked at her. "There's no need to be a mount. Vilis, at that time, you'll be in charge of protecting Her Majesty and lure the orcs in with Her Majesty. Then, you'll guard the exit here with your people and not let any orc rush out alive. Of course, there are many orcs and they're very fierce. Some will definitely rush out. However, there's a city not far behind you. There will be archers on the city wall to help you."

Lanisi frowned and said, "Night, isn't this a little inappropriate? There are nearly twenty thousand orcs. Isn't it a little…"

Vilis gripped the hilt of her sword tightly and said without hesitation, "Don't worry, Your Majesty. I'll definitely guard this place\! As long as I'm still alive, I won't let an orc charge out\!"

The huge sword lolita had a determined expression and a determined gaze. Her small and delicate body suddenly emitted an aura that was as sharp as a sword. It did not seem to match her cute pink dress.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and explained, "Vilis, don't think too much. I'm not taking revenge for personal reasons. Other than you and the ten-over elves, there are also the three pits we just dug. These three pits will help you. However, you still have to be careful. If you really can't hold on, immediately climb up the hill from the side or retreat into the city."

At this point, he suddenly took a step forward and patted the huge sword loli's shoulder. He said gently, "We need to win, but we don't need to use your blood and lives to win. That kind of victory is not a victory. I hope that in this battle, none of us, more than 1,000 people, will die. Do you understand?"

Vilis looked at him with trembling eyes and said softly, "Yes."

"Alright, go and pick people yourselves. I'll take a look at the hill."

Chu Xiaoye waved at them and left with Catherine.

Denise and Fei'er still followed behind him.

Vilis stood in place and looked at his back in a daze. Her previous resentment seemed to have disappeared the moment the hand patted her shoulder.

"We need to win, but we don't need to use your blood and lives to win… That kind of victory is not victory…"

Queen Lanisi also stared blankly at the retreating figure and muttered.

"Lord Night is so good."

The little girl named Lisa did not hide the admiration and respect on her face.

She looked at the queen and said eagerly, "Your Majesty, Lord Night will always stay in our Elf Kingdom, right?"

Lanisi retracted her gaze and revealed a worried expression. She muttered, "Perhaps."

Seeing that the Queen was amiable, Lisa said boldly, "Your Majesty, I just told Lord Night to propose to you after this battle. I hope that Lisa's words won't anger Your Majesty."

Lanisi turned around and looked at her. After a moment of silence, she said, "What did he say?"

Lisa said disappointedly, "Lord Night said that he and Your Majesty are innocent and told Lisa not to talk nonsense."

After saying that, the little girl looked at her queen and said, "However, someone saw Lord Night kiss you yesterday. He even saw you sleeping with him holding hands."

Lanisi smiled and said, "Lord Night is right. Lord Night and I are indeed innocent. Lisa, what else did you say to Lord Night?"

Lisa sighed and said, "I also told Lord Night that if Lord Night is unwilling to propose to Your Majesty, you can propose to Princess Nalia. I really hope that Lord Night can stay in our elven race forever."

"Nalia?"

Lanisi was stunned for a moment before she revealed a thoughtful expression. "Then how did Lord Night answer?"

Lisa said in distress, "Lord Night did not answer. Lisa feels that he has only never seen Princess Nalia. If he did, he would definitely be willing to propose to her."

Lanisi's eyes flickered. After a while, she said softly, "He'll see her."

After the sky turned dark, another cold wind blew.

The silver moon in the sky appeared from time to time and dark clouds fluttered in the night sky.

Chu Xiaoye's mood became very bad again.

He was not sleepy. Under the protection of Denise and Fei'er, he came to the hill near the cliff. His eyes flickered with a golden light as he looked at the three bridges through the dark night.

The orcs seemed to be tireless and built day and night. They did not stop at all in the middle.

The three bridges were built very quickly and were about to reach the location of the previous destroyed bridge. They were only 200 meters away from the cliff here.

"How slow\! Can you repair it quickly? Do you want to take revenge?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the orcs who were working hard and complained anxiously on the hill.

From time to time, he would look up at the night sky and then at the three bridges.

In order to be safe and secret, Chu Xiaoye ordered all the elves. Therefore, there were no torches lit on the elves' side. The orcs could not see them on the bridge, but they could see the orcs from above.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the hill and thought for a while. He suddenly thought of doing this. Was it too quiet and extraordinary?

The orc army was about to arrive, but there was no movement on the elves' side. There was no one at the cliff, and it was dark everywhere. There were no torches.

Obviously, the situation was wrong. There was an ambush or some other trick.

If the orcs thought this way, they suddenly did not dare to advance anymore, or they did not dare to chase after the queen in a while. What should they do?

At the thought of this oversight, Chu Xiaoye immediately left the hill with the two elven girls and instructed all the elven archers to gather. Then, he let the elven soldiers light some torches at the edge of the cliff.

The burning flames lit up the dark cliff and also the long hair and slender bodies of the elven girls.

The orcs on the bridge immediately roared excitedly.

"Everyone, follow me and shout\!"

Chu Xiaoye ordered all the archers, then said loudly, "Defend our homes with your lives and never retreat\!"

Hence, all the female elves shouted in unison, "We swear to protect our home and never retreat\! We swear to protect our home and never retreat\!"

The impassioned cries of the girls facing death resounded throughout the two sides of the cliff and echoed in the canyon for a long time.

The other elven soldiers hiding on the hill on both sides and the warriors at the end of the valley immediately felt their blood boil and shouted.

Everyone thought that this time, this youth would really make them guard this canyon with their lives.

When Vilis, who was training the ten-odd elven soldiers at the end of the canyon, heard these cries, she immediately raised the sword in her hand and shouted loudly, impassioned.

However, they did not know that when they were shouting these words with their blood surging, the young elf suddenly said to the elven girls behind him, "We're only clearing our throats. Don't take it seriously. When the orcs are about to come over, we'll immediately run and return to the place I set up previously, understand?"

The expressions of fear for death and the hot blood in their hearts had yet to fade. When they heard him say this, they immediately opened their mouths and looked at him in shock.

Soon, the Queen rushed over with Vilis.

When the orcs on the bridge heard the cries of the elven girls, not only were they not afraid, they were even more excited and built the bridge in a frenzy.

"Have you changed your mind? Do you want to guard here?"

Lanisi walked over and asked with a grave expression.

Changing his plans at the last minute meant that his plans had changed.

Before Chu Xiaoye could answer, Fei'er, who was at the side, smiled and said, "Your Majesty, Lord Night asked us to shout and play. He said that when the orcs are about to come over, we'll run immediately and not guard here."

The Queen's expression froze and she could not help but laugh.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the dark night sky again and prayed in his heart. He hoped that God could help this group of pitiful elves once and not let it rain.

Fortunately, the night was calm.

After dawn, the three bridges built by the orcs were only 70 to 80 meters away.

The roars of the orc army became even louder and more excited.

Chu Xiaoye continued to shout with the elven girls, "We swear to protect our home\! We will never retreat\!"

At noon, the three bridges were about to reach the cliff here. When the orc army was already preparing to jump over impatiently, Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "Run\!"

Then, he fled with the elven girls at his fastest speed.

Queen Lanisi, Vilis, Loli, and the other fifteen elves were still standing at the entrance of the valley, close to the cliff, waiting for the orc army to go ashore.

"Is everyone afraid?"

The Queen asked softly.

"No\! Your Majesty\!"

Everyone answered in unison, gripping the sword in their hands tightly with determined gazes. Their young and beautiful faces were filled with expressions of facing death calmly.

The queen pulled out the sword at her waist and said with a sword-like gaze, "Then let's wait a while more and let the orcs come closer\!"

"Roar —"

Right at this moment, the orcs suddenly roared and jumped up from the three bridges. Then, they waved the weapons in their hands and their faces were ferocious. They rushed towards them like a tide\!

"Catch that red-haired elf\!"

"I want that fierce little loli\! I love loli\!"

The orcs were extremely excited and their eyes were red. They rushed over with all their might like hungry wolves fighting for food.

"Run\!"

When the orc army was only thirty meters away, Queen Lanisi immediately turned around and fled with the elven girls.

"Chase—"

The orc army was like an overflowing flood that instantly filled the canyon. They squeezed and chased after the ten-over beautiful female elves.

They were very fast, but the female elves were even more agile. They chased each other and soon reached the middle of the canyon.

From the three bridges to the middle of the canyon, they were densely packed with orcs.

The elves hiding on both sides of the hill watched until their hair was numb and they were terrified. They started to wonder if they could really win this war.

"Whoosh\!"

An arrow flew out of the orc army at the front and hit the thigh of an elf girl running at the back.

The elven girl staggered and fell to the ground.

The elf girl in front was about to support her when another arrow shot over and flew past her face, scaring her.

The elven girl who had fallen to the ground immediately pulled out the dagger at her waist and shouted, "Don't care about me\! Run\!"

Vilis suddenly rushed back from the front and grabbed the clothes on her chest, lifting her onto another shoulder.

The giant sword elf carried a sword on one shoulder and a person on the other. She actually walked as if she was flying and soon ran in front.

The orc chasing behind shouted excitedly, "What a strong little loli\! Hahaha, I want this fierce little loli\! Don't snatch her from me\!"

"Bastard\! Don't shoot\! The elves are all soft and tender. Don't shoot them bad\!"

The orcs were extremely excited. They roared and chased, not shooting anymore.

Lanisi brought more than ten elves and continued to run, maintaining a distance of dozens of meters from the orc army behind.

The elves hiding on the hill were terrified and anxious. They looked at the youth hiding behind the rock and hoped that he would give the order quickly. The queen was already in danger.

The fire dragon Dolma was circling in the night sky, looking down at the ground with its sharp eyes. The fiery red figure was reflected in its golden eyes.

When Lanisi was about to run to the end of the canyon with the elven girls, Dolma suddenly swooped down and landed in the open space outside the city. It spread its wings and revealed its huge body.

"Jump\!"

When they ran in front of the three pits Chu Xiaoye and his men dug, Lanisi took the lead and jumped up.

The other elven girls also jumped up agilely like agile deer.

After three consecutive leaps, they left the canyon.

Queen Lanisi did not stop and immediately ran towards Dolma, who was waiting for her.

Originally, the mission Chu Xiaoye gave her was to let the fire dragon Dolma burn the three bridges by itself. However, Lanisi knew that this mission was very important, so she decided to ride the fire dragon and complete the mission together.

When she rode Dolma into the night sky, Vilis suddenly stopped outside the canyon with the ten-over elves. She turned around and held the sword in her hand tightly, waiting for the densely packed orc army that was roaring like the tide behind.

The girls' faces were pale, but their eyes were determined. They looked at death calmly\!

Vilis held the hilt of her sword with both hands, bent slightly, and started to accumulate strength.

"Defend with your life and never retreat\!"

She suddenly shouted.

The ten-over female elves also held their swords and said in unison, "Defend to the death and never retreat\!"

They would use their blood and life, swords, and courage to protect this place\!

When the orc army was only twenty meters away and about to rush out of the canyon, the calm and cold voice of the young elf suddenly came from the hill on the right. "Fire\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Just as he finished speaking, more than ten sharp arrows burning with flames suddenly flew out from both sides of the hill. They did not shoot at the ferocious orcs, but at the three mud pits on the ground in front of them.

"Boom\! Boom\! Boom\!"

The three pits suddenly ignited with flames at the same time\!

Then, like a roaring behemoth, the flames suddenly jumped out of the ground and extended into three burning walls\!

The orcs at the front were terrified when they saw this scene. They hurriedly wanted to stop, but it was already too late. They could not stop themselves and their companions, who were sprinting behind them, could not stop either.

They did not have the time to jump and fell into the pit. Before they could jump out, they let out extremely miserable cries and their bodies were instantly lit up.

However, before they could die immediately, they immediately crawled out of the pit with miserable cries and pounced at their companions behind them, shouting for help.

As for their companions, they were terrified by this scene and cried out endlessly. They hurriedly retreated to dodge.

Hence, the orcs at the front immediately fell into chaos. Firemen rolled around on the ground and ran in fear in the beast crowd.

Right at this moment, wooden barrels full of fire oil suddenly rolled down from the hill on both sides. Just as they landed in the orc crowd, they were lit up by the burning orcs. With a bang, flames jumped up.

Hence, at the end of the canyon, other than the three burning fire walls, more flames burned.

"Ah —"

"Ah —"

The orcs' miserable screams were exceptionally loud in the canyon in the night.

The excited orc army finally sensed the situation in front of them and hurriedly stopped advancing.

However, at the entrance of the canyon, the orc army following at the back was about to turn around when more wooden barrels that were filled with kerosene suddenly rolled down from the hill on both sides. Then, a dense rain of arrows with flames fell and lit up the oil barrels with a bang.

Hence, the ground at the entrance of the canyon was also drowned by the terrifying sea of flames.

Chu Xiaoye had prepared more kerosene at the entrance. At this moment, it was rolling down the hill on both sides endlessly, forming a sea of flames more than ten meters long.

Any orc who wanted to retreat from here was delusional\!

Nearly twenty thousand orcs had already entered the canyon. At this moment, they were suddenly blocked inside. There was a sea of flames and miserable cries at both ends of the canyon.

With Chu Xiaoye's orders, the wooden barrels filled with kerosene on both sides of the hill in the middle of the canyon started to roll down. Then, rockets rained and the ground of the entire canyon erupted with burning big people.

The orcs' miserable cries almost shook the mountains on both sides\!

The elves hiding on the hill on both sides turned pale and terrified when they saw this terrifying scene.

Even if the other party was an enemy and they wanted to kill them all, they could not accept this terrifying and desperate scene with their own eyes.

It was too terrifying\!

At this moment, they finally believed what the young elf said. The elves would definitely win this battle\!

At the end of the valley, behind the three fire walls, Vilis stood there in a daze with more than ten elves holding swords. Her white face was illuminated by the flames until it was red and her face was filled with shock and fear.

They originally thought that these orcs would rush over and they would risk their lives to stop the orc army, but they never would have thought that it would be this outcome\!

At this moment, Vilis looked at the three fire walls that were dancing like devils and finally understood what that fellow said.

"Other than you and a dozen elves, there are also the three pits we just dug. These three pits will help you."

At that time, she could not understand and did not know what it meant.

But now, she finally understood.

She raised her head, wanting to cross the flames to look at the face and see if she could find it.

"Ah —"

At this moment, an orc covered in flames suddenly rushed out of the sea of fire. He howled miserably and rushed towards them crazily.

Vilis grabbed the sword hilt and rushed up like the wind. With a spin, the sword in her hand brought with it a circle of cold light and cut off the orc's head.

Blood sprayed and the orc fell to the ground, dying completely.

Vilis looked down at the corpse of the orc that had its head cut off and was already badly burned. She thought to herself that perhaps this orc had run out with all his might and deliberately came to die.

Who could tolerate the burning of flames?

It was better to die immediately than to struggle like hell.

"Ah —"

Another few orcs with flames burning all over their bodies rushed out. The weapons in their hands had long fallen to the ground, and they let out terrified and desperate cries.

They had just rushed out when they fell to the ground and rolled around in pain.

Vilis brought the elven girls up and helped them relieve their pain.

At this moment, the admiration these dozen or so elf girls had for the young man was indescribable. Even this situation was planned in advance. What kind of intelligence was this\!

Orcs whose bodies were on fire passed the three fire walls and rushed out. They were all killed by their swords.

Before this, when they were chosen, they thought that the mission was difficult and sacrifices were inevitable. They had already decided to die. They never would have thought that their mission would be so simple, so simple that it was a little cruel and boring.

"You guys guard, I'll go up the hill."

Vilis did not want to kill these doomed orcs anymore and prepared to help on the hill.

The orcs that were being roasted by the flames in the canyon were charging crazily towards the hills on both sides, as if they wanted to die together with the elves on them.

However, not only were there archers and elven soldiers, there was also more kerosene. Hence, their corpses quickly piled up the hill on both sides and the canyon below.

Just as Vilis was about to leave, an elven girl hurriedly said, "Lady Vilis, the Queen said that we have to listen to Lord Night's orders. Lord Night ordered us to guard here. If you leave, you will be disobeying his orders."

Right at this moment, a tall orc suddenly ran out naked. Although his body was roasted black, his life force was still strong. He roared and rushed towards them.

Vilis' expression changed. She immediately swung her huge sword and jumped up. Like a rapidly spinning hurricane, she floated past the tall orc's neck.

"Pfft\!"

Blood sprayed and the orc's head fell to the ground.

Vilis looked forward. The three fire walls had already started to weaken. It was not that there was not enough oil inside, but there were too many orc corpses. They were continuously piled in there, suppressing the flames and giving the other orcs behind them a chance to escape.

Vilis was secretly shocked. She hurriedly tightened her grip on the sword in her hand and guarded the ground with a grave expression. She had no intention of leaving again.

"Lord Night is so smart. You thought of everything."

The other female elves could not help but sigh.

Vilis' face turned red, which accentuated her stupidity and childishness.

"How did that fellow's head grow?"

She was secretly puzzled.

On the other side, at the entrance of the canyon.

The terrified and desperate orcs, who had nowhere to run, also started to rush towards the sea of fire behind them one after another, wanting to rush out of the canyon and rush up the bridge.

At this moment, the elven queen, Lanisi, was riding the fire dragon Dolma and spitting fire at the three bridges.

The bridge had just been built and was covered in damp trees. There was even snow on it and it was difficult to burn.

Dolma sprayed out a lot of flames before burning one of the bridges.

Just as Lanisi was commanding Dolma to burn another bridge, a team of twenty orcs suddenly climbed up the bridge from the opposite cliff and ran over hurriedly.

They were the soldiers guarding the camp of the orc army. When they saw that the situation did not seem right, they hurriedly ran over to check.

Unexpectedly, they happened to see the Elven Queen riding a fire dragon and burning their bridge\!

The twenty-over orcs were shocked and furious. They hurriedly held their weapons and rushed up the bridge.

"Whoosh\!"

One of the orcs was exceptionally tall and strong. He held a huge bow and shot out an arrow from 200 meters away\!

The arrow pierced through the air with a whoosh and actually pierced through Dolma's thick scales and into its wings\!
