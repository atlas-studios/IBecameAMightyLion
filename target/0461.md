Chapter 461: Untitled

"Roar—"

The roar of the lion declaring its territory sounded in the pride.

This should have been Chu Xiaoye's doing, but Chu Xiaoye felt that it was too silly to do so. Therefore, he handed the mission to the cold father.

The cold father was already familiar with such roars and naturally could not ask for more.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and patrolled the bushes, scaring away many small animals. Then, he walked out of the bushes and came to the grassland.

Without the cover of the huge tree, the grassland was bright and sunny.

The cold father's hoarse and rough roar sounded one after another and spread to the surrounding grassland.

If this territory did have an owner or other prides, they would definitely run over with a murderous aura after hearing the cold father's roar and prepare to expel them.

However, when they walked more than ten kilometers away, other than the panicked herbivores, they did not encounter any other pride or other carnivores.

This was strange.

This grassland was lush, had abundant food and resources, and was adjacent to the river. Logically speaking, it was a superb survival territory.

With doubts, Chu Xiaoye continued forward with the pride.

The cold father's roar started to sound a little weak and his throat became even hoarse.

"Roar—"

The Blue Eyes immediately connected and a low and dignified roar spread throughout this territory.

Unexpectedly, just as this roar fell, the angry roar of another lion suddenly sounded not far ahead. Then, the roars of a few lions rose and fell, charging over with a murderous aura.

It turned out that this grassland was indeed occupied by lions. However, for some reason, this pride's camp was rather far from the bushes with super huge trees. They did not even encircle the bushes as their territory.

Because there was no mark left by a lion there.

The cold father's roar just now did not seem to have attracted their attention. Clearly, they did not take the cold father seriously and thought that he was just a reckless clown. Only when the roar of Blue Eyes sounded did they become vigilant. It turned out that there was not only one invader.

A lion had a very sharp judgment of its own kind or competitors. From the other party's roar, it could roughly understand the other party's strength and age.

The things that Blue Eyes displayed clearly made them afraid.

The current Blue Eyes was almost two meters high and his body was strong. The scars on his face and his blind eyes full of fierce meat made him look fierce and extremely terrifying. Ordinary lions would be terrified at a glance and flee at the sight of him.

The cold father felt that he had been attacked. He had roared all the way here with all his might, but he did not get any response. Furthermore, the other party had lured the enemy out with a random sound.

This was the difference.

He had to admit that his position in the pride was no longer as glorious as before.

"Sigh, the hero is past his prime and the lion is old\!"

Of course, he was currently in his prime and was still very early to become old and weak. However, the difference between this period and the past made him feel that he was already old and useless.

Fortunately, no one disliked him, and the two unfilial sons did not have the intention to chase him out of the pride.

Then, he should work hard and become stronger and useful\!

The cold father would never be a cowardly lion\!

"Roar—"

The cold father roared angrily and rushed out first\!

He wanted all the members behind him, especially the two unfilial sons, to understand that he was still strong and brave. He was still the majestic lion king that had once shaken the grassland\!

The enemy finally appeared\!

Eight huge lions brought a group of female lions. There were about thirty female lions, and every one of them was about his size. They looked even more majestic and domineering.

As for the eight lions, their shoulders were more than two meters tall. They could be described as giant lions\!

"Roar—"

The lion brought the lionesses and the lionesses rushed over with the cubs\!

The battle to chase away the invaders did not seem to be just the responsibility of the lion here. Be it the female lions or the young cubs, they were all united and fought side by side\!

Although the cold father was afraid, he did not give in. He still gathered his courage and roared as he rushed forward, but his steps suddenly slowed.

As he roared, he looked back. The two unfilial sons and the blue-eyed brothers were very fast. They would charge in front every time they fought. This time, they would definitely leave him in the back before he approached the enemy. This way, not only would he have face and honor, he would also be safe. Why not?

However, when he turned around, reality slapped him hard\!

Not only did the members of the pride not follow behind him and charge bravely, they actually turned around and fled under the lead of his unfilial son\!

They fled\!\!\!

"Roar—"

The eight lions brought the pride and roared like thunder, charging over with a murderous aura.

The cold father almost peed his pants in fear. He hurriedly stopped in his tracks and turned to escape. As he ran, he roared, "Unfilial son\! Wait for me\!"

Fortunately, his current speed was no longer the same as before. In his extreme fear and anger, his four hooves flew as he ran very quickly. Soon, he caught up to the pride and the roar in his mouth turned into a roar. "Coward\! You're all cowards\!"

Unfortunately, no one bothered with him.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and ran not quickly. As he fled, he looked back.

The pride behind seemed to be afraid after seeing their team. They did not dare to chase too quickly and kept chasing and roaring more than ten meters behind them. They seemed to be avoiding a battle and only wanted to chase them out.

"Why did you escape?"

This was the question of the cold father and the other members of the pride.

However, although everyone was puzzled, they trusted Chu Xiaoye's orders and judgment.

When they were still a thousand meters away from the bushes with super huge trees, the pride of natives chasing behind suddenly stopped and stopped chasing.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and immediately stopped.

Indeed, there were secrets in the bushes that made these ferocious beasts afraid.

The reason why he ran was to try and see if this pride would chase him all the way to the bushes. Now, it seemed that the other party was clearly afraid of something and did not dare to continue forward.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the super tree.

The canopy had already hidden into the clouds and was so high that it was impossible to see. The branches that spread out below extended for a thousand meters, like countless huge arms that covered the bushes at the bottom. They were really powerful\!

The wind blew and the leaves swayed. The dew on them fluttered and fell like rain. The sun was as white as snow and fell piece by piece, as if the emperor's grace was vast, the sun was shining, and the rain was pouring.
