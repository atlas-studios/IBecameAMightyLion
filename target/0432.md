Chapter 432: Paradise

It's coming closer\!

The pleasant scent was getting closer and closer\!

The enemies seemed to have slowed down.

At the same time, many foreign scents appeared in the forest ahead.

Chu Xiaoye had no time to take another look at that lush grassland under the mountain. He instead focused his attention and looked forward.

The sun shone down and the fog dispersed.

The thing in front of him became extremely clear.

The blue sky, the ancient and mysterious primitive forest, the crisp and mellow cries of birds, the colorful butterflies, and the colorful wild flowers. Every single one of them emitted an unfamiliar aura of a new world.

A big bird flew overhead and cast a shadow with a tail. It disappeared in the blink of an eye.

The towering trees beside him were all as thick and tall as iron towers. No one knew how long they had lived here.

A wild rabbit was shocked by the running pride and suddenly jumped more than ten meters away. It turned around and revealed two sharp teeth and a pair of malicious eyes.

In the forest that flashed past, there was a huge spider web hanging on it. A strong monkey was bound on it, and a colorful giant spider the size of a squirrel slowly crawled over.

Everything in front of him reminded Chu Xiaoye that danger was everywhere here\!

Mei Mei's aura was even closer and was a mile away.

After shaking off the clouds, the pride had the strength to protect themselves. Chu Xiaoye suddenly accelerated and took the lead to chase.

Catherine was like a whirlwind that followed closely and did not fall too far behind.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly jumped down from the tree above and landed behind them.

Then, more figures jumped down from the tree one after another, blocking their retreat and quickly surrounding them.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and still rushed forward. He jumped and landed in a forest.

Under a huge tree that was as thick as a pillar that supported the sky, stood a bald lion. Behind it, the roots of the huge tree had been dug into a deep cave. Mei Mei lay at the entrance of the cave motionless.

On both sides of the bald lion stood a pair of tall and strong gorillas that were three meters tall. Like two iron tower guards, they surrounded the bald lion on the left and right.

The surrounding forest roared endlessly, and a large group of lions and female lions rushed out with a murderous aura. There were also some gorillas and a few strong jaguars who revealed cold eyes on the thick tree.

There were even a few thick pythons that wrapped around the tree like vines. They raised their heads and spat out scarlet tongues, revealing their ferocious faces.

Strangely, these animals of different species seemed to have become a team that listened to the bald lion.

The bald lion looked ordinary and was not too big. However, the fur on its body was very sparse. Its four legs looked even longer and stronger than that of an ordinary lion. Other places did not look different.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and observed carefully. He could not see through the strength of this bald lion.

Mei Mei lay in front of the tree hole and moved her body, but she did not wake up.

Chu Xiaoye no longer hesitated. With a whoosh, he rushed over and pounced at the bald lion.

The bald lion stood there and did not move. It did not even look at him. Instead, it looked at Catherine, who was behind him, and revealed a very interesting expression.

"Boom\!"

A huge fist suddenly smashed at Chu Xiaoye from the side\!

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws to face it. With a bang, he was sent flying by a huge force.

He did not land on the ground. Instead, he used the force to fly towards another gorilla. He swung his golden claw and grabbed its head\!

When the second gorilla saw this, it immediately roared angrily and raised its huge fist to smash over\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

The second gorilla's huge fist was cut in half by the sharp golden claw\!

"Roar—"

A miserable and furious roar resounded through the forest\!

Chu Xiaoye did not seem to be prepared to let it go. As soon as he landed on the ground, he tip-toed and pounced at it again.

Seeing that his brother was in danger, the first gorilla immediately roared and chased after him. It suddenly jumped and pounced like a small mountain. It was faster and arrived first\!

Unexpectedly, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and grabbed its face\!

The gorilla was shocked, but it was not flustered. It raised its fist and smashed it fiercely.

"Chi—"

A chill suddenly flashed across its abdomen\!

The gorilla looked down and saw a female cub passing by him\!

"Whoosh\!"

Blood sprayed and internal organs splashed\!

Before the gorilla could react, its body turned limp and it fell from the sky. With a bang, it fell heavily to the ground and rolled with a miserable scream.

It was actually cut open\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and pounced at the crippled gorilla again.

Catherine, who had succeeded in her sneak attack, flashed towards Mei Mei in front of the tree hole. Like a breeze, she rushed close with a whoosh.

However, before she could save him, a strong wind suddenly roared beside her. The bald lion was as fast as a ghost and hit her body with its head. Before Catherine could react, she flew out diagonally and fell to the ground in a sorry state. Her entire body was in pain and she was dizzy.

"Whoosh\!"

The bald lion rushed up again at lightning speed and suddenly slapped her head.

Catherine hurriedly rolled on the ground and dodged it. Then, she turned around and got up.

Unexpectedly, she jumped up from the ground and the bald lion hit her again like a cannonball. With a bang, it hit her head.

Catherine flew out and blacked out.

The bald lion landed in front of her, grinned, and revealed a hint of desire and greed. It turned around, curled its tail, wrapped it around Catherine's neck, and dragged her to Mei Mei's side.

Then, the bald lion looked at the golden-clawed lion king.

When Catherine lured the bald lion away, Chu Xiaoye's golden claw had already pierced into the neck of the right-handed crippled gorilla and cut off its neck.

At this moment, he gave the gorilla a fatal blow. He clenched his golden claws and punched through the other party's chest with a bang, shattering his heart\!

The gorilla did not have the time to scream before it fell to the ground and died completely\!

As for the gorilla whose stomach had been cut open by Catherine, it also died after struggling for a while on the ground\!

Although these two giant gorillas were astonishingly strong, their reactions were too slow. In the blink of an eye, they had already fallen into a pool of blood and died.

The other animals in the surrounding forest pounced at the pride that had rushed over.

Little Curly Tail's tail let out a deafening roar. Blood splashed and limbs flew.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze collided with the bald lion.

Beside the corner of the bald lion's mouth, two crystal whiskers suddenly lit up, causing its already dark and terrifying face to appear even more sinister and demonic.

"Whoosh\!"

The bald lion was the first to attack. Using its head as a weapon, its entire body was like a high-speed cannonball that fiercely collided with Chu Xiaoye\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and flew over its head, charging towards Mei Mei and Catherine in front of the tree hole.

"Boom\!"

The bald lion's head hit a towering tree in front of it heavily, causing a big hole in the thick tree trunk\!

The entire tree swayed violently.

Before Chu Xiaoye could rush close to the tree hole, the bald lion suddenly flew over at an even faster speed and rushed behind Chu Xiaoye in the blink of an eye.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and suddenly flicked his golden claw. He did not dodge or stop and swung it at his head\!

However, the sharp golden claws did not pierce the bald lion's head. Before Chu Xiaoye could react, the bald lion's rapidly flying body hit him heavily with a bang\!

Chu Xiaoye flew out and passed Mei Mei and Catherine on the ground. With a bang, he smashed heavily into the deep tree hole. His entire body was embedded into the wall of the tree hole\!

An intense pain suddenly assaulted him\!

All the bones in his body let out cracking sounds\!

His internal organs were seriously injured\!

Chu Xiaoye vomited blood and immediately felt dizzy. His vision turned black and he almost fainted.

This scene happened to be seen by Catherine, who had woken up.

Catherine struggled and wanted to jump up, but she realized that she was still dizzy and weak.

"Whoosh\!"

The bald lion rushed over her head and its hard head suddenly hit the top of the tree hole\!

The roots of the huge tree swayed violently and suddenly collapsed. With a bang, the entire tree suddenly shortened and buried the entire tree hole below\!

However, the huge tree did not collapse. It relied on the other thick roots that had pierced into the ground beside it and still stood steadily\!

Chu Xiaoye could not resist at all and was suppressed under this towering tree, instantly disappearing.

Catherine trembled as she slowly stood up.

At this moment, Mei Mei also woke up slowly, but she did not know what was happening.

The bald lion turned around and looked at them coldly, the corner of its mouth revealing the pride of a victor.

Under his impact, the golden-clawed lion king's bones had long broken and its internal organs were broken. It had lost its life force and was buried at the bottom of the giant tree. Even its corpse could not be seen.

Then, these two young and beautiful female lions would naturally belong to him.

The bald lion raised its head and looked at the members of the pride who were still fighting. The corner of its mouth split open as it chose one by one. Only those chosen by him could survive\!

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine suddenly swung her sharp silver claws and pounced at him.

However, their speed and strength were greatly reduced.

The heavy injury just now still had not recovered.

A hint of ridicule appeared in the bald lion's eyes. It did not do anything else. It raised its claws and pressed down, pressing Catherine in front of it.

Catherine lay on the ground and looked blankly at the roots of the huge tree behind him. Her four claws were scratching the ground with all her might, trying to climb over.

Even if she died, she had to die with the king.

She was his shadow. Then, she should be buried there with him.

The bald lion pressed her neck. Seeing that she did not even look at him at this moment, jealousy and anger immediately appeared in its eyes. It suddenly roared angrily and its sharp claws pierced into her neck with a whoosh, letting out an angry roar.

"Since you won't submit to This King, die\!"

Catherine's gaze was fearless. She was still lying there, looking straight ahead, at him, who would never disappear from her vision.

"Boom —"

Just as the bald lion's sharp claws were about to pierce her neck, the roots of the giant tree suddenly exploded\!

Then, black smoke sprayed out and spread in all directions with a powerful storm. It actually shook the towering tree and it fell\!

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly lit up in the black smoke, like a meteor that illuminated the night\!

Before the bald lion could see clearly, it suddenly felt a chill on its left leg and was shocked. With a whoosh, it quickly jumped away\!

However, he was still a step too late.

The left leg pressing on Catherine's neck left his body and flew out amid the spraying blood\!

At this moment, the bald lion, who had landed in the distance, felt an intense pain\!

He staggered and almost fell to the ground.

"Boom\!"

The huge tree trembled and finally fell to the ground.

Black smoke spewed out from the giant tree’s roots and quickly spread, instantly enveloping Mei Mei and Catherine.

Two green lights flickered in the bald lion's eyes. Its green eyes, which could penetrate the dense clouds on the mountaintop, could not penetrate the black smoke at this moment.

"Ugh —"

Not only did he not see clearly in the black smoke, he even accidentally inhaled some black smoke and vomited on the spot.

"Whoosh\!"

The golden light appeared again\!

The bald lion instinctively jumped up and jumped onto the trunk of the huge tree that had fallen to the ground\!

Even though he had lost a leg, he was still as agile as before\!

The mountain wind blew and black smoke quickly dispersed.

However, wherever the black smoke passed, there were sounds of vomiting.

The animals that were fighting the pride were caught off guard by the black smoke. One second, they were extremely fierce, but the next second, their vision blurred and they were dizzy. They lay on the ground and vomited.

Hence, the members of the pride who were already immune to the black smoke and were prepared immediately took the opportunity to counterattack.

The bald lion stood on the tree trunk and let out an angry roar. It looked viciously at the young lion that was gradually appearing from the black smoke.

"He's actually not dead\!"

A circle of golden mane finally grew on Chu Xiaoye's neck and his size suddenly increased\!

After the broken bones quickly healed, his body mutated again\!

"Roar—"

A deafening terrifying roar suddenly erupted from his throat\!

A visible sound wave quickly surged forward like a tidal wave and slapped the bald lion heavily, sending him flying\!

The bald lion's vision turned black and blood flowed from its mouth and nose. It was dizzy and almost fainted\!

Fortunately, he was strong and reacted quickly. He immediately held his breath and took the initiative to close his ears to cover his two ear holes\!

Just as he was about to land and bite his teeth to retaliate, Chu Xiaoye suddenly rushed in front of him with a puff and was indescribably fast\!

"Whoosh\!"

The sharp golden claw suddenly slashed at his head\!

The bald lion originally did not have the time to react and was shocked. He thought that he would definitely die. At this moment, seeing that the golden claw was actually aimed at his head, his heart immediately turned from shock to joy and he thought to himself, Idiot\!

His head was not made of mud\!

His head could even shatter rocks\! He could forget about any sharp claws…

"Chi—"

With a light sound, the sharp golden claw pierced into his head\!

The bald lion suddenly extended its claws that were preparing to counterattack and instantly froze in front of Chu Xiaoye\!

"Crack\!"

The hard head that could even break rocks was cut in half.

Scarlet blood surged out.

The bald lion fell to the ground with a thud and died completely\!

A strange heat floated out of the bald lion's blood and took the initiative to enter Chu Xiaoye's sharp golden claws. Then, it merged with his blood and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye's amber eyes first flickered with two golden lights, then two green lights, and finally, they recovered.

He did not obtain the other party's most powerful collision skill by killing this bald lion. What he obtained was the ability for his eyes to see through the clouds, causing him to be able to see very far, be it in the dark night or in the lingering clouds.

The battle in the surrounding forest was already approaching its end.

The ground was filled with corpses. Only a few lions and female lions were still resisting stubbornly. The few vigilant jaguars and some gorillas had long fled.

Mei Mei recovered her strength and immediately rushed over to join the battle.

Soon, the last few lions fell into a pool of blood and died loyally for their lion king.

It could not be denied that this was a powerful team. It was the most difficult and dangerous team they had encountered since crossing the mountains.

Fortunately, victory still belonged to them.

Chu Xiaoye had also mutated again and became stronger on the verge of death.

Catherine slowly walked behind him and lowered her head, silently becoming his shadow again, as if she had never left.

No matter how desperate, painful, and how much she wanted to die with him previously, all these emotions were quietly hidden and no one saw them.

Chu Xiaoye quickly walked towards the pride.

The cold father was injured, but it was not serious. He only had some scars on his body.

The Jiela sisters were seriously injured, and only two of their six sisters were left. The other four were already lying on the ground covered in blood and had stopped breathing.

Every member was injured and looked miserable.

The first wave of enemies in this forest taught them a good lesson. They knew that this was not elsewhere and was different from the places they had passed previously.

This would be an even more dangerous, ancient, and mysterious place\!

The huge, thick, and tall trees with almost no canopy were twisted like pythons. The ancient withered vines that meandered for miles were several meters tall, the huge bushes with leaves like roofs, and the huge, bright flowers that looked like they were full of scarlet fangs.

All of this was different from the primitive forest they had seen in the past.

The creatures here, be it plants or animals, had clearly evolved to an unbelievable and terrifying degree.

Perhaps, they should not have stepped here rashly.

However, how could he be willing to give up so easily after crossing mountains and rivers to come here?

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto an ancient tree and looked up. He saw the vast and endless grassland again.

A river was like a long dragon winding around the green grassland. The upper reaches of the river seemed to lead to the distant majestic snow mountain that entered the clouds, but its tail extended to an unknown place.

Although they were too far away to see the animals on the grassland, Chu Xiaoye knew that there must be a large number of herbivores gathered on this grassland.

From the birds in the sky and the extraordinary team they encountered, it could be seen.

"Ga —"

Suddenly, an ear-piercing cry came from the sky above.

Then, a huge shadow covered the clouds and quickly passed by.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and was shocked to discover that there was a strong zebra grabbed by the giant bird's claws. Furthermore, there was a lizard-like tail dragging behind the giant bird\!

"Pterodactyl?"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and thought that he had seen it wrongly. He blinked and wanted to take a closer look, but he realized that the giant bird had flashed and disappeared long ago.

Impossible\!

How could it be a dinosaur?

It was very possible that some birds had mutated like animals and that was why they looked like this.

This explanation made sense.

However, for some reason, the dinosaur skeleton he had seen at the bottom of the lake suddenly appeared in Chu Xiaoye's mind.

Could it be that the dinosaurs were not really extinct but were hiding somewhere humans had never set foot in?

Humans were indeed very impressive and could use tools to tour many places on Earth. However, there were still many places on Earth that humans had never stepped foot in.

For example, some mysterious places at the bottom of the sea, underground, and some which could interfere with radars and confuse electrons and eyes.

Perhaps what you saw was the first mountain. When you went over, you realized that you were on the second mountain. You thought that this was the mountain you saw. Actually, the first mountain had always been there. You could see it but could not go. Sometimes, you could not even see it.

Perhaps, the world in front of Chu Xiaoye was a place humans could never reach.

Of course, the little girl riding the big black bear was an exception.

If there was really such a land that isolated humans, then no matter how dangerous it was, even if there were dinosaurs, Chu Xiaoye was willing to bring the pride here to take root, germinate, bloom, and reproduce.

Even if they had to pay a heavy price.

The sky was blue, the ground was green, the air was fresh, the water was clean, and the food was safe.

This was enough.
