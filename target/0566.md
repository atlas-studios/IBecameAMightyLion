Chapter 566: Riot

"No, I'm not going out\!"

Qin Mo stood in place and wiped her tears. There was a red slap mark on her face and she stubbornly refused to leave.

"Young Master Chu, what do you mean?"

Yang Shaoqing quickly calmed down and said with a cold face, "We came to make friends with you out of kindness and invited you and your friends to go out and play. What do you mean by hitting someone? Are you looking down on us?"

Mo Ziqi sneered and said, "Young Master Chu, it's true that you're talented. However, in this Suhang City, talent does not mean that you can do whatever you want\!"

Chu Xiaoye stood at the door and suddenly smiled. "Then, what do you think I should do?"

Mo Ziqi thought that this youth was afraid and immediately said with a smile, "We're all friends. Why do you have to be like this? Young Master Chu, call your friends out. Let's go out to drink and get to know each other. Let's forget this matter. What do you think?"

Chu Xiaoye smiled faintly and said, "What if I say no?"

Mo Ziqi's expression sank and he said, "Young Master Chu, are you really looking down on us with this attitude?"

Chu Xiaoye nodded and said, "Yes, I'm looking down on you. So what?"

Mo Ziqi was stunned and sneered. "What arrogance\! Do you think this Qin family can protect you?"

Yang Shaoqing said with a disdainful expression, "A mere family of merchants. My father can make him kneel and beg for mercy with a word\! Young Master Chu has just arrived in Suhang, so you probably don't know our names, right?"

Chu Xiaoye watched as they spoke one after another. When they stopped talking, he said, "Are you done? If you're done, scram\! I have nothing to do with this Qin family. I don't think that the Qin family will protect me, nor will I give the Qin family any face to fawn on you. Do you see Young Master Qin? If you want to lie on the ground like him, come over. My hands are itchy and I want to rub them."

With that, he rolled up his sleeves and walked over.

The expressions of the few young men changed when they saw this. They hurriedly retreated and pointed at him. "Kid\! Just you wait\! You'll regret it\! Let's see how long you can be arrogant for\!"

After saying those fierce words, they immediately fled.

They were all cultured people and did not know how to fight.

Seeing that they had all fled, Qin Wen struggled to get up from the ground and looked hatefully at the youth in front of him. "You crazy son\! If you provoke them, let's see how you leave alive\!"

Then, he looked at Qin Mo and sneered. "The guest you brought back will kill our Qin family\! You'll regret it\!"

With that said, he staggered away.

Qin Mo rubbed her tears and looked at Chu Xiaoye. "You should leave quickly. Our Qin family can't afford to provoke those people."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and immediately said to the house, "Lanisi, come out. Let's go now\!"

If not for the fear that those people would take revenge on the Qin family, he would have long gone up and crippled those fellows.

The door opened and Catherine was the first to rush out.

Catherine walked out quickly with Fei'er and the others.

Qin Mo wiped her tears and said, "I'll prepare a carriage for you."

Soon, a carriage stopped outside Qin Manor.

Chu Xiaoye immediately brought Catherine and the girls onto the carriage.

Qin Mo also sat up and said to the middle-aged man driving the carriage, "Uncle Wang, go to the pier. My father is there."

The middle-aged man acknowledged and immediately swung his whip, leaving with the carriage.

When Qin Mo crawled into the carriage, Chu Xiaoye frowned and said, "If we leave, will those people find trouble with your Qin family?"

Qin Mo smiled bitterly and said, "Perhaps. But it's okay. My father knows many people and is a famous philanthropist in Suhang. Furthermore, you didn't do anything to those young masters. They won't mess around."

Chu Xiaoye sighed and said, "I saw their hypocritical and shameless appearance just now. I really wanted to go up and punch each of them, but I was afraid that I would implicate you. Fortunately, I endured it and did not attack."

Qin Mo said dejectedly, "Unfortunately, my brother… Sigh, he must hate me to death."

Chu Xiaoye could not comfort her and could only stay silent.

Soon, the horse carriage brought them to the harbor.

The harbor was very lively. Many workers were loading and unloading goods. Many big and small boats were docked on the shore, and everyone was busy in full swing.

Qin Mo brought them down the carriage and walked to the harbor. He started to search.

"Uncle Qin is there\!"

Chu Xiaoye saw Qin Zhitan at a glance and hurriedly walked over.

At this moment, Qin Zhitan was talking to a dark-skinned old man with a smile on his face. He looked like he was having a good talk.

When Chu Xiaoye brought Lanisi and the others in front of them, Qin Zhitan realized that and he was first shocked, then his expression changed. "Nephew Chu, are you leaving now? What's going on? Is something wrong?"

Qin Mo hurriedly went forward and explained what had happened previously angrily. "Father, Brother has changed. In order to please those people, he actually betrayed Young Master Chu and the others."

Qin Zhitan's face was dark and the corner of his eyes twitched a few times. He immediately looked at Chu Xiaoye and said, "Nephew Chu, let's not delay. Let's go on the ship now."

Then, he said to the dark-skinned old man beside him, "Uncle Wu, double the price just now and set off immediately. Can you do that?"

The old man frowned and said, "Is it so urgent? My goods…"

Qin Zhitan immediately said, "Don't worry about those goods. I'll let Brother Yang bring them over when we set off tomorrow. At that time, when we return, my two boats will also help you bring some goods. Uncle Wu, this is the only time I'm begging you to do something. Brother Yang and the others are not here yet and can only set off tomorrow. Now, only your crew is here and can set off immediately. Please help me this time."

The old man sighed and said, "Alright, I'll help you this time. However, Zhitan , I just heard from your Mo'er that the person you offended this time has a big background. You have to be careful."

Qin Zhitan sneered and said, "Although those people are powerful, my Qin family is not a persimmon to be kneaded casually. Furthermore, the fault is theirs. We have never attacked. What can they do to my Qin family?"

The old man smiled and looked at Chu Xiaoye and the others. "Everyone, follow me onto the ship. We'll set off immediately."

Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "Thank you."

He looked at Qin Zhitan and said, "Uncle Qin, sorry to trouble you."

Qin Zhitan shook his head and smiled bitterly. "We did not serve you well. We originally wanted to bring you to Suhang to play for a while, but this happened. Sigh, everyone, promise me."

Chu Xiaoye cupped his hands and followed behind the old man with Lanisi and the others, walking towards the big ship by the sea.

Qin Mo suddenly said from behind, "Young Master Chu, if you were born in Southern Tang, you would definitely be better than my brother and be the top scorer."

Chu Xiaoye stopped and turned to look at her. He smiled and said, "Miss Mo'er, if you were in my world, you would also be a famous talented girl. The young talents who are looking for marriage can probably line up from Qin Manor to this sea."

Qin Mo's face suddenly turned red and she looked at him in a daze.

Unfortunately, Chu Xiaoye had already turned around and left quickly.

After Chu Xiaoye and the others followed the old man onto the big ship, under the old man's orders, the crew started to get busy and prepare to set off.

At this moment, the workers transporting the goods on the pier suddenly ran around in panic.

A team of soldiers rushed over.

What followed were a few young men riding tall horses and a few carriages.

"Father\! Father\! Save me…"

Little Guai's cries suddenly came from one of the carriages.

Qin Zhitan's wife also cried out from the carriage, "Master, they caught me and Little Guai and even broke Yu'er's legs. Wu…"

Qin Zhitan's expression changed.

The team of soldiers stopped at the pier and split into two rows, standing neatly on both sides.

Yang Shaoqing rode his horse and walked over with the young men with a cold and pleased expression. He said loudly, "Minister Qin, where are your guests? Don't tell me that they have already left\! If they've left, your wife and daughter will be in trouble."

"Bring that little girl over\!"

He turned around and shouted coldly.

Soon, two men in constables grabbed Little Guai's hair and dragged her down from the carriage to Yang Shaoqing's horse.

Little Guai's hair was messy and she cried.

Yang Shaoqing grinned hideously. He no longer had the image of a scholar. He pointed the whip in his hand at the little girl in front of the horse and said, "Minister Qin, this is your younger daughter, right? I'll give you half an hour to let your few guests appear in front of me\! Otherwise, I'll let someone strip you of your little girl's clothes and let all the men at this pier see them before throwing them into the sea\!"

Qin Zhitan's eyes almost split open.

Yang Shaoqing pointed the whip in his hand at Qin Mo, who was beside him, and grinned hideously. "I almost forgot. What about you, the eldest daughter of the Qin family? You're just 14 this year, right? You're at the age of being beautiful. After peeling off your sister's clothes, I'll peel off your clothes. I believe the men on the pier love to see your tender skin and flesh at your age. Hahahaha…"

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, an arrow suddenly shot over from the big ship. With a whoosh, it actually pierced through his mouth and instantly pierced through his entire neck\!

The laughter in Yang Shaoqing's mouth stopped\!

He widened his eyes and was stunned for a moment. Then, he raised his head and fell from the horse with a bang.

Everyone was shocked\!

Qin Zhitan's body trembled and he looked back.

On the deck, a tall elf girl was facing the sea breeze. Her silver hair fluttered as she held an icy blue jade bow and looked over coldly.

As for the young man who had already boarded the ship, he suddenly held an unsheathed sword and jumped onto the pier with a few girls, running over\!

The anger and fear in Qin Zhitan's heart instantly turned into blood and courage. He pulled out the dagger at his waist with a whoosh and roared, "Men of the Qin family, let's fight them to the death\!"

Two Qin family ships were docked at the harbor. Although the crew had yet to arrive, there were at least a hundred people. Furthermore, most of them were members of the Qin family. There were the older generation and the younger generation. When they saw Yang Shaoqing's arrogant and cruel actions just now, they were already furious. At this moment, seeing that the matter had reached this point and that the arrow was on the bow, they had no choice but to attack. They roared angrily, casually picked up their fellows, and followed Qin Zhitan up\!

Yang Shaoqing was killed and Qin Zhitan took out his dagger to attack. No egg was intact when the nest was overturned. No one from the Qin family could survive.

Therefore, they risked it all\!

At most, he would be exiled and never return\!

Some Qin family children immediately mixed in the crowd when they received the order and left the pier. They ran home to inform the others in the Qin family.

The two teams of soldiers only had dozens of people. When they saw the riot, they were shocked. They hurriedly pulled out their waist blades and protected the few young men on their horses. They said quickly, "Go\! Go quickly\! Go and get people\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's arrows shot over again, targeting the people on the horses\!

Chu Xiaoye had personally instructed her.

He could not kill the others, but he had to kill the few young men who had ill intentions and had done many evil deeds\!

He had the reputation of a cultured person and looked elegant and polite, but he actually did those despicable, shameless, and extremely dirty things in secret. This person deserved to die\!
