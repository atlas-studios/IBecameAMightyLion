Chapter 409: Untitled

"Roar —"

Belia roared to show her might\!

At the same time, she lowered her body, narrowed her eyes, and revealed her sharp claws, preparing to pounce.

She wanted to slap this lioness cub until it cried\!

However, Catherine ignored her and turned around. She returned to the original grass and lay down, never looking at her again.

Belia was stunned for a moment before she bared her fangs and roared again, challenging her.

Catherine closed her eyes.

This attitude of disregard made Belia, who had been slapped, embarrassed and angry\!

Was this despicable lioness looking down on her, Belia?

Just as she was furious and was about to pounce on her to demand an explanation, Chu Xiaoye walked in front of her, raised his claws, and rubbed her head gently.

Belia immediately put away her fangs and her fierce expression instantly melted, turning into a charming and cute appearance.

She closed her eyes and gently arched her head, looking pleased and flattered.

"Bang\!"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye slapped her face and slapped her to the ground, telling her to scram.

When Mei Mei, who was not far away, saw this scene, her body immediately trembled and she grinned.

His brother was still the same. He was rough and heartless, liked violence, and never had mercy on women. Sigh.

Belia lay on the ground with tears in her eyes again and looked at him aggrieved.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at her and no longer had the mood to watch Little Curly Tail and Molly fight. He turned around and jumped up the tree to climb to the highest point.

Belia slowly got up from the ground, her eyes filled with tears. Her eyes were red as she gritted her teeth, looking extremely resentful.

It seemed that she was thinking too much. That bastard did not even look at her\!

Alright\! In that case, it was unnecessary for her to stay here. She might as well leave this place and go out to find more outstanding males\!

She, Belia, was born elegant, beautiful, and sexy. She did not believe that she could not find a better partner than this bastard\!

From today onwards, she would cut ties with him and never look at him again\!

Even if that bastard knelt on the ground and begged her to turn around, it would be useless\!

"Chi—"

Right at this moment, urine suddenly flowed down the tree trunk. At the same time, a unique smell of males quickly filled the air.

Belia, who was about to leave, suddenly rushed under the tree with a whoosh. She looked up and widened her eyes, her eyes shining with excitement.

This was the smell of male hormones. That fellow could not help but feel aroused by her and could not help but react. Hahahaha\!

"Roar —"

Belia turned around and called out to Catherine, who was lying in the grass. Her face was filled with pride, and like a victorious general, she walked around in front of her valiantly.

Catherine closed her eyes and did not look at her.

Chu Xiaoye finished peeing at the top of the tree and was about to go down when he suddenly saw a black cloud appear in the distant night sky.

The black cloud moved very quickly, and many scarlet lights lit up inside, like pairs of blood-red eyes.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. His eyes flickered with a golden light. He looked carefully and was shocked.

The huge black cloud was actually formed by giant bats\!

The eyes of the bats were scarlet and they flew extremely quickly. In the blink of an eye, they came close from the distant sky. Their outlines became even clearer and ferocious.

At the same time, the dense numbers almost covered half the sky\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately climbed down from the top of the tree and growled at the pride on the ground, telling everyone to hold their breaths and lie on the ground without making a sound.

When they heard the alarm, the members of the pride did not hesitate at all. They immediately crawled in the grass and did not move. They looked up, wanting to see what kind of enemy it was.

Chu Xiaoye hid on a dense branch and probed the group of giant bats that were approaching from afar through the gaps in the leaves.

The giant bats spread their wings and were two meters long. Not only were their claws sharp, the sharp teeth that popped out of their mouths were also sharp like blades and exceptionally sharp\!

Chu Xiaoye was secretly shocked. He looked down at the ground, wanting to see if everyone was hiding. However, he suddenly realized that the lioness wrapped in mud had slipped back into the mud pit at the side and even buried her head.

This female lion had clearly realized the danger, or she had already seen how powerful this group of giant bats was.

"Squeak\! Squeak\!"

The noisy cries of the giant bats quickly approached.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was nervously peeping, the group of giant bats suddenly landed hundreds of meters in front of him. Like a black tornado, they fell from the sky with a whoosh and fought to be the first to form a black torrent that hung in the night sky\!

"Roar—"

A series of roars suddenly came from the forest not far away\!

Those roars were filled with fear and anger, as if they were fighting the bats.

In a moment, a group of tall jaguars appeared in Chu Xiaoye's vision and were running over in panic.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked\!

These jaguars had clearly been hiding nearby for a long time and did not make any sounds. They might have come specifically to attack them.

The giant bats attacked the jaguars ferociously\!

The jaguars were strong and extremely fast. With a swipe of their claws, they could tear apart a few giant bats. However, there were too many giant bats\!

In the blink of an eye, the few American leopards that fell behind were torn to pieces by the giant bat and devoured. Not even bones were left.

The remaining three jaguars were extremely shocked. They ran over with all their might, as if they were deliberately leading the disaster to the pride here.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly jumped down from the tree and roared. He called for the pride and prepared to escape.

There were a lot of giant bats and their claws were sharp. No matter how good they were at fighting, they could only be torn apart.

However, just as the members of the pride jumped up from the grass, the three American leopards had already rushed over with the black mass of giant bats. They did not give them any chance to escape\!

"Roar —"

When the three jaguars saw the pride, they immediately roared, as if they were gloating and had actually forgotten their fear.

They knew that they could not outrun these giant bats and would definitely die. Fortunately, they could pull so many to die with them\!

The members of the pride gathered beside Chu Xiaoye and looked at the black mass of giant bats pouncing over with terrified gazes. For a moment, they were at a loss and did not know how to resist.

Even Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur's eyes revealed despair.

A head quietly popped out from the mud pit not far away.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, an earth-shattering roar suddenly erupted from Chu Xiaoye's throat\!

Like an explosion, he descended into the world with a bang\!
