Chapter 134: The Killing of Kings

Under the morning sun.

That figure was as fast as lightning\!

The hyena leader did not have the time to react before it was pounced to the ground and bit its throat\!

At this moment, the other hyenas around her reacted.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

They immediately ran in panic.

However, they did not dare to go forward to save her, nor were they willing to leave. They could only run in panic not far away and shout, as if they were trying to scare him while feeling weak inside, or urging their companions to go forward.

The hyena leader opened her mouth and widened her eyes. Her eyes were filled with confusion, as if she would die before she could figure out what was happening\!

Under the big tree not far away.

The female cheetah raised her head and looked at this scene in fear.

She never would have thought that this cub, who had already reached a dead end and was about to be surrounded to death by the hyenas, would suddenly erupt with such terrifying strength\!

The two little cheetahs were still lying in her arms, sleeping soundly.

Chu Xiaoye loosened his teeth and let go of the hyena leader who had stopped breathing in his mouth. He looked up at another hyena.

A dog was not enough for him to eat\!

"Whooshâ€”"

He rushed over again, jumped up, and pounced at the female hyena that was roaring happily\!

Seeing that he was too fast, the female hyena knew that it could not escape. It could only open its mouth and prepare to bite.

With its bite strength, as long as it bit this cub, its skin and flesh would definitely be lacerated and it could not break free\!

However, Chu Xiaoye did not give it any chance. He suddenly slapped it on its open mouth\!

"Bang\!"

The female hyena immediately tilted its head and did not resist at all. It fell to the ground, its fangs broken and its mouth full of blood\!

It lay on the ground, feeling dizzy and its vision turned black. For a moment, it could not get up.

Chu Xiaoye walked forward and slapped it again, hitting its neck hard. With a crack, its neck was broken\!

The female hyena immediately let out a scream and lay on the ground, twitching all over and unable to stand up.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop. He raised his head and looked at another hyena not far away.

At this moment, the hyenas finally knew how terrifying he was. Even if they could not bear to let go of the little elephant, they had no choice but to flee in panic\!

However, Chu Xiaoye was not going to let them go\!

He rushed up again\!

A moment later, three more hyenas fell to the ground, their eyes wide with fear.

The other hyenas were even more shocked and ran for their lives\!

Chu Xiaoye chased out of the forest and looked at the rising sun. He stopped in his tracks.

He raised his head and roared at the hyenas that were fleeing towards the grassland, warning them to scram as far as possible\!

The hyenas had long been scared out of their wits. They only regretted that their parents did not give them two more legs. They even used the strength to drink milk and ran for their lives, not daring to return.

They believed that this forest would scar them for life.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and brought the corpses of the other three hyenas to the side of the hyena leader's corpse.

He was very hungry and prepared to eat them all\!

As for the hyena whose neck he had broken, it was still lying there crying out miserably. With its tenacious life force, it could last for at least two more days before it completely stopped breathing.

Where there were hyenas, other carnivores generally did not dare to approach unless they were lions.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated again and again, but in the end, he could not resist the hunger in his heart. He tore open the fur of a female hyena and started to eat.

As for the taste, when one was hungry, one would not care about the smell. It was enough as long as they could fill their stomachs.

However, he only ate half of it and could not eat anymore.

The remaining meat was really difficult to swallow.

Even the jerky he preserved was more delicious than the hyena's meat.

He raised his head, licked the blood on his mouth, and looked at the distant grassland.

Dawn finally arrived.

He had to hurry again.

Those humans would appear again at any time.

From their previous chase, they would not let the matter rest.

He could only be at ease when he left the grassland where cars could run quickly.

He needed to find a place with mountains, water, food, and it was difficult for humans to find and grow quietly.

He wanted to follow the dry river to the west and find the source of the river and the traces of the mountain.

Of course, there were mountains on the grassland, but they would be very far away.

He had plenty of time.

If he could really find a safe place to eat and drink, he would first occupy the land as king, subdue the pride, and expand his faction. Then, he would return to bring Little Curly Tail and the others.

The territory where the cold father's pride lived was not only small but also lacking in food. It was the most difficult place to survive the dry season.

Therefore, in order to reproduce and develop the pride, he had to find a better territory for them.

He would be responsible for charging into battle, fighting on the battlefield, and looking for his home again\!

Just as he was looking at the distant grassland and thinking about something with surging emotions, his butt was suddenly touched by someone.

He turned his head and saw that the little stupid elephant was standing behind him again, teasing his butt with its nose, like a pervert.

He really wanted to kick it and teach it a lesson, but he was afraid that he would waste his strength. Not only was the other party not in pain, but it would also even show a very comfortable expression.

This was a perverted elephant that gave him a headache\!

Under a big tree not far away.

The female cheetah was drooling as she looked covetously at the hyena corpses beside him.

When she realized that this terrifying cub was looking at her, she hurriedly lowered her head, her eyes filled with fear and panic.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and slapped the little elephant's head. Then, he passed through the forest and continued forward.

The little elephant immediately swayed its nose and followed behind him.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and roared at it, indicating that he did not welcome it to follow him.

The little elephant let out an aggrieved and stubborn cry, indicating that it wanted to follow.

Chu Xiaoye looked at its strong body and thought to himself, "Alright, let's follow. When I'm hungry, I'll eat your meat. When I'm thirsty, I'll drink your blood. Nice\!"

The little elephant raised its nose, as if it was saying, "Welcome\!"

This idiot\!

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart and quickened his steps.

For safety, he walked to the river again and walked along the river.

Not long after, the cry of vultures suddenly came from ahead.

In the sky, vultures constantly circled around and then flew down.

Soon, he saw a corpse lying on the riverbed in front of him. Many vultures were pecking at the flesh on it.

It was the corpse of a lion.

He looked thin and there was not much flesh on his tall skeleton.

From the sparse mane on his neck, he was a very young lion, about two years old.

For some reason, Chu Xiaoye's heart suddenly trembled.

He quickened his steps and walked over.
