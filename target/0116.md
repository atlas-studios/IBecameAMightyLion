Chapter 116: The Thoughts of the Cold Father

Catherine did not sleep for the entire night.

The warthog on the tree also shivered for the night.

After dawn.

Little Curly Tail brought it down from the Baobab tree and made it continue to work.

The cold father left early in the morning to patrol the territory and pee at the borders of the territory, leaving scent marks.

This was his job and responsibility.

In this weather, scents dispersed very quickly.

Therefore, he had no choice but to walk around the border every few days and be busy.

Although it was tiring, it was better than having a wandering lion barge in and fight to the death.

The female lions hid in the shade and did not dare to move.

The weather was unbearable.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail, they continued to collect the materials to make traps in the bushes at the back.

Mei Mei supervised the warthog's work. She was very bored and started to dig the soil with her claws.

The warthog that was working hard at digging snorted unconsciously when it saw this scene, as if it was mocking her.

Mei Mei immediately flew into a rage out of humiliation. She mimicked her brother's action of slapping Little Curly Tail and slapped the warthog on the head\!

The warthog was frightened and hurriedly continued to bury its head in work, not daring to make another sound.

Many animals could not survive this weather.

But for warthogs, it was a piece of cake.

They were like camels, and their bodies seemed to be able to store water. Even if they did not drink water for a few months, there would be no problem.

This warthog worked especially hard. In just half a day, it dug a lot deeper into the pit.

To reward it, Chu Xiaoye brought it another big piece of plant root in the evening.

When the sky turned dark, the cold father returned exhausted.

At this moment, the warthog had yet to be brought to the Baobab tree by Little Curly Tail and was lying in the grass to rest.

The cold father suddenly roared and rushed over\!

He was very thirsty and needed to drink some blood to replenish his energy. He could also eat his fill.

The warthog snorted and jumped up from the grass in fright, but it did not dare to escape.

Its hind legs were injured and it could not escape.

Right at this moment, Little Curly Tail, who was lying at the side, suddenly got up and rushed over to stop the cold father, looking at him coldly.

This was the first time he had treated his father with such a tough and rude attitude\!

The cold father stopped in front of him, bared his fangs, and glared at him. He looked extremely angry\!

His body was larger than Little Curly Tail's. His lush mane made his head and face look especially dignified and terrifying\!

His low growl emitted the invincible aura of a lion king, causing all animals to tremble in fear\!

However, Little Curly Tail was still blocking him and looking at him without giving in.

He was his brother's claw\!

No one could take away his brother's things without his permission\!

He had once feared and respected this powerful father, but now, he was no longer afraid\!

He only had eyes for his brother, but not this lion king\!

In his heart, his brother was the lion most qualified to be king in this pride\!

If not for his brother, all the members of the pride would have died\!

As for his father, he had no right to flaunt his might here, dominate and bully them\!

He was not worthy\!

"Roarâ€”"

The cold father roared and bared his fangs, as if he was facing an enemy\!

Rebellion\! Rebellion\!

This unfilial son was courting death\!

Aisha hurriedly stood up and came to Little Curly Tail's side, urging him to move away.

Her eyes were filled with worry.

If he angered the king, he would probably chase both of them out in advance like how he chased Lars away.

Little Curly Tail ignored Aisha and continued to stand there stubbornly without fear\!

He was not afraid\!

At most, he would run away from home with his brother\!

With his intelligence, oh no, his strength, and his brother's intelligence, the brothers could rely on themselves to snatch a better territory\!

The cold father bared his fangs and roared angrily. He prepared to pounce on Little Curly Tail and teach this kid who dared to disobey his father a lesson\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine back from the bushes at the back.

He had been behind teaching Catherine to peel the branches and green skin with her claws and prepare to make ropes. When he heard the noise, he immediately rushed back.

At this moment, seeing that the father and son were ready to fight, Chu Xiaoye immediately walked over.

The cold father looked at him and then at Catherine behind him with a dark gaze.

He turned his head and started to roar continuously at the distant grassland.

This was declaring his sovereignty to the wandering lions around the territory.

Every lion king would use this low growl to warn their enemies at night.

However, the cold father's warning seemed to be not only aimed at the wandering lion.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him and ignored him. He gestured for Little Curly Tail to bring the warthog up the tree.

This warthog was extremely useful to him and might completely eliminate the threat of the pride. If he ate it because of his momentary greed, the gains would not make up for the losses.

When Little Curly Tail brought the warthog up the Baobab tree, Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and gestured for Catherine to go up the tree to get water.

There was not much food, but there was enough water.

Although this king was a little overbearing and selfish, he had indeed worked hard. The previous mission of patrolling the territory was not only tiring, but also dangerous. There was a possibility of encountering a wandering lion at any time.

Seeing him open his mouth and pant, his mouth was clearly dry and he was extremely thirsty.

It was only right to let him drink some water.

Catherine looked up at Little Curly Tail on the tree and seemed to be hesitating.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei still did not know where the water source was. Was he sure that he wanted Little Curly Tail to know?

She looked into his eyes again.

Chu Xiaoye called for Mei Mei, who was not far away, to come over and follow Catherine up the tree.

It was time to let them know where the water source was hidden.

When he saw the tiger with abnormal strength, he had a bad feeling.

Therefore, he had to explain some things to them.

After getting his confirmation, Catherine stopped hesitating and immediately climbed up the Baobab tree with Mei Mei. She started to open the fur on the branch.

When she used her claws to dig out the damp wood dregs in the tree hole and revealed a pool of water, Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail were shocked.

It turned out that the water was hidden here\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail looked down at his brother and was finally utterly convinced that his brother was indeed smarter than him\!

After taking the water with the water bag, Catherine went down the tree and did not seal the tree hole.

Since he wanted them to know, he would let them study it.

Chu Xiaoye took the water bag from her mouth and walked in front of the cold father, placing it in front of him.

The cold father was stunned for a moment. He looked at him and then at the water on the ground. His eyes flickered and he immediately lowered his head to drink.

Hmph\!

Was he starting to give in now?

It was too late\!

When you are a year old, you will be expelled\!

If he remembered correctly, these two brats would be one year old in half a month\!
