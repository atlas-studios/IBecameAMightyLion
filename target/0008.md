Chapter 8: Lion vs Python\!

Night fell.

A silver moon rose up the branches.

The lionesses had returned.

They seemed a little dejected as they only brought back a small warthog.

Aisha was limping and seemed to be injured.

The four female lions dragged the warthog into the bushes and placed it in front of Xi'er, preparing to enjoy it with her.

"Roar—"

At this moment, the lion suddenly jogged back from the darkness. Its mane fluttered in the wind majestically.

The four female lions' stomachs were rumbling with hunger. Just as they were about to quickly take a few bites of their prey, the male lion suddenly roared angrily and dashed over, slamming its claws at them\!

His actions were fierce and merciless\!

The female lions retreated in panic.

The lion bared its teeth and growled as if it was threatening and reprimanding them.

Then, he lay down beside the prey and enjoyed a fresh dinner in satisfaction.

The five female lions stood at the side, pacing back and forth. They were exhausted and hungry, but they could only drool.

Little Curly Tail ran to his mother's side and shouted.

Aisha looked at him lovingly. She had no choice but to lie on the ground and feed him with milk.

Her injured front leg was trembling slightly.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch and quietly watched this cold-blooded and selfish scene filled with motherly love.

He climbed down from the tree and walked over to the lion who was chowing down. He was about to bite a piece of meat for his mother.

However, before he could get close, his father suddenly raised his claw and slapped him on the head, causing him to fall to the ground. He let out an angry and low growl, his gaze cold and merciless\!

Chu Xiaoye was in pain.

And furious\!

The lionesses hunted hard and nurtured the lion's offspring, while the lion enjoyed the fruits of their labor. It had just eaten its fill in the morning, and at night, it was still snatching such a pitiful amount of food from the lionesses\!

Damn it\!

He knew that this was the rule of the pride of lions. There was no way to change it.

However, he could not tolerate it\!

"Pfft—"

He suddenly got up, stuck up his butt, and faced his father, the lion who was slowly chewing his food and let out a loud and melodious fart\!

Black smoke came out from his butt\!

Recently, he always felt that there were always these kinds of stinky farts in his body that he could release whenever he wanted to. It was very satisfying\!

An extremely strong stench instantly assaulted the lion's head and its gluttonous mouth\!

"Ouch\! Ugh—"

The lion jumped up on the spot\!

At the same time, he spat out the flesh that he had just eaten\!

After Chu Xiaoye finished farting, he ran away. He moved his limbs and ran very quickly. He dashed to the side of the big tree and jumped up, quickly climbing onto a branch\!

The lion chased after him furiously. He raised his head and stood under the tree, baring his fangs and glaring at him fiercely.

The five female lions immediately took this opportunity to snatch the food\!

Soon.

The small warthog was eaten clean by the hungry lionesses.

The lion was flustered and exasperated, but did not dare to do anything to the five female lions.

After all, these female lions were his source of food.

He could only raise his head and roar angrily at Chu Xiaoye for a while before leaving resentfully.

Little Curly Tail's admiration for his brother was like a torrential river that flowed endlessly. It was like the overflowing of the Yellow River that could not be stopped\!

He even dared to tease his father. He was so awesome\!

The female lions ate some food. Although they could not satiate their hunger, it was better than nothing. They all lay down and started feeding the cubs.

Aisha raised her head and looked at Chu Xiaoye on the tree. Her eyes were filled with love and gentleness as she softly called him down to eat.

Xi'er looked at Chu Xiaoye with a motherly gaze filled with love and gentleness as well.

When Chu Xiaoye saw that the lion had gone far away, he climbed down the tree and walked to Aisha's side. He laid down and helped his mother lick the wound on her leg.

At this moment, the night and the lions were quiet and peaceful.

After the female lions and the young cubs fell asleep, Chu Xiaoye climbed onto a big tree and lay down on a thick branch. He fell asleep while feeling very tired.

The tree gave him a greater sense of security than the ground.

But.

He had forgotten the importance of teamwork.

He even forgot that he was still young.

It was not a good idea for a young cub to sleep alone.

Just as he was sleeping soundly, a dark head popped out from the dense foliage above him.

The head was triangular, flat and huge. Under the cold moonlight, its eyes flickered with an icy cold light.

It was a python\!

Although it was not very big, it was nearly three meters long\!

It spat out its scarlet tongue, raised its head, and slid down. Its thick and long body quickly wrapped Chu Xiaoye's small body around the tree trunk.

Then, it slowly tightened\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly woke up\!

A stench assaulted him\!

At the same time, he felt intense pain all over his bones\!

He also found it increasingly difficult to breathe\!

He opened his eyes and was shocked to see a ferocious-looking python spitting its scarlet tongue at him\!

And his small body was already tightly wrapped around the branch by this python's thick and long body\!

"Roar\!"

He hurriedly opened his mouth and struggled to make a weak cry for help.

But.

The voice was too soft so the lionesses did not hear it.

The python's body tightened\!

That scarlet snake tongue seemed to be mocking and ridiculing him as it shook on his face without restraint\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked, anxious, and furious, but he felt powerless and could not resist at all.

His breathing became more and more difficult.

All the bones in his body were almost crushed.

He began to despair.

When he was a human, he was most afraid of snakes.

He did not expect to die in the stomach of a snake after becoming a lion.

How ironic.

He, a majestic lion, had yet to become a lion king, had yet to expand his territory, had yet to have a group of wives and concubines, and was about to die before he could conquer the world.

How humiliating\!

When pythons hunted animals, they would first strangle the animals with their bodies, then open their mouths and swallow them slowly.

Chu Xiaoye already found it extremely hard to breathe.

In this moment of despair, the strange heat in his abdomen started to become restless and quickly spread throughout his body.

The pain in his body suddenly lessened.

His limbs were full of strength\!

However, he was tightly bound by the python's thick and long body. With his small body, he could not break free no matter how much strength he had.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that although his neck was tightly strangled and he could no longer breathe, he was still conscious\!

His consciousness was exceptionally clear\!

His heart gradually stopped beating\!

It was as if he had cultivated the Turtle Breathing Technique. Even though he was not breathing or his heart was not beating, his mind was still clear\!

However, this was not a solution.

In this situation, he did not know how long he could last.

He could not wait forever.

Even if the lionesses woke up, they might not be able to save him.

Therefore, he could only rely on himself\!

He closed his eyes and slowly relaxed his body. He did not move, did not breathe, and did not have a heartbeat. He pretended that he had been strangled and fainted.

Indeed.

The python tightened its grip for a while before releasing its body. At the same time, it opened its bloody mouth and tried to swallow his head\!

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up, opened his mouth, and bit down hard on its jaw\!

A python did not have venomous fangs\!

Even if they had venomous fangs, he could only risk his life\!

"Chi\!"

Although his teeth were small, they were exceptionally sharp. They instantly pierced through the python's lower jaw\!

The python's huge mouth was no longer able to close. It was in so much pain that its head swayed and its body started to twist violently\!

That thick body wrapped around Chu Xiaoye once again\!

However, Chu Xiaoye bit its lower jaw fiercely. Those two rows of sharp teeth seemed to be embedded in it and did not move at all\!

If the python were to use brute force and fall from the tree with Chu Xiaoye, Chu Xiaoye would probably faint and become its meal again\!

However, in its anger and pain, it used its thick body to wrap Chu Xiaoye tightly around the branch again, wanting to strangle him to death\!

It never would have thought that its massive killing power, which even a mature lion would be afraid of, would not be able to crush this young cub's body, let alone kill it\!

The snake and the lion were in a deadlock on the tree, biting and strangling each other, neither willing to let go.

The night quietly passed.

When the sky in the east began to turn white and dawn arrived, the python's thick and long body suddenly loosened and it fell from the tree\!

Its jaw was still dripping with blood as Chu Xiaoye bit on it and did not let go\!

It fell into the grass and died with a grievance\!
