Chapter 267: Golden Flag

Before the reinforcements of the black pride arrived, Chu Xiaoye had already brought the team and continued forward.

The young lion brought the two young cubs and quietly followed at the back of the team.

The surroundings were dark and filled with blood. The massacre of the black lions had already covered every corner of the grassland.

They had nowhere to go and were at a dead end. They could only feel a little sense of security by following behind this team.

Fortunately.

No one in this team chased them away.

Under the blood-colored moonlight, the young lion at the front had the golden fur on its neck. It was especially dazzling and made them feel exceptionally at ease.

Not long after.

The roars of the black devils came from ahead again.

Chu Xiaoye let the mixed fur trio leave with the pride first. He brought Catherine, Tilly, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei to the battlefield that was being slaughtered.

The corpses of a few young cubs lay in the grass dripping with blood, looking at the night sky with their eyes wide open.

Chu Xiaoye seemed to see his companions who had died in the pride of the cold father when he was young.

This weak life had already withered before it bloomed, like those flower buds that trembled and fell in the storm.

A few female lions ran over in fear.

In front of them, the few-month-old cubs stared with bright and terrified eyes. They instinctively ran with all their might, but their faces were confused. They did not know what they had done wrong to be injured like this.

The roars of the black lions were like the ferocious smiles of a butcher. They bared their ferocious fangs and chased after these weak and innocent lives.

A young cub fell to the ground.

The female lion hurriedly stopped and wanted to wait for it to get up.

The black lion behind her suddenly pounced and bit her throat\!

She fell to the ground.

The head of the young cub on the ground was also bitten to pieces by another black lion.

The mother and son widened their eyes and looked at each other. They were so close, but they could not touch each other anymore.

The remaining female lions and young cubs were still running in fear.

The black lions were getting closer and closer.

"Whoosh\!"

A few figures suddenly flashed past the female lions and young cubs and rushed into the black pride.

Cold light flickered and blood splashed\!

Roars and miserable cries immediately sounded in the black pride.

The female lions and young cubs stopped and turned around, looking in shock at the group of black executioners who had been killed by blood.

The group of murderous black executioners were like sheep waiting to be slaughtered. Under the massacre of the few young figures, they could not resist at all.

After a moment, the roars quietened down.

The black mass of butchers actually lay on the ground and turned into slaughtered corpses, like their pride from before.

The few young lions looked at them and left quickly.

The female lions and young cubs were stunned for a moment before they immediately chased after him.

At least, they would not hurt them.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and the others and caught up to the team.

Behind the team, there was another group of orphans and widows.

The lions, who were already homeless, looked at each other and seemed to understand something. Then, they tacitly looked at the team in front of them and followed silently, not daring to take a step back.

Soon, they encountered another injured pride by the river.

Two lions were hiding at the foot of the hill by the river with a group of female lions and young cubs. They were terrified and helpless, not knowing where to escape to.

It seemed that those black nightmares could not be forgotten anywhere.

When they saw Chu Xiaoye's team and the pride following behind, they could not help but follow behind silently.

At first, they were still a distance away. When they realized that this team did not have any ill intentions towards them or chase them away, they quickened their steps and caught up to the team.

When they communicated briefly with the prides following behind, they immediately merged with them.

Not long after.

Two more wandering lions joined.

Under the sweeping of those black horrors, all the lions and wandering lions on the grassland fell into a miserable state of having nowhere to go.

When they saw this majestic team, they immediately joined without hesitation.

After all, no one here would hurt them. Furthermore, they looked very strong.

When the sky was about to brighten.

The sounds of lions fighting came from the grassland ahead.

This time, Chu Xiaoye brought all the members of this team over.

A group of black lions were attacking a pride.

There was only one lion left in the pride, three female lions, and two young cubs. They were resisting in despair.

When Chu Xiaoye brought this super pride close, the two sides that were fighting froze in place and did not move. They looked at the huge team that suddenly appeared in shock.

The black lions suddenly started to tremble.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at his brother, Lars, behind him with an encouraging gaze.

Lars was stunned for a moment before he immediately rushed out.

"Roarâ€”"

He bared his fangs and roared angrily, pouncing on the black lions.

Although he was thin, weak, and not as strong as his brothers and sisters, he was also a member of the pride of the cold father and was a member of this team\!

He was a lion\! A true lion\!

He was not weak\!

When he roared angrily and pounced at the black lions without hesitation, Little Curly Tail suddenly roared angrily and prepared to charge\!

However, he saw his brother standing in place without any signs of wanting to go over.

"Roarâ€”"

Just as he was feeling puzzled, the pride at the back of the team suddenly roared angrily in unison. The pride seemed to have accumulated strength for a long time and suddenly erupted. With endless hatred and anger, they rushed out majestically from behind like a tide and followed behind Lars, charging bravely at the black lions\!

Even the young cubs that were only six to seven months old followed behind and roared angrily\!

Lars immediately seemed to be assisted by a god. He jumped up with a roar and pounced at a black lion, pushing it to the ground\!

The two lions that had been attacked previously immediately pounced forward and bit the black lion's neck and abdomen\!

When the other black lions saw this scene, they did not dare to stay any longer. They immediately turned around and fled in panic\!

Lars brought the pride that had lost their homes and roared as they chased after him. They became braver and stronger as they chased. They shared a common enemy and had a magnificent aura\!

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and stood in place, looking at them silently.

Little Curly Tail widened his eyes and watched this scene with his blood surging. He could not help but look at his brother again. The admiration in his heart was like a torrential river that flowed endlessly. It was like the overflowing of the Yellow River that could not be stopped\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt his butt turn cold. He suddenly raised his hind legs and kicked Mei Mei to the ground with a bang.

Mei Mei got up from the ground excitedly and looked at Little Curly Tail proudly, as if she was showing off.

"Look, I licked my brother again\!"

Little Curly Tail's eyes widened in anger.

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye's roar spread out in the dark grassland.

Lars returned with the pride.

The pride that had been lifeless, dejected, and in despair previously suddenly seemed to be full of life, hope, and confidence.

At this moment, they seemed to have finally realized that those terrifying enemies were actually not terrifying. As long as they were united, the other party would turn from a butcher to a lamb, turning from a massacre to a massacre\!

Those enemies were not invincible\!

As long as they had enough numbers and were united, they could take revenge and reclaim their home\!

At this moment, their almost desperate hearts suddenly reignited and burned with hope for tomorrow.

Lars returned to the team and looked at his father, then at the other members of the pride of the cold father. Finally, he looked at the figure at the front and a warm current suddenly surged in his heart.

For the first time, he felt the meaning of existence, the pride of a lion, and also understood for the first time why the one walking in front would become the true leader of the pride and team.

He would never be able to compare to her.

However, this time, he was not unwilling or jealous.

He was convinced and willing to work hard for this pride and team forever\!

It turned out that the excitement of living was not about what you had, but what you had done and what you were doing.

Even if you had nothing, at least you had experienced, been hot-blooded, excited, and willingly risked your life.

To a lion, this was enough.

After their hot blood subsided, the pride that had pulled themselves together continued to follow behind the team. They buried their hope and advanced forward.

On the grassland.

A red sun slowly rose.

The ground was golden.

The golden fur on the neck of the leading young lion shone like a golden flag. It led them from the night to the morning, from the cold to the sun.

More lions joined the team.

The pride that had lost their king, the cubs that had lost their female lions, the lion that had lost its pride, and the wandering lion and female lions all ran over from all corners of the grassland and joined in.

They, who had previously hidden in a dark corner and shivered in fear and despair, were standing in this team at this moment. All their fear retreated with the night and disappeared as the team grew stronger.

The majestic team walked on the sunny and lush grassland, becoming a strange and beautiful scenery on this grassland.

Even at night, it was still spectacular.

The black lions that had come with a murderous aura fled in panic before they could approach.

The pride started to counterattack. With hatred, anger, and strong confidence, they chased the black lions until they trembled in fear and fled in fear.

They ate the corpses of the black lions and thought back to the sorry state the butchers were in when they fled in panic. They became even braver and united.

Be it at night or during the day, the golden fur at the front had already become their invincible and fearless spiritual flag\!

They were united and no longer afraid\!
