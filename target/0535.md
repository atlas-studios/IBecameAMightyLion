Chapter 535: Long Live the Queen\!

At midnight.

The setting sun closed. It was quiet and dark, as if no one was standing guard.

However, Chu Xiaoye could clearly see the soldiers waiting above through the night.

Mocaton was not here. Clearly, he had gone back to heal.

Under the cover of the night, Carter approached quickly with the army.

When the soldiers above discovered the military situation and let out the alarm, Carter ordered the entire army to attack and surge towards the tall city like a tide.

At the same time, thunderous roars sounded in unison in the vast orc army. "Mocaton has betrayed the country and joined the enemy. He has already fled\!"

"Those who open the city gate and surrender can be pardoned\!"

"Whoever dares to resist will be implicated\!"

The Carter army shouted in unison as they attacked the city ferociously.

A loud and thunderous roar spread throughout the entire Sunset Pass in the quiet night.

The soldiers and citizens in the city were terrified.

Although the soldiers in the city were listening to the orders of the archery resistance, they were panic-stricken and had no fighting spirit.

"Boom\!"

The huge siege vehicle hit the thick city gate heavily\!

The roars of the Carter army sounded continuously. "Mocaton has committed treason and fled\! Anyone who opens the city gate can be pardoned\! Whoever dares to resist will be implicated\!"

In a simple mansion in the city, Mocaton, who was lying in bed unconscious, suddenly woke up.

He suddenly jumped up from the bed with his white hair hanging loosely. He picked up the sword at the head of the bed and wanted to rush out, but just as his feet landed, he felt dizzy and almost fell.

"Someone help\! Someone help\!"

He roared as he walked out shakily.

However, the mansion was suddenly in chaos. Under the lead of a few orc generals, a small group of soldiers suddenly attacked the mansion and started to kill the guards and servants inside.

They shouted, "Mocaton betrayed the country and joined the enemy. He colluded with the Bolton Kingdom and caught him\!"

At this moment, outside the city, the Carter army was shouting in unison.

The guards and servants of the Mocaton mansion resisted tenaciously at first. Gradually, they lost their fighting spirit and started to flee in panic.

Mocaton was blind in one eye. With his sword in hand, he walked out of the room and charged angrily at the soldiers who were slaughtering his family. However, just as he raised the sword in his hand, he staggered and fell to the ground.

Although the arrow in his eyes was pulled out, it injured his brain.

"Catch Mocaton\! Catch Mocaton\!"

The few orc generals that he had once whipped immediately roared and rushed over.

At the same time, the city gate outside suddenly opened from the inside.

"We surrender\! We surrender\!"

The soldier who opened the city gate threw down his weapon and knelt on the ground, shouting.

The Carter army roared and waved the weapons in their hands, rolling in like a flood\!

Before long, the entire Sunset Pass was occupied.

Mocaton still had many loyal subordinates resisting desperately, but they were like a mantis trying to stop a chariot and were quickly crushed clean.

When Carter brought the team to the general's residence, Mocaton was already escorted out by a few orc generals and stood at the door.

This old general with white hair did not even have the time to wear his shoes. His face was covered in blood and one of his eyes was blurry with flesh. He looked rather miserable, but he still straightened his chest and revealed the might of a general.

"Kneel when you see the princess\!"

A general behind him suddenly kicked the bend of his leg.

Mocaton staggered and knelt on the ground, but he immediately struggled to stand up. He looked at the orc girl on the horse and grinned coldly. "Princess, good move\!"

Carter raised her hand and stopped the general from continuing to insult this old general.

Before she attacked this city, she gritted her teeth in hatred and said that she wanted to tear this old man into pieces. Now that she had entered and saw this old general, the anger in her heart suddenly disappeared.

"Lord Mocaton, if you swear allegiance to me now, you can still live and guard Sunset Pass."

Carter looked at him calmly and said calmly.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but look at her again. This girl's thoughts were a little beyond his expectations.

When Mocaton heard this condition, he looked at her mockingly and said, "Your Highness, you called me a traitor to the country and the enemy. You're a royal princess. Do you dare to accept a traitor as your subordinate?"

Carter said coldly, "As long as you swear loyalty to me, all your crimes will naturally disappear immediately."

The ridicule on Mocaton's face grew stronger. His remaining eye was still bright as he looked at the princess and sneered. "It seems that I underestimated the princess in the past. The princess's methods today make me, an old general, feel ashamed of my inferiority. However, since I, Mocaton, have already pledged loyalty to others, I naturally won't betray them again. If the princess wants to kill or torture me, just do it. Why would I, Mocaton, be afraid?"

Carter did not care about what she was saying now. It conflicted with what she had said previously. She mocked, "Lord Mocaton, you should be loyal to the Lusni family, right? Your daughter is married to Zat of the Lusni family and your son, Moses, is also employed by the Lusni family. It is said that you fell in love with a girl from the Lusni family. You were originally loyal to my father, but you suddenly betrayed him. Even if you did not betray the country, you are a traitor. You don't deny it, right?"

Mocaton lowered his head slightly. After a moment, he raised his head and looked at her. "Indeed, the princess is right. To you and your royal family, I am indeed a traitor. However, I have risked my life for your royal family and guarded Sunset Pass for nearly forty years for the Kingdom of Kast. I have repelled the enemy's invasion countless times and faced death countless times. Even in one battle, when there were only a dozen or so people left beside me, I never thought of surrendering. I have been loyal to you for my entire life, but in the end? Your brother, your brother, the most respected prince in our kingdom, killed my sister and daughter. He raped them but accused them of offending her. Then, he threw them into prison and they were abused to death. Your father only reprimanded his beloved prince a little and did not even bear to slap him. Is this the reward for my loyalty to your family?"

Carter was silent for a moment before saying, "I heard about this too. Sorry, Lord Mocaton. I was at the border at that time, following my uncle to fight the Bolton Kingdom. If I were in the capital, I would definitely not sit idle."

Mocaton smiled miserably and said, "Even if you were in the Holy City, you can't stop him. I believe you know Furn's ruthlessness better than me. No one can stop him, even your father."

Carter narrowed her eyes and tightened her grip on the reins.

Mocaton bent down and said, "Alright, I didn't say so much to beg the princess to spare my life. I already committed an unforgivable crime by giving the order to kill the princess during the day. Please give the order, or I'll be lucky to get the princess to do it herself."

Carter looked at him and still persuaded, "Lord Mocaton, if you surrender…"

Mocaton shook his head and interrupted her. "Princess, please. The princess has never been an indecisive person, and she will never be soft-hearted. Just like when you were young, when I returned to the capital and you asked me for guidance on sword skills, Princess Meina's puppy suddenly ran over and called out to you a few times. You cut its head off with a sword. At that time, I remember that you were only nine. Princess Meina cried very sadly at that time, but she did not dare to provoke you. Even when your father asked, she did not dare to mention you. You were not inferior to Prince Furn in the palace at that time."

"Of course, now, you're still not inferior to him. In fact, you're even better."

Carter looked at him with trembling eyes.

She could not remember this anymore.

"Princess, please fulfill my wish."

Mocaton finally bent his knees, lowered his grayish-white hair, and knelt down trembling.

This time, he had to die. Otherwise, his family, his son and daughter in the capital would suffer as well.

The Lusni family would never let go of the family of anyone who betrayed them.

While Carter was still hesitating, Chu Xiaoye, who was beside her, whispered, "Go. Let's fulfill his honor and loyalty as a form of help. If he lives, it will definitely be more painful than death."

Carter looked at him a few times and stopped hesitating. She got down from the horse and pulled out her sword.

"Lord Mocaton, I will always remember your loyalty and apology. If I can return to the Holy City this time, I will pardon your family in the name of the king."

Carter raised her sword.

The old general kneeling on the ground suddenly raised his head and looked at her, muttering, "In the name of the king…"

"Whoosh\!"

Blood sprayed and heads fell to the ground.

Carter did not get on the horse. She suddenly walked in front of the two generals who had grabbed Mocaton and smiled. "You have done a great job. Tell me what reward you want."

The two generals were flattered and hurriedly knelt down.

However, before they could speak, the sword in Carter's hand that was still stained with the old general's blood cut their necks with a whoosh.

"Then I'll reward you with the honor of dying for the general."

Carter used her clothes to wipe the blood on his sword. Then, she returned to the horse and said to the trembling soldiers, "I said that if you pledge your loyalty to me, you can be pardoned."

Hence, all the soldiers who came out of the Mocaton mansion knelt on the ground uniformly.

Carter got on the horse, raised the sword in her hand, and said loudly, "From today onwards, I, Carter Danota, will no longer be your princess but your queen\!"

"Long live the Queen\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his arms and cried out.

The surrounding soldiers were stunned for a moment before they immediately raised the weapons in their hands and shouted in unison, "Long live the Queen\! Long live the Queen\!"

In the bloody Sunset Pass, the new queen slowly rose like the bright full moon\!
