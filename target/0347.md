Chapter 347: Untitled

The night retreated.

At dawn, the little girl was still sleeping soundly. There was a smile on her beautiful face.

However, he was soon woken up by Little Curly Tail's roar.

The bag of beef jerky was still placed beside her, as if it had never left.

The little girl picked it up and put it in her pocket. Then, she stood up and stretched. She looked at the fiery red morning sun rising on the distant grassland and raised her small pink fist, as if she was cheering for herself.

Chu Xiaoye climbed down from the tree, looked at her, and walked into the forest first.

With his previous experience, he did not climb straight up the mountain. Instead, he found the river and followed it up, preparing to jump over at the narrowest place.

However, when he brought the team to the river, he realized that the river was much wider than before and the water flow was much faster.

The terrain on both sides of the river was even more complicated.

The ground was covered in mud and the vegetation was lush. There was no place to jump.

With his jumping ability, he could jump over from the tree by the river, but what about the other members?

Especially Qiqi and Nunu. It was difficult for them to go over.

The cold father looked at the wide and rapid river and also frowned.

Maya stepped on the mud and walked to the river. She observed carefully before retreating helplessly. She looked at her two children worriedly.

The little girl stood beside Chu Xiaoye and thought while looking at the river. She suddenly patted his mane and pointed at the tree beside her to express her thoughts.

"We can make a small boat and row over."

Childish\!

Did they really think that small boats were so easy to make?

Even if he used his sharp claws to empty the trees and make a canoe, who could control the river water in such a hurry? At that time, if they all jumped into the water, they would probably feed the crocodiles.

However, looking at the tree, he suddenly had an idea.

"Bam\!"

He walked in front of the tree and slapped it. The tree immediately trembled and the leaves rustled.

When he gathered his strength and slapped down a second time, the tree immediately broke from the root and fell. With a whoosh, it smashed into the river.

Due to the fact that the roots were still connected, the tree that fell into the river was not washed away by the rapid river water.

He walked in front of the second tree and swung his claws again.

"Crack\!"

The second tree poured into the water again.

The little girl stood at the side with her eyes wide and mouth open, looking extremely shocked and in disbelief. She was clearly frightened by his strength.

Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Tilly, and Blue Eyes came over to help and slapped the big tree by the river into the water.

Under the obstruction of these trees, the rapid river water quickly slowed down.

Seeing that these lions could all break the tree with their claws, the little girl was completely shocked.

After the river water slowed down, Chu Xiaoye brought everyone to the back to break the big trees. Then, they transported the big trees over together. They stepped on the big trees that had fallen into the river previously and threw the newly broken trees into the river further in front. Their tails were stuck in the big trees at the back, making it difficult for the river water to wash away.

After repeatedly stacking the connections, this river was quickly filled with trees and extended to the other side.

The sounds of trees breaking could be heard in the forest. Soon, a bridge made of trees appeared on the wide river.

The river was not blocked completely. It could still flow from the bottom to the middle, but it was much slower.

Chu Xiaoye stepped on it, walked over, and walked back. He realized that although it was a little shaky and not too stable, it would not suddenly collapse.

After letting Blue Eyes and the rest throw down a few more big trees, he called for Maya to bring Qiqi and Nunu over first. He stood in the middle to guard, just in case.

Maya brought the two young cubs and carefully stepped on the tree trunk to start crossing the river.

When they walked to the middle, it was a little shaky. Qiqi and Nunu stopped in fright and did not dare to walk anymore.

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and looked at them sternly.

The two little fellows could only tremble and continue forward. They finally followed their mother and walked over.

Then, Xi'er, Aisha, and Callie walked over one after another.

Due to the fact that Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others were too big and could crush the tree, they had to cross last.

The warthog Pit and the honey badger, Little Mi, also walked over carefully.

Tilly stepped on the tree trunk and jumped over.

When it was Little Curly Tail's turn, this kid deliberately trembled on the tree trunk and walked in a slanted manner. His tail swayed back and forth and he made a dangerous move like he was about to fall into the water but did not. He played very excitedly, and in the end, he was slapped into the water by Chu Xiaoye.

However, after running around for a few days, his broken tail actually grew out again and was even more agile than before. He gently hooked it on the tree trunk and climbed up again, immediately running over.

Mei Mei and Molly walked over very easily.

When it was the little girl's turn, everyone looked at her uniformly, as if they wanted to see how this little animal that walked upright crossed the river.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the leather shoes under her feet. Just as he was about to remind her to take them off, he saw that after the little girl climbed up the tree trunk, she suddenly squatted down. Then, she placed her hands on the ground and actually started to crawl slowly.

"Chi chi chiâ€¦"

On the other side, Little Curly Tail grinned and spat, letting out an ear-piercing laugh.

This little fellow's actions were too comical\!

The little girl lowered her head and focused on moving forward. When she reached the middle of the river, the river beside her suddenly splashed with waves with a whoosh\!

Then, a huge python covered in patterns broke out of the water. It opened its bloody mouth and pounced at the little girl\!

The members of the pride on both sides were shocked.

The little girl froze in place, stunned.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly jumped up from beside her\!

Before the patterned python could pounce close, a golden light bloomed in midair, drawing a beautiful arc\!

Immediately, blood sprayed and the python's head was split into two.

"Whoosh\!"

The huge snake body fell heavily into the river, rolling and struggling in the water in pain, causing countless waves.

Chu Xiaoye also fell into the water, but he broke out of the water with a puff and landed on the tree trunk beside the little girl, causing the tree trunk to tremble.

The little girl swayed and almost fell, but she immediately leaned on him.

Chu Xiaoye stood near the river and protected her like a wall, but he did not look at her. Instead, he stuck his claws into the water and rinsed them.

Although there was no blood on them.

The little girl regained her balance, but she suddenly stuck her head into his neck. She rubbed it a few times and whispered thank you before continuing forward.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He turned around and looked at her small back, his gaze absent-minded.

Little Curly Tail, who was opposite him, widened his eyes. Not only did this little thing lean on his brother's body and grab his tail, it even rubbed its head against his domineering mane. How despicable\!

Even he was not qualified\!
