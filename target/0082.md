Chapter 82: King of Hyenas

Half a month later.

The drought grew worse.

However, the hot sun was merciless, still cruelly roasting the land that had long fallen into dryness.

Dust flew everywhere on the grassland.

A wolf that had gone out to hunt was lying on the ground, on the verge of death.

He was seriously dehydrated and could not stand up anymore.

His wife and children were waiting for him in the cave.

This "man" who was loyal to love and family and had dedicated his life to his family and family ultimately fell into this cruel season.

On the riverbed, the mud turned into armor and cracked into pieces.

The few old crocodiles had already been exposed to the sun and turned into dried corpses, forever buried in their territory.

Not far away, in a cave near the river bank, a small crocodile was hiding in the darkness motionless. It opened its eyes and watched everything silently.

By the river.

The few monkeys waiting for the river to fill had long become white bones.

The territory of the cold father's pride.

At a pile of rocks near the bushes, there was a lush patch of short trees with many caves hidden there.

At this moment, Callie was biting a wild rabbit with yellow fur as she carefully crawled into a bush full of thorns.

Her once bulging stomach had already shriveled.

When she walked to an abandoned cave with the wild rabbit in her mouth, three stupid cubs squeezed each other and ran out.

They could already walk and could eat some fresh meat.

One male and two female. This was the future of the pride.

Callie had to take good care of these furry little fellows.

However, food was extremely scarce during the dry season.

She had not found any prey for three days.

If they were not full, there would be no milk.

Fortunately, she caught a wild rabbit today.

But what about tomorrow?

The drought grew worse and the weather became hotter and hotter.

The sun was hot and the vegetation was withered. The herbivores that could be seen everywhere suddenly seemed to have disappeared and could not be found anymore.

Some hungry carnivores were wandering around.

For safety reasons, Callie decided to return to the pride with the three little fellows tonight.

At least there was a team protecting it and a lion guarding it.

She could hunt wholeheartedly.

"Roar\!"

The three little fellows started to fight over the wild rabbit.

Fighting was like playing. They did not have the intention of killing each other like some animals did when they were young.

Callie looked at them lovingly, then raised her head to look at the sun on the grassland.

The sun soon set.

The vast grassland was covered by the night.

A crescent moon hung on the horizon.

Callie left the cave with the three young cubs and walked towards the pride's camp.

The three young cubs followed behind, still playing around. They were full of energy and did not know fatigue.

Callie walked for a while, then waited, patient and gentle.

She did not enter the dense and dark bushes but walked outside the bushes.

Just as she was feeling happy and thinking about how to get the three children to greet their dignified father, a hyena suddenly walked out from the bushes beside her\!

It was a male hyena.

Although it was small, it looked ferocious and drooled from the corner of its mouth. Its green eyes flickered strangely in the night, looking extremely terrifying.

The strange thing was that it was different from other hyenas. No noise came from its mouth, and it did not run around. Instead, it stood there and looked at them coldly and quietly.

"Roar—"

Callie immediately bared her sharp fangs and roared at it fiercely. At the same time, she observed the surroundings vigilantly.

The three young cubs instinctively sensed danger and hurriedly stopped playing. They shivered and hid behind their mother.

The male hyena still stood quietly in place, looking at them coldly without moving.

Callie did not dare to expose her back and children to it. She suddenly roared angrily and pounced on it\!

She wanted to chase this damn hyena away completely\!

It was just a small male hyena and there were no other hyenas. She was not afraid of him\!

When she pounced forward with a roar, not only did the male hyena not dodge, it suddenly charged at her\!

Callie was stunned for a moment, but she still pounced ferociously\!

"Bang\!"

She did not bite the male hyena. Instead, she was suddenly knocked to the side by its violent impact.

By the time she reacted, the male hyena had already brushed past her and pounced on her children\!

"Roar—"

Callie was shocked and furious. She hurriedly turned around and chased after him\!

However, the male hyena was strangely fast. It instantly rushed in front of the three young cubs and bit the head of one\!

Then, he quickly ran towards the grassland\!

Callie roared angrily, and the strength of her motherly love suddenly erupted as she chased after him crazily\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The cries of other hyenas suddenly came from the bushes behind him.

The five male hyenas took the opportunity to jump out and charge towards the remaining two young cubs ferociously and excitedly.

Callie was shocked beyond compare. She hurriedly stopped in her tracks, turned around, and ran back\!

However, it was already too late\!

The two male hyenas bit her remaining two children and broke their necks.

As for the other three male hyenas, they bared their fangs and rushed towards her, their eyes filled with cold killing intent\!

"Roar—"

Callie's miserable and desperate cries rang out in the dark grassland\!

Carrying endless anger and hatred, she charged towards these despicable and cruel enemies without regard for her own safety and started biting crazily\!

The male hyena that first appeared walked back with the young cub in its mouth. It stopped near where she was fighting the three male hyenas and started to eat her children in front of her.

His name was Baley and he was the leader of the five male hyenas.

They were the stray hyenas’ alliance\!

Tonight, they were going to occupy the hyena pack that was stationed at the edge of the pride\!

And the hyena queen would become their dinner\!

From today onwards, the history of hyenas with females as their queens would be completely rewritten\!

He, Baley, was the king of this land's hyenas\!

Ever since he ate the corpse of the crocodile-like monster the other day, he realized that his strength and speed had become much stronger.

Even if he encountered a larger female hyena, he could bite it to death\!

The humiliation of being expelled from the tribe and being bullied by other hyenas would be washed away with blood tonight\!

Callie's miserable roar traveled very far in the quiet night.

The cold father and the other lionesses, who were resting in the camp, suddenly stood up and looked over.

They rushed over\!
