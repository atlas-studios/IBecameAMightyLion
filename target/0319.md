Chapter 319: Pursuing the Lion King

"Roar\!"

The night was no longer quiet. The battle had already started.

The black tide under the night sky could no longer move forward bravely. Instead, it flowed everywhere, running in front and behind, looking around, wandering around.

The entire formation was in chaos.

When Balo turned around and rushed towards Chu Xiaoye's pride, his loyal black lion army also rushed over with him.

However, the terrified female lions and young cubs instantly broke their formation.

As for the seven hundred plus lions led by One-eyed and Lars, they were already charging over with a murderous aura. They were like a torrential flood in the night, unstoppable\!

The moment they came into contact, the black lions that were panic-stricken and their morale collapsed at any moment. They were instantly drowned and had almost no combat strength.

Balo could not save them. He originally wanted to bring the pride to kill the small wave of enemies that had made him fail on the verge of success, but he realized that the other party was running around, still chasing away their lionesses and young cubs and charging at them.

They could not go over at all.

In his anger, Balo slashed down with his claws and tore apart a few female lions and young cubs. Seeing that the torrent of lions behind him was about to crush them, he did not dare to hesitate. He immediately roared and fled in panic with the remaining pride.

With his escape, the entire black lion army instantly disintegrated. Every member started to fight to escape, no longer having any fighting spirit.

When Chu Xiaoye saw this scene, he immediately put down the female lions and young cubs and joined up with One-eyed and the others, chasing after the fleeing black lion army.

Blood dyed the grass and fear spread throughout the black lion tribe\!

Black lions fell to the ground one after another. Before they could stand up, they were trampled to death.

More than half of the four hundred black lions had died in the blink of an eye.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and continued to chase mercilessly.

Be it lions, female lions, or young cubs, as long as they had black fur, they would not let go of any.

One kilometer.

Two kilometers.

Five kilometers.

Ten kilometers.

The crushing chase lasted for an entire night.

The green grass was filled with the corpses of black lions and their blood.

When the sun rose, there were only thirty or so black lions left among the once majestic pack.

The thirty-over black lions were all the most loyal and strongest warriors of the lion king, Balo. At this moment, they were still protecting him loyally and running in panic.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and still followed closely.

As for the pride behind him, other than Little Curly Tail and the others, only the blue-eyed, mixed fur, the Jerry brothers, and One-eyed were following behind. The other members could not run anymore and started to gradually fall behind.

Chu Xiaoye roared at the blue eye behind him and told him to return and lead the team to clean up the battlefield. He wanted to kill the remaining injured black lions and not leave a single one alive.

The blue eye immediately stopped and turned to return.

Although there were still more than thirty black lions, they were already at the end of the road. They were in despair and fear, with no fighting spirit. They only knew how to escape. Furthermore, they were falling behind one by one and being killed by them. They could not resist at all.

After chasing for a while, there were only ten lions left behind the black lion king, Balo.

The ten lions looked extremely strong and their stamina seemed to be still very good. Clearly, they had benefited from the mutation.

They were Balo's ten most loyal guards. Every one of them was once a famous lion king with many contributions\!

The black lion tribe was doomed. Those female lions and young cubs clearly could not escape.

In order to not let the entire black lion race be exterminated, they had to escape this place and preserve their bloodline to wait for the day of revenge\!

Their king was still their hope\!

As long as the king was still here, everything would return\!

Suddenly, Balo changed directions and ran towards the river at the foot of the hill.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. He immediately brought the team and chased after her.

"Whoosh\!"

Balo had just jumped down the hill when he suddenly dashed forward. With a jump, he actually crossed the river that was nearly twenty meters wide and landed steadily opposite.

Then, he suddenly swung his claws and slapped the huge rocks standing by the river.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The huge rocks that had fallen into the sand by the river actually flew up and quickly fell into the water. They piled up and popped out of the water\!

The ten black lions immediately sprinted and jumped. One after another, they landed on the rock that popped out of the water and suddenly jumped to the other side.

Chu Xiaoye, who had just caught up to the hill, was secretly shocked when he saw this scene.

The strength of this black lion king was actually so terrifying\!

If he had not used human schemes and crushed them with his army, the other party would have long killed them all\!

Such a powerful black lion naturally could not be left alive\!

Otherwise, the disaster today would happen again in the future\!

He had to eliminate the roots to prevent future trouble\!

"Whooshâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye jumped down the hill and did not stop. He followed behind the last black lion and jumped onto the stone in the middle of the river. Then, he jumped over.

Balo looked back and saw that there were only a few soldiers left in the pursuing army. Hesitation suddenly appeared in his eyes, as if he wanted to turn around and counterattack.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, golden light flashed. The last black lion that had just jumped ashore and was about to escape was cut in half and fell to the ground.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Catherine, Tilly, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, the mixed fur, and the Jerry brothers, who were following behind Chu Xiaoye, easily stepped on the stone and jumped over.

Balo's pupils constricted. He no longer hesitated and immediately fled in panic with the remaining nine lions.

The nine lions behind him were already exhausted after running for the night. Clearly, they did not have any combat strength. As for the other party's young lions, they still looked energetic and agile.

Furthermore, the prides at the back might catch up one after another.

Therefore, he had to escape this place as soon as possible. He had to bring the young lion king behind him and his subordinates into the desert.

Did he lose?

Not necessarily\!

As long as he killed this cunning young lion king and the powerful subordinates behind him, he might be able to snatch everything back\!

Balo narrowed his eyes and looked at the distant desert, his eyes flickering.

In the past, he had brought his tribe and migrated here.

As a newcomer, he did not know the true situation of this grassland. Therefore, in order to preserve his strength and the final fire of his tribe, he left a group of strong lions, female lions, and some young cubs in the oasis in the desert.

Although they were surrounded by the desert, the oasis was filled with water, vegetation, and abundant prey.

Those subordinates should be living carefreely now.

And there would be the grave of the young lion king and his subordinates behind him\!

He continued to flee in panic, looking like he had nowhere to run.
