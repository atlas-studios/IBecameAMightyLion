Chapter 180: The King of the Grassland\!

Could it be an earthquake?

Or was the volcano about to erupt?

Chu Xiaoye watched the majestic beast herd sprint away, his heart filled with doubts.

At this moment.

The disfigured blue-eyed lion king also ran over from the distant grassland with two lions. They passed his territory and followed the herd towards the distant snow mountain.

This strong lion king looked rushed and did not look at him.

Then, another huge lion king also ran over from afar with more than ten lions and left in a hurry.

Even the warthogs formed a large group and ran into the distance.

The birds in the sky were still black and continued endlessly, as if they were endless.

The grassland that was previously calm and peaceful suddenly seemed like the end of the world.

Chu Xiaoye was really frightened.

The Chino brothers also rushed over with panicked and terrified expressions.

They had never seen such a terrifying scene\!

It was as if all the animals on the grassland had been mobilized\!

"Roar —"

At this moment, a familiar roar suddenly sounded from the grassland not far away.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that it was the little leopard.

The leopard family of four also came out of the bushes and prepared to follow the herd.

The male leopard led the way.

Belita was at the back. She turned her head and roared at Chu Xiaoye, as if she was saying, "Go quickly, go quickly\!"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly ran over with the Chino brothers.

The male leopard looked at him and did not seem to be afraid.

Chu Xiaoye brought the Chino brothers and followed at the back, looking up at the beast pack in front of them.

Lion prides and hyena packs actually ran together and did not fight.

The carnivores and herbivores ran together and were actually okay.

When they passed by the wide river, they realized that the crocodiles in the river were all floating on the water and gathered together. They made way in the middle and used their huge bodies to temporarily block the river.

When groups of animals swam past the river, they ignored them and did not attack.

Even when some animals stepped on their heads in panic and swam past their eyes, not a single crocodile opened its mouth to bite them.

Chu Xiaoye was dumbfounded by the strange scene in front of him.

What was happening?

Even these cruel underwater killers became so docile? Furthermore, they gathered and took the initiative to stop the flowing river to open a path for these animals?

This was unbelievable\!

If they did not see it with their own eyes, who could believe it?

Chu Xiaoye brought the Chino brothers and followed the leopard family as they swam across the river and climbed to the opposite shore, continuing to run forward.

The three of them were really confused. They did not know what was happening or where they were going.

"Roar—"

He quickened his steps and caught up to the little leopard. He roared at her, wanting to ask her.

Belita turned her head and looked at him with slanted eyes, as if she was saying, "I won't tell you\! I won't tell you\!"

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and slapped her\!

Just as he was about to fight again, a sharp and ear-piercing scream suddenly came from above\!

Then, a group of snow-white snow eagles with a wingspan of more than three meters quickly landed and circled above them. Their sharp eyes stared at him coldly.

Chu Xiaoye's heart immediately turned cold and he felt his blood run cold.

As he ran, he looked up at the neat and murderous snow eagles, as if he was looking at a well-trained army\!

Their sharp claws and sharp mouths were like cold weapons that flickered with a cold luster under the evening sun\!

Chu Xiaoye was puzzled.

Could these birds be here to maintain order?

It seemed that if he attacked this little leopard again, this group of fierce sky killers might come down and beat him up.

No wonder there were so many animals mixed together but no killing happened.

However, who was it that gave these sky killers the right to maintain order? Furthermore, who made all the animals on this grassland so nervous and obedient?

Chu Xiaoye saw many super lion prides.

Every pride had about thirty members. The lion kings among them were huge and looked mighty and strong with a murderous aura.

However, at this moment, they were all like little soldiers listening to orders as they ran towards the distant snow mountain with grave expressions.

The rabbits also formed an army and jumped around, running excitedly in the herd.

Even if they accidentally landed on the lions and hyenas, they were still alive. No one dared to touch a hair on them.

In the sky, the loud and ear-piercing cry continued to sound.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. In the air, there was a group of snow eagles and some beautiful birds every few meters.

They were like orderly soldiers who were looking down at every beast group on the ground.

At the slightest chaos, they would let out high and rapid cries and quickly land, looking like they were preparing to attack.

Facing such a terrifying group of ferocious air troops, even the largest animal on the grassland had to be obedient and not dare to be impudent.

No matter how fast or strong you were, you could forget about escaping their pursuit in this open grassland.

The shock in Chu Xiaoye's heart was indescribable.

The Chino brothers, who were following behind him, were also dumbfounded by this spectacular and magical scene.

"Roar\!"

Belita turned around and bared her fangs at Chu Xiaoye fiercely, looking like she wanted to try hitting him again.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and raised his head to look ahead.

The running beasts gradually slowed down.

On the grassland in front of him, a high platform formed from many huge rocks suddenly appeared.

On the high platform, there was a thick and winding tree. The branches were green, but there was not a single leaf.

A snow-white goshawk landed from the sky and stood proudly on the top of the tree, looking at the huge beast pack with a dignified gaze.

The herd stopped dozens of meters away from the high platform and stood there respectfully, quieting down.

Standing at the front of the herd was an elephant alliance formed by many elephant herds.

Ten of the tallest elephants walked out of the elephant herd and walked towards the high platform. They stopped under the high platform and stood in neat rows with their heads raised, as if they were waiting for something.

Then, ten of the strongest rhinoceroses walked out of the rhinoceros herd and stood obediently behind the ten elephants.

Then, eighteen lion kings with lush manes and huge bodies walked out of the prides and stood behind the rhinoceros.

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto Belita's back and looked up. He actually saw the blue-eyed lion king among the eighteen lions.

His heart trembled. It seemed that the status of the blue-eyed lion king was extraordinary.

Belita was furious. She immediately rolled down from the ground and threw him down, letting out an angry roar.

The male leopard hurriedly turned around and stared at her in fear, telling her to shut up\!

At this moment, all the animals stopped in their tracks and the noise gradually quietened down.

Chu Xiaoye saw that they were all looking up at the tall stone platform with burning eyes, as if they were waiting for something.

Chu Xiaoye was even more curious.

Standing behind the eighteen lion kings were thirty hyena queens, and behind the hyena queens was a group of tall white wolves.

The leaders of many herbivores also stepped out of the crowd and stood in front.

Chu Xiaoye's vision was blocked by this dense group of animals. He looked around and decided to stand in the elephant pack in front. Otherwise, he could not see the situation clearly.

Until now, he was still confused and did not know what these animals were doing.

He passed through the zebras, the rabbits, the warthogs, and the giraffes. After a long time, he finally reached the elephant herd.

Suddenly, he discovered a familiar figure in the elephant herd. He was delighted and hurriedly ran over.

There were three to four hundred elephants in this group. Clearly, this was not all the elephants on the grassland.

The people who came here today seemed to be the main members of their tribes.

Amongst so many elephants, there was only one small elephant. As for the small elephant, it was wagging its nose and tail and looking around. It looked extremely bored and was incompatible with the entire elephant herd, looking exceptionally conspicuous.

When Chu Xiaoye ran behind it, the elephants surrounding it immediately looked at him warily, as if they were preparing to use their noses to throw him into the sky at any time\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the back of the little elephant.

The two elephants at the side immediately raised their noses and prepared to be rough.

The little elephant was also shocked and prepared to flare up.

However, when it saw that it was Chu Xiaoye, it immediately swung its nose and swayed its butt excitedly. Its two big ears trembled quickly, as if it was saying, "Brother\! You're finally here\! Quick\! Fart\! I want to eat your smelly fart\!"

Seeing its attitude, the two tall male elephants at the side immediately lowered their noses and looked at Chu Xiaoye strangely.

The female elephant in front turned around and nudged the little elephant's nose with her nose, signaling it to be quiet.

The little elephant seemed to be a little afraid of her and could only stop all sorts of excited movements.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on its back and raised his head, looking at the tall stone platform with a burning gaze. He secretly guessed what it was and how much prestige it had to command so many animals on the grassland.

The distant setting sun had already fallen to the horizon.

Tens of thousands of animals were gathered on the grassland, waiting quietly.

In the sky, there were still many killers circling in the air, but they were silent and did not let out any cries.

Chu Xiaoye felt more and more strange.

Was this still the world of animals?

From the grand and magical situation today, it was obvious that the animals on this grassland were not what he knew.

"Roar—"

A low and penetrating roar suddenly sounded from behind the stone platform\!

All the animals immediately perked up and raised their heads in unison, looking at the high platform with reverence.

Then, a tall lion with snow-white fur and a body like that of a water buffalo slowly appeared on the stone platform.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. Just as he thought that this was the main master, another two equally tall and mighty lions appeared and stood beside the previous one.

At the same time, more than twenty tall and mighty white lions suddenly appeared on the boulders on both sides of the stone platform\!

As soon as these white lions appeared, the elephant leader, the rhinoceros leader, the pride leader, and so on standing at the front let out cries, as if they were paying respect to a true lord.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the back of the little elephant and widened his eyes. He stared in shock at the group of huge and majestic lions\!

As far as he knew, the largest lion in the world was the extinct Cape Lion.

The Cape Lion was nearly 5 meters long and 1.5 meters tall. Its greatest weight might be more than 400 kilograms. It was a true super lion king.

Now, these white lions were even taller and stronger than those Cape lions. Every one of them was almost several times their weight. Their dense and thick manes, coupled with their huge heads, made all the animals tremble in fear at a glance\!

Even Chu Xiaoye was no exception\!

These white lions naturally exuded the aura of a king. Their arrogant and cold gazes carried an incomparable chill no matter who they looked at.

All the animals were silent at this moment\!

The three white lions standing on the platform looked at the animal leaders below the stage with a dignified gaze, then raised their heads to look at the beast pack behind them.

Suddenly, a white lion's gaze stopped on Chu Xiaoye.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was squatting on the back of the little elephant. Although he was surrounded by the tall elephants around him, he was clearly seen by the white lion on the platform.

He looked exceptionally striking.

A young lion was actually squatting on the back of a little elephant.

The white lion paused and carefully sized up this small and weak lion that was clearly an outsider.

Chu Xiaoye's hair turned cold. He immediately slipped down from the little elephant's back and hid under its stomach.

He just wanted to stand high and see clearly. He did not want to be noticed by this group of perverted white lions.

Clearly, they were the true rulers of this grassland.

Be it the lions, elephants, or other animals on the grassland, they all listened to them.

Chu Xiaoye did not know the exact situation, but he knew very well that these white lions had extremely terrifying strength and authority.

He had just defeated the blue-eyed lion king and obtained a new territory. He did not want to provoke trouble again.

On the high platform, the white lion's gaze immediately sank when it saw him slip away. Just as it was about to roar, a loud and clear cry suddenly came from the sky above the distant snow mountain, as if it was informing something.

The three white lions on the platform immediately raised their heads and roared in unison. Then, they turned around and walked towards the stone platform.

The animal leaders standing at the front immediately circled around the stone platform and followed the white lion team towards the distant snow mountain.

The other animals stayed in place and waited quietly.

In the sky, there were still birds circling and patrolling.

When Chu Xiaoye was lying on the grass in a daze, the little elephant immediately turned its head and slapped his butt with its long nose, letting out an impatient rumble.

He seemed to be saying, "Alright\! Brother, fart\!"
