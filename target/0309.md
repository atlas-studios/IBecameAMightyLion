Chapter 309: The Skill of the Cold Father

"Roar—"

The cold father's mane fluttered as he walked as if he was flying. He led the elderly pride and roared as he rushed over, looking unharmed\!

Xi'er was shocked.

Aisha and the others were also shocked.

Little Curly Tail widened his eyes in shock.

Of course.

The most shocked was Haas.

Looking at this lion that was supposed to have its brain broken and die actually running over alive, he wondered if he was dreaming.

He was very confident in his punch.

Furthermore, he had clearly heard the sound of the other party's skull shattering\!

However, what was going on now?

The cold father brought the team and ran over aggressively. Seeing that everyone was looking at him in disbelief, he thought that they had already submitted to his heroic and mighty aura. Hence, he was even more pleased.

He walked in front of Little Curly Tail, raised his claws, and mimicked his unfilial son. He patted this kid's head and told him not to be afraid. His father was here.

Little Curly Tail stood in place in a daze and looked at him motionless.

The cold father walked out of the crowd and looked at the golden-haired lion king opposite him. He let out a provocative roar, his eyes filled with ridicule, as if he was inviting the other party to give him another punch.

"Flowery fists are useless\! If you have the ability, come and punch me again?"

Haas froze in place and looked at him in bewilderment, not knowing what was wrong.

Of course, it was not because of his fist and strength.

Chu Xiaoye walked to the side of the cold father and sized him up. He did not seem to have changed, but his aura seemed to have become more confident.

He was very strange to begin with.

After the blood rain, everyone had mutated. Even the female lions were stronger and more agile. However, his father did not seem to have changed.

But now, it seemed that there were some changes that they did not know. Furthermore, they could not see them with the naked eye.

Where did it change?

Chu Xiaoye was filled with doubts, but he had no idea.

Little Curly Tail finally woke up and went in front of the cold father. He raised his claws and carefully rubbed his head with a look of disbelief.

"Bam\!"

The cold father slapped his claws away and turned his head to glare at him with a fierce expression.

"Unfilial son\! Do you think you can touch my head?"

Little Curly Tail did not care about his father's "impudence" and arrogance. He hurriedly raised his claws and rubbed his head, asking in confusion.

"Crack\!"

The cold father's answer was very simple.

He raised his right front leg and suddenly flicked it. The entire right front leg suddenly broke and drooped softly. He suddenly flicked it again and with a crack, it instantly healed\!

Before Little Curly Tail could roar in shock, the cold father suddenly swung his head. His entire neck actually broke with a crack and his head hung limply. Then, his entire body suddenly trembled. With a crack, his broken neck instantly healed\!

Little Curly Tail was dumbfounded.

However, he still could not understand.

"But, Dad, your head was clearly broken just now… Why aren't you dead yet?"

The cold father grinned and snorted coldly.

"A broken head is a broken head, and death is death. Those are two different matters. Furthermore, did you see my head break with your own eyes just now? You only heard the crack and thought that my head was broken. Don't you want me to die early? Unfilial son\!"

Little Curly Tail:"…"

His father was his father. His intelligence seemed to have increased too.

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief. Seeing that there were no casualties on his side, he looked at the golden-haired lion king again.

Now that he had evolved again, he really wanted to fight this golden-haired lion king to test his true combat strength.

However, the other party did not seem to have any fighting spirit.

Haas looked at him coldly and did not say anything else. He turned around and left with the pride, not pursuing the matter of them crossing the line and chasing the female lion.

The resurrection of the cold father made him uneasy. He had already lost tonight and could not continue to lose.

Otherwise, even the pride behind him would lose confidence in him.

Chu Xiaoye watched as they retreated and did not chase after them.

He never wanted to fight the other party's pride.

As the masters of this grassland, if they killed each other before they could defeat the black lions, the gains would not make up for the losses, giving the enemy a chance to take advantage of them.

What he wanted was more combat strength, not a group of corpses.

The most ideal outcome was naturally to defeat the golden-haired lion king and take this pride for his own use, merging it with his pride.

This way, he could really fight the black lions.

Now, he had to wait for the best opportunity.

They did not fight after a few confrontations.

The teams on both sides were a little tired and discouraged.

If this happened a few more times, everyone would probably not want to risk their lives against the other party again.

At that time, it would be a one-on-one battle and a small group would fight a small group to decide the victor or even the ownership of the other party's pride.

Chu Xiaoye was waiting for this opportunity.

He would try his best to exchange the smallest casualties for the greatest benefits.

Lars was a little seriously injured, but it was not fatal.

As for Little Curly Tail's broken leg, it had miraculously healed before he could return to the bushes while the kid was limping.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of the strange heat in his body.

Perhaps, the members of the pride of the cold father had benefited from him. Not only had their bodies been reborn, they could also heal their wounds on their own. They complemented the previous blood rain evolution and benefited more than ordinary evolvers.

The gathered pride dispersed.

The cold father left with the group of old lions and went to the territory again. He blew at the night wind, faced the moon, and accompanied his old friends to boast about today's deeds.

Chu Xiaoye used the bladder of an animal to fill some water and handed it to Lars.

His saliva was in the water.

This big brother's performance tonight was very good. Therefore, this bag of water was considered a reward.

The female lions were more or less injured, but it was not serious. With their current bodies, they should be fine after a nap.

Everyone returned to the bushes and were exhausted. They immediately lay down in the grass to rest.

Qiqi and Nunu were playing with the pit while Little Mi crawled into the bushes to find food.

The pride of the cold father did not eat these few days.

Chu Xiaoye decided to bring everyone to hunt tomorrow and eat a good meal.

Over the past few days, he recorded the numbers of all sorts of herbivores in the territory and realized that some were decreasing and were still decreasing quickly.

Over four hundred lions consumed an astonishing amount of food each time.

Now, there was another pride stationed in front of him. The herbivores on the grassland could not come over.

The growth of the herbivores here could not keep up with their consumption. Furthermore, they soon fled to the forest.

Therefore, it seemed that they were going to eat nothing.

The crisis of food would soon arrive.

However, Chu Xiaoye believed that at that time, the other team in front of him would have already become his.

At that time, the food on the entire grassland would be theirs\!

It was already late at night.

Chu Xiaoye was busy for the day and did not feel sleepy at all.

When he walked into the orchard and was about to find some fruits to eat, he suddenly saw Belia lying on the fruit tree in front of him. She was roaring, as if she was teaching the little white lion something.

The little white lion lay there obediently with its eyelids lowered and its eyes blinking. It looked shy and expectant.

Belita lay on the highest branch and covered her eyes in embarrassment. However, she would lower her head from time to time and sneak a glance, her face filled with curiosity.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He hurriedly turned around and left quietly.

Spring had arrived, and everything had revived. It was time for the little tadpoles to find their mothers…
