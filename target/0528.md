Chapter 528: DIY Sword Technique: Running Wild on a Pig\!

The fish tasted good.

Although it was a little fishy, the meat was fat, tender, and tight. There was also a sweet taste in his mouth. To Chu Xiaoye, who had not eaten meat for a long time, it was considered delicious.

In order to not raise smoke, they did not start a fire.

Chu Xiaoye asked for a dagger from Fei'er and cut the silver-white fish into pieces that were as thin as cicada wings and almost transparent. He dried them on the rock for a while before handing them to the little elves to enjoy.

For the elves, this raw fish was a little difficult to swallow.

Usually, they ate nectar, fruits, and plants. They had never eaten meat, so their taste buds and stomachs would definitely find it difficult to adapt to it.

However, this was not the time to be particular. They had to eat their fill in order to recover their strength and continue traveling.

Vilis almost did not chew and just frowned and swallowed it.

Lanisi mimicked Chu Xiaoye and tried to chew a few times. Then, she almost vomited and hurriedly swallowed it.

When Fei'er ate the first piece, her face was also filled with pain. She swallowed it in one bite. When she ate the second piece, she could chew a few times and swallow it again. Then, she said in surprise, "It doesn't seem to be that bad."

As for Denise, although she had eaten a few pieces, her face was calm and no emotions could be seen.

Chu Xiaoye ate the most and was the happiest. He did not even let go of the tail with sharp fish bones.

After eating and drinking his fill, he needed to rest.

They brought the horses to the grass in the valley and let them eat the grass.

They found a hidden cave on the stone wall beside the waterfall and hid in it to rest.

Although the roar of the waterfall was very loud, they were tired and quickly fell asleep in the cave.

Catherine slept at the entrance and paid attention to the movements outside.

The sun rose into the sky and gradually sank into the west.

When Chu Xiaoye woke up, the sky was already bright.

A round moon rose in the night sky. Bright moonlight shone on the flowing waterfall, forming a beautiful scene in the night.

The few female elves were still sleeping.

Chu Xiaoye quietly got up and walked out of the cave.

Catherine followed.

The horse on the grass not far away disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly brought Catherine down the stone wall and walked to the grass.

The surroundings were quiet. Other than the rumbling of the waterfall, there was no other sound.

He followed the stream and continued down. He suddenly realized that there was a pool of blood on the grass not far away.

His sense of smell was very sensitive. He continued forward along the blood trail and suddenly discovered the corpse of a horse in the rocks not far away.

However, the horse only had a white skeleton left and all the flesh on its body had been eaten.

Chu Xiaoye looked up, his eyes flickering with golden light as he looked at the forest further away.

Without horses, their journey would be even more difficult.

He looked back at the cave on the rock wall. It should be safer and easy to be discovered.

He continued forward with Catherine and walked towards the distant forest.

The ones who ate the horses should be wild beasts, but there were a total of five horses. It was impossible for all of them to be eaten.

He smelled the scent of blood and quickly walked forward. Soon, he came to the forest.

As soon as he entered the forest, he smelled an unfamiliar scent.

At the same time, Catherine, who was beside him, let out a low growl.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked behind him.

A strong lion the size of a rhinoceros appeared behind him, its amber eyes revealing a dark and cold killing intent.

Then, two lions of the same size appeared on his left and right.

In front of him, three human-like creatures slowly walked out from behind the tree.

Chu Xiaoye looked carefully. There was a thin and curved strange horn above their ears. Their appearance was no different from that of humans. They were wearing animal skin and had a short knife at their waists. From their dressing, they looked a little similar to orcs.

"Elves?"

One of the young girls said with an interested expression.

Chu Xiaoye held the sword at his waist and looked at them. "Orcs?"

The girl grinned and said, "Yes, but we're not from the Bolton Nation. We won't abduct you back to be a slave, nor will we humiliate you on the spot. Let's discuss something, okay?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and did not speak.

The girl pointed at Catherine beside him and said, "Give me this lioness cub. Our war beast needs her. Then, you can leave. This request is not too much, right?"

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and pointed at her. "Give yourself to my younger brother. My younger brother needs you. This way, your two friends and your battle beast can leave. This request isn't too much, right?"

The girl was stunned for a moment and said, "Your younger brother?"

Chu Xiaoye pointed at his crotch.

"You're courting death\!"

The girl's expression immediately changed and she was furious. She roared and said angrily, "Qie Er, tear him apart\!"

"Roarâ€”"

With a roar, the huge lion behind suddenly opened its bloody mouth and pounced at Chu Xiaoye\!

"Whoosh\!"

However, before it could pounce close, there was a sudden silver flash and Catherine had already passed by it, like a silver bolt of lightning that cut through the night sky\!

"Bang\!"

The lion fell heavily to the ground. Blood surged and internal organs flowed all over the ground.

It let out a miserable scream and twitched a few times, dying completely.

This scene immediately frightened the two lions preparing to pounce on him from the left and right.

The expressions of the three orcs in front of Chu Xiaoye changed and they were shocked.

The orc girl was stunned for a moment. Her originally ugly face suddenly revealed excitement. She stared at Catherine, who was as fast as lightning, with a burning gaze and praised, "Good skills\!"

Catherine looked at her coldly and walked behind Chu Xiaoye.

"Is this your war beast? Have you signed a contract with her?"

The orc girl asked eagerly.

Chu Xiaoye did not answer her and pulled out the sword at his waist.

He knew that this battle was inevitable. Catherine's performance just now made this orc girl drool even more. She was probably determined to win.

The girl stared at him coldly and said, "Kid, don't refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit\! I'll ask you again, did you sign a contract with this lioness\! If not, I can spare your life\!"

Chu Xiaoye said, "I signed a contract with your mother\!"

The girl was stunned when she heard this. After a few seconds, she realized that he was cursing. With a bang, she pulled out the short knife at her waist and ran towards him. She said angrily, "Kid, I want to see if your mouth is harder than my knife\!"

The two orcs behind the girl also pulled out the short blades at their waists, but they did not rush up immediately.

The girl jumped up, held the short knife in her hand, and slashed at Chu Xiaoye. Her movements were fierce, exceptionally fierce, and very fast\!

Chu Xiaoye did not swing his sword to take it head-on. Instead, he suddenly took a few steps back and avoided this ferocious slash first. When the orc girl was about to land, he suddenly held his sword with both hands and suddenly spun his body, jumping up. Like a rapidly spinning whirlwind, he slashed at the orc girl who had just landed\!

The orc girl could only swing her saber to resist.

"Clang\!"

The blades collided and sparks flew\!

The short knife in the orc girl's hand suddenly broke\!

As for the sword in Chu Xiaoye's hand, it still slashed at her body with terrifying strength\!

The orc girl's expression changed and her reaction was exceptionally fast. The moment the short knife in her hand split open, her upper body suddenly leaned back and her two hands supported the ground behind her. Her entire upper body and lower body collided and she narrowly avoided the swift and fierce sword\!

When Chu Xiaoye's sword slashed past her, his body spun again. After quickly spinning the sword in his hand, he slashed at her again\!

However, the orc girl had already quickly somersaulted a few meters away.

Chu Xiaoye stomped his feet and protected the sword that was still spinning. He looked at her and said, "It seems that my sword is stronger."

He was secretly surprised. The move just now was completely seen by the huge sword loli and was used now. He did not expect to use it immediately. Furthermore, it was much stronger than usual and the speed of his sword was much faster.

It seemed that the swordplay of the giant sword loli was indeed not fake.

"Rotating Storm\! Are you the disciple of the Great Swordmaster of the elves?"

The orc girl said with a dark expression.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. He thought for a moment and realized that she was referring to the giant sword loli. He said, "Do you know her?"

The orc girl snorted coldly and said, "We've fought before, but she lost to me\!"

"Carter, who do you think is the loser?"

Suddenly, Vilis, Lanisi, and the others walked in.

Denise and Fei'er aimed their arrows at the orc girl.

The orc girl's expression changed slightly, but she sneered and said, "Vilis, it's really you. Little Shortie, have you started to take in disciples too?"

Not only was Vilis not angry, she was also smiling. She walked over and rubbed Chu Xiaoye's head, as if her master was praising his disciple. She said proudly, "Why? Do you feel very aggrieved, ashamed, and want to kill yourself after being defeated by my disciple?"

Chu Xiaoye slapped the little girl's tender face.

Vilis was already prepared. She tilted her head and dodged. Then, she jumped two steps to the side and looked at the orc girl with a smile. "This disciple of mine has a bad temper, but his sword skills can definitely kill you. Carter, do you want to try again?"

The orc girl did not want to humiliate herself. She sneered and said, "You have a lot of people. You're right. Vilis, aren't you afraid that I'll tell the orcs in the Bolton Kingdom?"

Vilis said, "Just go. If I'm not wrong, you sneaked into the Bolton Kingdom this time probably because you saw that they had transferred the border army back and wanted to investigate the situation. Then, you can use this opportunity to bring your troops across the border to attack, right?"

The orc girl's eyelids twitched and she looked at her coldly without saying anything.

She looked at the other elven girls and stopped at the red-haired Lanisi. Her eyes revealed a hint of confusion and she said, "This isâ€¦ the Flame Princess, Lanisi?"

Then, she said, "No, she should be called the Flame Queen now, right?"

The orc girl's face revealed shock. She looked at their group and said, "I heard that you wiped out the orc army of twenty thousand in the battle a few days ago. This really exceeded all of our expectations. However, where are you going now? Furthermore, Her Majesty the Queen actually took action personally."

She muttered to herself and suddenly said, "Move elite troops? The Bolton Kingdom's army is gathering to deal with you. You know that you're no match for them and should indeed go and get reinforcements. However, you've long been cut off from the world and have no contact with the outside world, let alone any friends. Who will help you?"

This orc girl was rather smart. Even if Vilis and the others did not speak, she could guess most of their actions this time.

"None of your business\!"

Vilis suddenly pulled out the sword on her shoulder and looked at her coldly.

The two men behind the orc girl immediately held the short knife in their hands and protected her. They whispered, "General, leave first\!"

It turned out that this orc girl was actually a general of another orc country.

"Vilis, if I were you, I would not kill the enemy of an enemy at this time."

The orc girl mocked.

Indeed, they belonged to the Kast orc kingdom and were neighbors with the Bolton Kingdom. Furthermore, they were mortal enemies and often fought each other to snatch each other's cities.

If she really came here to investigate the enemy of the Bolton Kingdom and prepared to attack the Bolton Kingdom with her troops, it would definitely be a very beneficial thing for the elves.

Because at that time, the orcs of Bolton would be terrified, or they would retreat from the elves and give up attacking the elves, or they would scatter their forces.

Either way, it was beneficial for the elves.

Furthermore, the Kast orcs had never coveted the elves. Although there had been some friction between them, they had never formed a deep hatred.

"Vilis, forget it."

Lanisi also thought of this.

Now that the Elf Kingdom was in danger and there was already a terrifying orc kingdom beside them, it would be even more dangerous if they angered the Kast Orc Kingdom.

This orc girl was not only the general of the border army of the Kast Orc Kingdom, but was also said to be Kast's royalty. She was definitely especially important to the Kast Orc Kingdom.

Vilis put away her sword and still stared at the orc girl with an unkind gaze.

The girl did not waste her gaze on her again. Instead, she looked at Chu Xiaoye and the female lion beside him and suddenly said, "Give me that female lion. I can attack the Bolton Kingdom in advance\!"

Chu Xiaoye replied, "Give me your mother. I can let Tibbs attack your mother in advance\!"

The orc girl: "???"

Lanisi held in her laughter and explained, "Tibbs is a big black bear."

The orc girl clenched her fists and looked hatefully at the youth in front of her. She gritted her teeth and said, "Kid\! Just you wait\! One day, we will meet again\! At that time, I will make you beg for death\!"

After saying that, she cupped her hands at Lanisi and said, "Goodbye\!"

If she did not leave now, would she stay to eat swords?

The orc girl left in a hurry with her two guards.

After she disappeared into the forest, Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "Let's go and leave this place quickly. We can only believe in ourselves now. If we believe that she won't tell on us, we'll be idiots."

Vilis said, "I believe it\! She doesn't dare to tell on us at all\! If the orcs discover her, the first person they will kill is her\!"

"Then you're a fool."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her as if she was an idiot and said, "If she really wanted to tell on me, would she need to see the orcs in the Bolton Kingdom personally? She only needs to leave a letter at the path that the orcs have to pass."

Vilis frowned and stopped talking.

However, the huge sword loli suddenly reacted and grabbed his arm, questioning, "Are you my disciple? If not, why did Carter say that just now? You cut her knife with my sword technique, right?"

Although she came late and did not see the battle between the two, she could guess something when she saw the broken sword on the ground and heard what the orc girl said.

Chu Xiaoye shook off her hand and said disdainfully, "I'm the dignified Lord Night of the Elven Kingdom. Would I use your sword technique? That's a sword technique I created myself. Nine Solitary Sword, the sword seals the throat and is invincible\!"

"Nine Solitary Sword?"

Vilis was stunned for a moment. "Why haven't I heard of it?"

Chu Xiaoye mocked, "There are many things you haven't heard of. Have you heard of the Evil Warding Sword Technique? Have you heard of the six divine swords? Have you heard of the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Swords? Have you heard of how cheap you are?"

Vilis widened her eyes in a daze and said, "Noâ€¦"

"That's right\!"

Chu Xiaoye said proudly, "These sword techniques were created by me after thinking hard these few days. Every sword technique has been tempered a thousand times and is invincible\!"

"Tempered a thousand times?"

Beside him, Lanisi looked at him suspiciously.

Chu Xiaoye pointed at his head and said, "I've practiced it thousands of times in my mind. I'm already familiar with it and used to it."

Fei'er's face was filled with excitement as she looked at him and said impatiently, "Lord Night is so powerful\! Can you play and let Fei'er broaden her horizons?"

Vilis also sneered. "Yes, play around. Everyone knows how to say it, but not everyone knows how to play on the hand."

Chu Xiaoye said in all seriousness, "My sword technique can only be used against enemies. When I attack, I must kill. When I kill, I attack. You're not my enemies, and I can't use them."

"Tsk, stop bragging\!"

Vilis finally understood. This fellow had been talking nonsense.

However, she had just cut off Carter's saber and made him think that she had taught him the sword technique. How did she do it?

Without the horses, they could only walk.

Fortunately, the night was not bad and they could still see somewhat clearly in the forest. There was no problem traveling.

"Lanisi, do you really know the way?"

Walking in the forest without a path, Chu Xiaoye could not help but ask.

An awkward expression appeared on the Queen's face. "I only know the general direction. During the day, I might have known a big road. Now, I don't know where that road is."

Alright, so it was another stupid one.

They did not even know the way and were still traveling in a hurry.

Catherine, who was beside Chu Xiaoye, said, "Climb up the tree and see if there's a main road nearby."

Catherine immediately rushed out and climbed up a big tree in front of her. She climbed to the highest point and looked at the surrounding forest.

After a moment, she climbed down and wagged her tail, indicating that she did not see the way.

That would be troublesome.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the sword in his hand and said, "If we continue to open the way like this, I'm afraid that we won't encounter any enemies yet. The sword in my hand is going to be blunt. How can I protect you then?"

Vilis followed behind and fiddled with the thorns with the hilt of her sword. She reminded mockingly, "You're good at schemes and schemes, not the sword in your hand. You have to know your limits, or you won't be able to survive. No one knows why."

"Because you're the most despicable\!"

Chu Xiaoye retorted angrily.

This girl always attacked him. Damn it. When did he provoke her?

Vilis was stunned for a moment before she said with a clear memory, "Wasn't your best sword technique a sword technique you created? Why did you lose your life because of this sword technique? It seems that your lie has already been exposed by yourself."

"Scram\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not want to care about her anymore. He tried but still could not become a lion.

This path was really infuriating.

It was too difficult\!

"Night, why don't we find a place to rest?"

Lanisi felt a little guilty. She did not know how she left and actually brought everyone here.

There were thorns and short trees everywhere. They were dense and could not be turned around at all. They could only open the path bit by bit.

"Vilis, lead the way\!"

Chu Xiaoye stopped and ordered.

Vilis immediately said, "Why me?"

Chu Xiaoye glared and said, "I thought you were talkative\!"

The huge sword loli immediately said, "No\!"

Chu Xiaoye added, "Because you're born with divine strength and are a warrior. You're the bravest, most skilled, and most suitable to open the way."

"Whoosh\!"

Vilis pulled out her sword and cut the thorns in front of her. As she walked forward, she waved the huge sword in her hand and snorted. "A mere thorn dares to be arrogant? Let me, Lady Vilis, deal with you\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Vilis swung her huge sword and was very fast. The thorns and short trees she cut were broken into pieces and broken limbs flew everywhere\!

"Good sword technique\!"

Chu Xiaoye clapped and exclaimed from behind.

Vilis worked even harder and let out a flaunting roar. "Little thief\! Give me your life\! Take my anger\!"

"Wow\! Lady Vilis is so powerful\!"

Chu Xiaoye continued to clap and marvel, but his face was expressionless.

Vilis walked forward at lightning speed, the huge sword in her hand spinning like a propeller. She killed the thorns and short trees until they cried for their mothers and fathers.

An hour later, they finally walked out of the thorny forest.

As for Vilis, she hugged her sword and knelt on the ground. Her face was red and she was panting with sweat.

Catherine climbed up a big tree in front of her and looked around for a while. She jumped down and came to Chu Xiaoye's side. She looked at him with her dark eyes and slowly swung her tail.

"There's a small path over there that leads in the same direction as the one Her Majesty mentioned."

Chu Xiaoye translated for the few elven girls.

Then, he said to the exhausted Vilis, "Lady Vilis finally doesn't have to be tired."

"You bastard\!"

At this moment, Lady Vilis finally realized that this fellow had been treating her as a laborer.

However, if Chu Xiaoye did not join this team, she would naturally be the coolie in front. She was a warrior and should naturally walk in front and charge.

"This is called making the best use of everything. We can't waste it."

"You bastard, do you treat me as an object?"

"With your understanding, you can only do manual labor."

"Watch my fist\!"

"Aiya, Lady Vilis, you hit Fei'er\!"

The two of them were playing crazily and chasing after Fei'er and the other two. They did not seem to be carrying a heavy responsibility and traveling. Instead, they seemed to be playing around and enjoying themselves.

It was much easier to walk on the path.

Of course, danger would follow.

Four beautiful and cute girls and a short youth were naturally much more striking as they walked.

If they encountered a situation in front of them, they would enter the forest and ravine at the side in advance to hide.

Catherine walked in front and helped scout the way. Her sharp eyes could see very far in the night, and her sensitive ears could hear very far.

However, some ambushes could only be discovered when one walked close.

When they walked to a three-pronged intersection, a few big men suddenly jumped out from the bushes at the side and shouted, "I opened this mountain and planted this tree. If we want to hit this roadâ€¦"

Before he could finish shouting, Chu Xiaoye said, "Let's not pass by here. Let's go through the forest at the side."

With that, he left the path with Lanisi and the others and walked into the forest, preparing to pass through there.

The five big men were stunned for a moment before they hurriedly brandished the knives in their hands and chased after him.

These were five humans. They were tall, strong, and had fierce faces. They looked rather strong, but they were far inferior to most orcs.

"Stop\!"

The five big men jumped and stopped in front of them.

"Eh? Beautiful girls? Elves?"

"There's also a beautiful lolita\! Haha, I like it\!"

"Damn\! There's also a little boy\! I like him more\!"

When the five human men saw their appearance, they were extremely excited and let out strange laughs.

"Clang\!"

Vilis pulled out the huge sword on her shoulder and was about to slash over when she suddenly looked at Chu Xiaoye beside her and said, "These five are trash. You do it\!"

This was the first time Chu Xiaoye had seen a human at such a close distance since he was a lion. He could not bear to attack and persuaded the five of them, "Five good men, we have our principles as thieves. It's okay to be bandits, but you have to follow the rules and not forget your original intentions. It's fine if you rob the rich, but how can you rob us poor and cute little elves? Doesn't your conscience hurt?"

"Conscience?"

One of the burly men with a scraggly beard rubbed his chest and said, "Of course it will hurt. However, our conscience will only hurt if we let go of you cute little elves\!"

"Hahahahahahaâ€¦"

The other four men laughed.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he had no choice but to attack. However, he was not confident in fighting one against five. He could only turn around and say to the few elven girls, "Do it, quickly settle it and hurry up."

"Whoosh\!"

Just as they finished speaking, Denise and Fei'er's arrows had already flown out and pierced into the throats of the two big men. One arrow sealed their throats\!

The laughter from the two big men immediately stopped and they fell to the ground.

When the other three men saw this, they were shocked. They turned around and ran. At the same time, they shouted, "Help\! The elves killed someone\! The elves killed someone\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's second arrows flew out.

The sword in the huge sword loli's hand also flew out with a whoosh and was as fast as the two arrows. With a puff, it pierced into the back of one of the men and pierced through his body.

The three running men fell to the ground.

Vilis walked over, pulled out her sword, and looked at Chu Xiaoye. "I originally wanted you to show me your self-created sword technique that you bragged about, but from the looks of it, there's no need. You don't have to explain. Everyone knows."

Chu Xiaoye still shamelessly explained, "The enemy is too weak and my sword is too strong. Why use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?"

The cries of the five big men might attract other people.

Therefore, they could not stay here for long. Lanisi immediately pointed at a small path at the crossroad. "I remember that direction."

Hence, the few of them immediately walked up the path.

After walking for about a mile, Catherine, who was walking in front, suddenly stopped, turned around, and ran back.

"There are Orcs in front\!"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and immediately made them stop. Then, he followed Catherine up the steep hill and looked forward.

There was a tunnel more than 200 meters ahead with steep mountains on both sides. There was a group of orcs guarding the tunnel with weapons in their hands. From the clothes on their bodies, they did not look like the soldiers in the orc army last night but like some ordinary orcs.

After the nearby orc tribes heard the news of the Elven Queen escaping, they probably spontaneously organized themselves to guard the intersection, wanting to gain some credit.

Chu Xiaoye counted carefully. There were a total of 18 orcs, and a few of them had similar faces. There were also women, and they were probably from the same family.

According to Lanisi, this should be the only way out, and that tunnel should lead outside the mountain. If they were obstructed here, they could only return. On the way back, they would definitely encounter those orc armies.

Then, there was only one way.

Chu Xiaoye quietly retracted his head and returned with Catherine. He came in front of the few elven girls and said, "Just like that night, Fei'er and I will lure them away. The few of you charge over first and wait for us in front."

Fei'er nodded and checked the bow in her hand.

Vilis hurriedly said, "Let me go this time. I can't let Fei'er be in danger forever."

Chu Xiaoye said rudely, "Your legs are too short and you can't run fast. Furthermore, you're short and your hair is silver. You're also carrying a sword. You don't look like an elf queen at all."

Vilis said angrily, "Your legs are short\! Then let me go with Fei'er. Protect His Majesty and leave\!"

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a moment before saying, "Vilis, my swordsmanship is inferior to yours. You're the most suitable to be by Her Majesty's side."

Then, before she could retort, she said to Fei'er, "Let's go."

Then, he brought Fei'er and left quickly.

Catherine followed behind him. She was still like his shadow on the grassland and never left his side.

Vilis wanted to say something but hesitated. She looked at his retreating figure with a complicated expression. She was stunned for a few seconds before she said to Lanisi, "Your Majesty, let's follow."

Lanisi nodded and brought the two of them to quickly follow. Then, she hid in the bushes beside the steep hill.

Chu Xiaoye brought Fei'er up the steep slope and walked towards the group of orcs.

When they walked more than 100 meters away, the orcs who were chatting and laughing finally discovered them. They first fixed their eyes and looked carefully, then suddenly shouted, "It's elves\!"

Hence, all the orcs held their weapons and stood up, looking at them excitedly and in shock.

Chu Xiaoye brought Fei'er and still walked over quickly. He said loudly, "I surrender\! Please don't hurt me\! The Elven Queen is behind me\! I brought her here\!"

"Elven Queen\!"

The moment this was said, the orcs were excited and immediately rushed over.

Seeing that all the orcs had run over, Chu Xiaoye turned around and winked at Fei'er behind him.

Fei'er immediately turned around and ran a few steps. She suddenly jumped up and jumped lightly into the forest at the side. Then, she quickly ran into the depths of the forest. Her pink hair fluttered and she was as agile as a deer.

Chu Xiaoye also jumped and chased after her, shouting, "Everyone, chase\! Don't let the Elven Queen escape\!"

The orcs held their weapons and roared as they chased into the forest.

At this moment, Lanisi and the other two, who were hiding at the foot of the steep hill, saw that there was no one guarding the road. They immediately got up and ran over.

There was a tunnel ahead. After they entered the tunnel, they stopped inside.

If Chu Xiaoye and Fei'er could not come over, they would definitely return to find them.

The tunnel was very long and it was dark inside. He could only vaguely see a trace of light in front of him.

The three female elves stayed inside silently.

Suddenly, footsteps came from the other end of the tunnel.

At the same time, the voices of a few orcs sounded.

"It is said that hundreds of people were mobilized, even the light cavalry. They still did not catch the Elven Queen. The Great General was furious."

"I heard that there was only an elf youth beside the Elven Queen. Say, are those soldiers all trash? No wonder the Great General was furious and killed dozens of people at once."

"Father, is the Elven Queen beautiful?"

"Hahaha, needless to say\! In the eyes of us orcs, none of the female elves are not beautiful. That Elven Queen is said to have red hair, a slender and tall figure, and an extremely sexy chest. If you see it, you'll definitely drool."

"Tsk tsk, Gulp."

"Locke, who told you that the Elven Queen has red hair? Why did I hear that the Elven Queen has pink hair and is wearing a pink dress? She's beautiful and cute and carries a bow. She's as light and soft as a deer?"

"Bullsh\*t\! The Elven Queen clearly has red hair. It's said that a while ago, she was only a princess of the elves and only ascended to the throne after personally killing her mother. How could she be pink-haired?"

"No, I only heard it this morning. Furthermore, it was personally spread by those soldiers last night. They all said that the Elven Queen had pink hair and was very beautiful. The young man beside her was also very brave. He snatched the horse in the army and saved the Elven Queen. There's no mistake\!"

"Hmph\! Those soldiers are definitely color blind\! They can't see anything at night\! They can't even tell pink and red. They probably can't even tell the color under their wives."

"Hahahahaâ€¦"

"Damn, I really want to see that Elven Queen with my own eyes and see her hair and beautiful body."

A few orcs spoke and walked forward with a laugh.

Just as he was about to walk out of the tunnel, a cold voice suddenly came from the darkness beside him. "Do you really want to see her?"

"Pfft\!"

A cold dagger pierced through the throat of one of the orcs.

"Father, youâ€¦"

Just as the other orc was about to speak, another dagger suddenly pierced into his neck.

Seeing that the situation was bad, the remaining two orcs turned around and ran back the way they came, shouting, "Help\! Murder\! Murder\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Two sharp arrows shot out and pierced through their hearts from behind.

Denise and Fei'er's arrows were accurate even in the darkness as long as they could hear.

The two running orcs fell to the ground and died.

"It seems that the news has already reached here. If Night and Fei'er encounter an orc army, it will be troublesome."

Lanisi put away her dagger and said worriedly.

Vilis was silent for a moment before she said, "Your Majesty, why don't you let Denise stay here to protect you and I go out to pick them up?"

Lanisi pondered for a moment before shaking her head. "Let's listen to Night. Since he's confident, let's wait here. Don't let them return and you disappear again."

Vilis was a little unwilling to accept this, but she stopped talking.

Then, after waiting for about half an hour, there was still no movement outside.

The three elven girls in the tunnel started to worry.

Vilis suddenly got up and said, "Your Majesty, I'll go out and take a look. It's at the entrance of the tunnel."

Lanisi frowned and was silent for a moment before saying, "Let's go together."

As he spoke, he held the sword at his waist and walked out first.

Denise followed closely behind her.

Just as the three of them walked out of the cave, they saw noisy footsteps and roars coming from the forest not far away.

"Catch them\! Don't let them escape\!"

Then, the two familiar figures suddenly appeared in their vision.

Behind the two figures were more than ten flustered orcs with weapons.

Two of the orcs were actually riding two wild boars. They were especially fast and chased after Fei'er, their spears almost touching Fei'er's back.

Vilis hurriedly pulled out her sword and prepared to run over to receive him.

Denise also took an arrow and strung it, preparing to save him.

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye, who was following beside Fei'er, suddenly spun and actually flew backward. The sword in his hand spun a few times quickly with a whoosh. The first circle cut off the spears in the two orcs' hands, the second circle flew in front of the orcs, and the third circle cut off the heads of the two orcs\!

He landed steadily on one of the wild boars and stabbed the wild boar's butt with the sword in his hand. The wild boar jumped up even faster with a whoosh and let out a miserable roar. It actually hit Fei'er's butt\!

Fei'er was caught off guard and suddenly fell back, landing on the wild boar's neck.

Chu Xiaoye grabbed her chest and pulled her up.

The three female elves standing at the entrance of the tunnel were dumbfounded.

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye stabbed the wild boar's butt again. The wild boar flew out of the forest with a whoosh and landed on the path.

Chu Xiaoye slapped its head and made it change directions. Like a swift arrow, he carried the two of them and roared as he rushed into the tunnel\!

"Three idiots\! Run\!"

Seeing that they were actually standing there foolishly, Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily.

"Run\!"

Lanisi woke up and immediately turned to run.

Denise and Vilis hurriedly turned around and ran.

However, how could they outrun crazy wild boars?

Chu Xiaoye and Fei'er rode the roaring wild boar and jumped past them. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the darkness and disappeared.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine also rushed over like lightning and disappeared.
