Chapter 110: Return

"Whoosh—"

When the two wandering lions were about to approach, Chu Xiaoye no longer hesitated and suddenly shot out, pouncing on them\!

He would not let these two fellows approach Maya and the children\!

The two wandering lions suddenly stopped in their tracks. Clearly, they did not expect this cub to dare to pounce on them.

He was courting death\!

They immediately bared their fangs and charged forward ferociously.

Chu Xiaoye had just pounced in front of the two wandering lions when he suddenly stopped in his tracks and jumped out from the side.

The two wandering lions were stunned. Just as they thought he was going to escape, he suddenly turned around and jumped up from the side, pouncing ferociously\!

His movements were as fast as lightning\!

Before the wandering lion on the right could turn around, Chu Xiaoye had already pounced forward. With a bang, he suddenly slapped its open mouth\!

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

The fangs that the wandering lion bared were broken by a slap and blood flew out of its mouth.

As for it, its head tilted and it fell to the ground. It saw stars and had a confused expression.

Chu Xiaoye succeeded in his attack and immediately retreated. With a whoosh, he circled behind another wandering lion\!

The wandering lion was frightened and hurriedly turned around. It roared angrily with a trembling voice and looked terrified.

However, Chu Xiaoye was even faster. He turned around and suddenly slapped the end of its spine at the root of its tail\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The wandering lion suddenly jumped up and jumped three feet high. It let out a miserable roar\!

Then, he landed on the ground, lowered his tail, and ran away like a stray dog\!

The wandering lion, whose fangs had been broken, did not dare to stay any longer when it saw this scene. It hurriedly got up from the ground, its mouth full of blood, and followed closely. It fled, but fell a few times and crawled away in fear\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned in place and could not react.

Did he run away just like that?

He was preparing to use his speed and endurance to tire out these two adult lions for a while until they were exhausted and could not move. Then, he would pounce on them and bite them with a fatal blow\!

Who knew that it would end before it even started?

He raised his right palm and looked at his palm. It was empty and there were no claws, but there was a warm current surging in it, making his strength just now seem to have suddenly increased a lot.

He kept feeling that something was about to surge out from the roots of those broken claws.

The two wandering lions had clearly been hungry for too long and were extremely weak. However, their strength could not be underestimated.

However, he slapped them away with just two random swipes, making him a little stunned.

Maya, who was standing not far away, looked at him in a daze, clearly shocked.

She was already prepared to risk her life.

In the end…

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the roars of the two wandering lions suddenly sounded from afar\!

They fled but suddenly encountered a female cub with something in its mouth\!

They were overjoyed\!

Their failure just now made them angry and furious. They were furious at this half-grown cub\!

Therefore, the moment they saw this female cub, they immediately bared their fangs and roared\!

They immediately restored their masculinity and charged forward majestically with a murderous aura\!

Then, in less than two seconds, their faces were covered in blood and they fled with their tails between their legs again\!

"Wu…"

This time, they let out miserable and desperate cries.

This female cub was even more vicious\!

She immediately gave two swipes and almost scratched off half of their faces\!

They had no chance to react\!

What was wrong with this world?

As adult lions, why could they not even defeat an underage cub?

Each one was more perverted than the other\!

This damn god, was he going to let them live?

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to go and see the situation, Catherine had already returned with a water bag in her mouth with a calm expression.

It was as if what happened just now had nothing to do with her.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her, took the water bag from her mouth, and walked towards Maya.

Catherine froze in place and grinned, her body trembling slightly. She was so excited that she could not control herself.

Just now…

He was actually so close to her and even used his mouth to bite the thing she had bitten.

She was so happy that she almost fainted\!

Maya was afraid.

Not only was she afraid that the two wandering lions would return, but she was also afraid of these two terrifying cubs.

No, she could not stay alone with them anymore.

She decided to return to the pride.

At least in the pride, with her king and the other lionesses around, it would indeed be safer.

She quickly drank some water and walked to the mouth of the cave, calling out to the two young cubs.

She looked up at Chu Xiaoye, her eyes filled with hesitation, but she had no choice but to make a decision.

She lowered her head and bit the neck of one cub, then looked at the other cub.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he immediately understood. He hurriedly walked over and carefully probed a few times before he gently bit the neck of another cub and picked it up.

Maya looked up at him with a complicated gaze and gestured for him to leave.

She wanted to follow behind and pay attention to her children.

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and returned to the pride's camp.

When they approached the bushes, Chu Xiaoye did not enter but circled around to the grassland at the side.

Maya was a little bewildered and quickly followed him.

This was where Callie's three children had been cruelly killed in the past.

She still had a lingering fear. She stared intently at the other child in Chu Xiaoye's mouth, afraid that this kid would suddenly bite her child's neck with a crack.

For the sake of these two children, she was already a little absent-minded and crazy. She looked at everyone like they were thieves.

After walking halfway, Chu Xiaoye took the initiative to stop, lowered his head, and opened his mouth. He put the cub down to rest for a while.

As soon as the cub he was biting landed on the ground, it pounced on his legs energetically, scratching and biting. It was very lively.

Chu Xiaoye raised his other foot and fiddled with her tail. She immediately pounced at his other foot and looked very happy.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes were filled with smiles. Just as he was about to continue teasing her, Catherine, who was following beside him, suddenly let out a low growl. She bared her fangs and looked at the bushes not far away.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. He looked up and saw a pair of dark and cold eyes staring at them from a patch of grass in the bushes.

Catherine seemed to feel a great threat and her entire body was tense. She looked very nervous.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate and hurriedly picked up the cubs that were playing on his legs, signaling Maya to leave quickly.
