Chapter 100: Brothers

Little Curly Tail was very sad.

His brother no longer loved him and was very rough with him.

His brother beat his body but the pain was in his heart.

Had his brother's love been transferred to the two annoying female lions?

Wu…

Little Curly Tail felt the sky turn dark and his heart was filled with despair.

He hung his head and crawled into the bushes at the back sadly, his eyes filled with tears of grievance.

He no longer bothered with his brother.

His brother was a violent person and an ungrateful person\!

Wasn't it just a piece of meat\!

Even if he, Little Curly Tail, did not need his brother's help, he could still eat it\!

He was hungry.

He decided to hunt alone\!

At that time, he must make his brother look at him in a different light\! He must let his brother know that only he, Little Curly Tail, was worthy of calling him brother\!

Those two little female lions were not worthy at all\!

Hmph\!

Thinking of the shock and praise his brother would give him when he returned from hunting, Little Curly Tail's steps started to sway\!

He wanted to be self-reliant\!

He wanted his brother to stop looking down on him\!

He wanted his brother to love him wholeheartedly in the future\!

He had to work hard and become stronger and more useful\!

Only in this way would his brother not mind him in the future. He could then follow his brother to conquer the grassland, expand his borders, and dominate the land\!

Based on his strength and his brother's intelligence, this grassland would belong to them in the future\!

Thinking excitedly, his steps were light. He could not help but open his mouth and swing his tail vigorously.

His dream was ahead. He, Little Curly Tail, had to succeed\!

Unknowingly, he had already walked out of the bushes.

There was no prey left in the bushes now, and they could only continue to search the grassland in front.

The territory of the cold father's pride was very small.

Little Curly Tail desperately wanted to catch prey so that he could bring it back and show off in front of his brother.

Hence, he stepped out of the borders of the territory and walked further away.

There was a swamp ahead.

The mud inside had already dried up and the mud was cracked into pieces.

Little Curly Tail hesitated for a moment, crossed the swamp, and continued forward.

The weather was hot.

His mouth was open, and he was panting, tired and hungry, and hot and anxious.

However, he did not give up and continued forward.

After crossing a hill full of withered grass, he was finally so tired that he could not walk.

At this moment, the wind on the other side of the hill suddenly brought with it a slightly cool aura and a dense stench.

Little Curly Tail was shocked. He hurriedly increased his strength and climbed up the hill to look down.

At the foot of the hill, on the grassland not far away, there was a herd of cows and sheep eating grass.

The cows and sheep looked stupid and did not have any vigilance. No leading cows or sheep were guarding the outer circle.

They looked very relaxed, as if they never knew what danger was.

Little Curly Tail was extremely excited when he saw this\!

There were so many prey\!

There were so many stupid prey\!

He could finally make him look at him in a different light\!

He was extremely excited, and his entire body was immediately filled with strength. He hurriedly ran down the hill.

At this moment, he suddenly saw a few thin and tall upright animals with bright red fur standing outside the cows and sheep.

Those animals were holding some strange things in their hands and roaring, revealing their white teeth. They were not sharp at all and looked extremely weak, inferior to monkeys.

Although these animals looked easy to catch, they were dry and thin. They definitely did not have much meat. It was better to catch little lambs.

Little Curly Tail lowered his body and quickly approached.

They were really a group of stupid and silly animals. They did not have any defences at all. He did not know how they survived until now.

He decided to bring his brother and mother here when the time came. They could have a sumptuous meal every day\!

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, something suddenly jumped out from the grass under his feet and clamped his legs\!

An intense pain suddenly assaulted him\!

Little Curly Tail wanted to jump up in pain, but he was pulled to the ground by that thing and could not break free at all\!

"Roar—"

He was shocked, afraid, anxious, and in pain\!

Fresh blood flowed out and the bones of the two front legs were almost broken by the hard and sharp object\!

He struggled with all his might, but could not break free. It would only be more painful and unbearable\!

He was terrified\!

"Roar\!"

"Mom\! Brother\! Help…"

In the distance.

The few black and thin upright animals seemed to have discovered him. They immediately raised the things in their hands and roared as they walked over.

On the other side of the hill.

Chu Xiaoye followed Little Curly Tail's scent and looked for him.

He only wanted to let this brat understand that the food now was not easy to come by and was extremely precious. He could not waste it.

Many animals had starved to death. They had only gone hungry for a few meals, and they could last another day.

Furthermore, there was not much food. Maya also gave birth to two young cubs. It was still unknown if they could survive this dry season.

Therefore, he had to save it until he ate it.

He originally thought that this kid would throw a tantrum and go to the bushes at the back to get angry for a while before returning. Unexpectedly, this kid actually ran far away.

What a stubborn temper\!

Chu Xiaoye decided that when he found him, he would definitely teach him a good lesson and make him obedient in the future and not dare to run around like this again.

"Roar—"

Suddenly, he heard Little Curly Tail's roar coming from the hill\!

His roar was filled with anger and fear\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly increased his speed and ran up the hill\!

At the foot of the hill.

Little Curly Tail was crawling on the ground, baring his fangs and roaring fiercely.

Beside him were four humans in red\!

They were four tall and thin black people. They were holding whips, bows, and knives\!

A black man was pointing his whip at Little Curly Tail and roaring angrily.

As for the other black man, he raised the knife in his hand and aimed it at Little Curly Tail's neck\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and rushed down\!

His gaze was terrified and determined, like a cannonball that had been fired\!

There were sabers, bows, and even other weapons with greater lethality\!

He knew how terrifying humans were\!

If he went, he might very well die with Little Curly Tail in the hands of these humans\!

However, he did not hesitate\!

His animal's instinct to avoid danger also turned into nothingness at this moment\!

He only knew that he could not watch helplessly as Little Curly Tail was killed\!

He could not do it\!

He really could not do it\!

"Roar—"

His roar shook the grassland\!

His aura was fearless of death\!

Little Curly Tail turned around, bared his fangs, and looked at him in a daze, his entire body trembling.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Several sharp arrows flew out from the hands of the few humans\!

The sun was dazzling in the sky above the grassland.

"Whoosh\!"

He jumped up\!
