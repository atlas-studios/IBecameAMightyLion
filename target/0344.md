Chapter 344: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail rushed up.

He swung his tail and instantly wrapped it around the water buffalo leader's neck. Then, he twisted his body and sent the nearly 1,000-kilogram water buffalo flying.

"Bang\!"

The water buffalo leader fell heavily to the ground, his neck broken on the spot. He lay on the ground and wailed endlessly.

The other water buffaloes were shocked when they saw this scene.

Just as they were in a daze, mixed fur, blue eyes, the Jerry brothers, the Chino brothers, Tilly, Catherine, and Mei Mei all rushed up and killed them.

In the blink of an eye, another five water buffaloes fell to the ground.

The remaining water buffaloes were terrified and terrified. They did not dare to stay any longer and fled with their tails wagging.

As for the few huge rhinoceroses, they had long realized that the situation was bad and fled in advance.

The other animals by the river, be it the herbivores or the carnivores, fled in fear.

The crocodiles in the river also disappeared.

When lions killed animals, they would usually only eat after the other party completely stopped breathing. They would not be like hyenas who ate while listening to the miserable cries of their prey.

The six water buffaloes quickly stopped breathing.

Chu Xiaoye took the lead and walked in front of the water buffalo leader, starting to eat.

The cold father twitched his mouth and was very dissatisfied, but he did not dare to say anything.

Although the pride was called the pride of the cold father, everyone knew that the true leader of this pride was not his cold father, and no one would give him face.

At this moment, the cold father missed those times when he was with those old lions.

However, although he missed it, he could not abandon everything like Lars and stay there to continue hanging out with those fellows.

When Chu Xiaoye was about to leave with the pride of the cold father, he had asked Lars about it. However, Lars was determined to stay and continue living on the grassland.

Chu Xiaoye understood him very well.

This strong brother had finally enjoyed the taste of being a leader. He was definitely unwilling to leave.

Here, Lars had many familiar companions and former subordinates. Furthermore, his strength was not weak now and he could be king of a pride at will.

If he followed the pride of the cold father, he would always be an ordinary member under the suppression of the Chu Xiaoye brothers.

Therefore, he chose to stay.

No one would find his decision regretful.

Chu Xiaoye naturally would not force him.

If a lion lived its life without doing anything, eating and waiting for death, and lived under the halo and protection of another lion forever, it would be inferior to a wild dog.

When the pride started to eat, the golden-haired little girl stood in a daze at the side, not knowing what to do.

She was very hungry and her stomach was already rumbling with hunger.

However, looking at the bloody and cruel scene in front of her, she had no appetite and even wanted to vomit.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her and sighed. When he first became a lion, he was like this too. In the end, he was still defeated by hunger.

However, he had the body of a lion and his physique was different from that of this human girl.

No one could guarantee that this little girl would be able to withstand eating these things.

Therefore, he would not force her.

If she wanted to live, she had to compromise with life. No one could help her.

Even Pit and Brother Flat Top ate the intestines with relish. Did you see that?

If she wanted to integrate into this pride, not only did she have to compromise, she also had to adapt. If she could not adapt, she could only wait to be eliminated and abandoned.

Chu Xiaoye was lowering his head to eat the fresh steak and enjoying it when the little girl suddenly walked over and stood beside him. She swallowed her saliva and looked extremely hungry.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at her and saw her suddenly take out a snow-white knife from her waist. She looked at him pitifully and said weakly in English.

What she probably meant was: "Can I eat it?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He did not expect this seemingly weak and delicate little girl to compromise so quickly.

He nodded, indicating that she could.

"Eat whatever you want."

The little girl walked forward and used a knife to cut a piece of fresh beef off the cow's ribs. Her little hand was trembling, but she looked very proficient.

It seemed that this little girl often ate steak.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the sharp knife in her hand and then at her waist. At her waist was a snow-white handle that perfectly merged with the patterns on her white dress. It was almost impossible to see.

The little girl brought the bleeding beef to her mouth shakily, but she was still a little hesitant. However, she only hesitated for about ten seconds before she immediately closed her eyes and bit it.

Blood flowed out and covered the corner of her mouth.

The little girl frowned and looked like she was in pain and fright, but she did not spit it out. She used her teeth to bite down and casually chewed in her mouth a few times. Then, she stretched her neck and swallowed it with difficulty.

Then, she opened her blue eyes and looked at the fresh steak in her hand. Her brows relaxed immediately. She blinked her bright big eyes and smiled sweetly at Chu Xiaoye, saying something in English.

"It's 0% cooked\!"

After saying that, she started to frown and bite again. Her snow-white and exquisite face became extremely painful again.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in shock. This little girl's adaptability and optimistic attitude towards life really impressed him and he found it unbelievable.

Was this really a seven or eight-year-old girl?

The little girl quickly swallowed the piece of beef. Although she was still very hungry, she restrained herself from eating again. Instead, she lowered her head politely at Chu Xiaoye.

"Thank you for your hospitality."

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He looked at her deeply and ignored her. He continued to lower his head and eat.

After the little girl wiped the knife on the grass, she inserted it into the sheath of the knife. Then, she sat on the ground and leaned against Chu Xiaoye. As she looked at the golden setting sun in the river, she used her small hands to arrange her messy golden hair.

After Chu Xiaoye ate his fill, he realized that the little girl had already braided her loose golden hair into two golden braids that hung in front of her chest, making her look even more adorable and beautiful.

In the wild, her loose hair was definitely a burden.

Chu Xiaoye found it unbelievable that this little girl could think of this.

Although the members of this team ate a lot, they could not finish eating six water buffaloes.

The sun soon set.

When the sky turned dark, Chu Xiaoye brought the team up the hill and found a patch of bushes to rest for the time being.

He climbed up the tree to rest, and the little girl leaned against the tree and quickly fell asleep.

The night was quiet and the moonlight was like water.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree, not feeling sleepy at all.

What was happening in the human world now?
