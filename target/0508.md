Chapter 508: No\! Your Majesty\! I Don't Dare\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye was practicing his sword skills in the canyon, and Queen Lanisi was personally guiding him.

The night gradually retreated.

The orcs on the other side of the cliff were still excited.

Chu Xiaoye waved the broken soul in his hand, as if he had already forgotten the time or how he was once a lion that was on all fours. His movements became more and more agile and his movements became more and more proficient.

Finally, the sun peeked out from the eastern sky.

A ray of sunlight shone down.

Chu Xiaoye's sword did not stop.

Lanisi looked up at the sun and then at him with surprise.

Then, this surprise grew stronger.

Annie, who was standing not far away, gradually widened her eyes.

It was dawn, but he was still an elf.

Could it be that he could control his transformation as he pleased so quickly?

Chu Xiaoye finally stopped.

The moment he looked up and saw the sun, he suddenly woke up.

He opened his mouth, not knowing what to say. He suddenly let out a lion roar.

When this lion roar was released, his body suddenly turned blurry. Then, he returned to his original lion appearance.

His clothes fell to the ground completely and the sword in his hand fell.

Chu Xiaoye stood there in a daze.

Queen Lanisi was stunned for a moment before she said carefully, "Night, try to concentrate and pray to your soul to become an elf."

"Pray to my soul?"

Chu Xiaoye would not do these things.

He only closed his eyes and concentrated, telling himself that he wanted to become an elf.

Hence, he suddenly stood up and instantly turned into an exquisite youth with silver hair and ears.

Lanisi said in surprise, "Ye, you can do it\!"

Annie also ran over excitedly. "Yesterday, Vilis said that your uncontrollable state will last for at least a few months, or even a year."

Chu Xiaoye had no time to talk nonsense with them.

He had become an elf and was completely naked like a lion.

He hurriedly picked up the clothes from the ground and put them on in a hurry. He even fell at the Queen's feet with a bang.

Lanisi did not seem to care at all. She smiled and helped him up, even personally helping him pull up his pants.

Chu Xiaoye blushed.

Lanisi picked up the sword on the ground and handed it to him. She said seriously, "Night, I'll rely on you this time. If we can win this Home Protection War, I'll try my best to satisfy you no matter what you request."

Chu Xiaoye took the sword and said, "I only want freedom."

Lanisi's eyes were bright as she said, "I can swear on the reputation of the elven queen and I, Lanisi, that you will always be free here, Night."

Chu Xiaoye inserted Broken Soul into the sheath and raised his hand to point at the torch that was still burning at the entrance of the valley. "How much kerosene is left?"

Lanisi looked at it and was puzzled. However, she seemed to know everything about the Elf Kingdom like the back of her hand.

She pondered for a moment and said, "There's a black mountain behind the city and a black pool in the cave. The pool is not water and is filled with this kind of kerosene. From the moment I was born, the black pool there has always been full. No matter how I take it, I can't finish it."

Chu Xiaoye understood that there should be an oil mine hiding at the foot of the mountain.

To the pure and clean elves, it was dark and especially smelly. It had probably become a useless mountain long ago. Few people stepped foot in it usually, and it was useless to them, except to light the occasional torch.

However, now, that abandoned mountain might save their city and the entire elves.

Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "Your Majesty, inform your subordinates to immediately bring the wooden barrels to Dark Night Mountain to get the kerosene. Every wooden barrel has to be filled with kerosene. The more the better."

This time, Lanisi really did not understand.

She frowned and said, "Night, do you want a torch? There's some tung oil stored in the city. It's completely enough."

It was a critical moment. No one wanted to waste time in the abandoned mountain range. Clean elves hated that place, even at the Queen's orders.

Because no one would understand.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her with flickering eyes. For some reason, he suddenly did not dare to tell her the truth, afraid that the truth would be too cruel and make this elf girl, who was only 17 years old, unable to accept it.

Even he felt that it was cruel.

However, if they did not win this war, not only would the elves die, he and Catherine would also be doomed.

Therefore, he had to throw himself into the cold-blooded and cruel state of war. He could not show any mercy or mercy.

"Your Majesty, I'm your counselor. You have to believe me."

Chu Xiaoye did not explain, but he said firmly.

Lanisi no longer hesitated and immediately turned around. She instructed the four female elf captains to immediately bring all the palace guards and wooden barrels to the back mountain to gather fire oil.

"The more the better\!"

The Queen instructed.

Although the four female captains were a little hesitant, they did not hesitate and immediately took action.

Looking at their hurriedly leaving backs and Chu Xiaoye's suddenly cold gaze, the Queen guessed in her heart, Perhaps he wants to light more torches and fill the entire valley. This way, he can confuse the enemy. The enemy might mistake us for having many people in the fairy race. They might be afraid and suddenly retreat.

At the thought of this, the Queen could not help but admire the young elf in front of her again.

"Night, you're so smart. Thank you."

Lanisi said sincerely, her face filled with gratitude and relief.

She had picked up a treasure.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in a daze and said, "Your Majesty knows what I want to do?"

A little pleased with herself appeared on Lanisi's face. She smiled and said, "Of course, your queen is not a fool."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but sigh secretly. He had still underestimated the intelligence of this Elven Queen.

However, from the looks of it, she should be able to accept it.

This battle concerned the survival of the entire elven race and the survival and destruction of this city. As the queen of the elves, she naturally had to do everything she could.

"It's good that Your Majesty agrees."

Chu Xiaoye relaxed and looked up at the hills on both sides of the canyon.

There were huge rocks piled on it. It was a good place to hide and ambush.

As long as the orc army entered this canyon, if nothing went wrong, they would never go out again.

"Your Majesty."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the Elven Queen and said, "Can your pterodactyl fly over and spit fire?"

Lanisi immediately shook her head and said, "No, we can't let Dolma come down. Although it can spit fire and has hard scales on its body, it's also made of flesh. Strong orcs will kill it with bows and spears."

Chu Xiaoye naturally understood because Catherine had already killed one.

"Your Majesty, I'm not asking it to spit fire at the orcs. I'm saying, if there are no orcs, can it rush down and destroy the bridge built by the orcs with flames?"

Chu Xiaoye initially thought of using a few elven soldiers to destroy the bridge, but he also thought that the bridge built by the orcs would definitely be very strong and be very slow to destroy. At that time, the bridge would probably not be destroyed and the few elven soldiers would die tragically. Then, all his previous efforts would be wasted. 

However, if the pterodactyl spat out flames to destroy it, it would be much faster and much safer.

Lanisi did not understand and said, "Of course, but why should we destroy the bridge? If we win, the bridge can be saved for us to use. If I lose, it will be even more meaningless."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the elven guards around him and did not answer immediately. He said, "Your Majesty, you only have to listen to me. Our Elven Kingdom will win this war\!"

Lanisi's eyes were bright and she could not hide the joy and excitement in her heart. She held his hand and said, "Night, I believe you. I'll do whatever you say. As long as we can protect our Elf City and our fairy fire seed, I'm willing to give up everything."

"Cough\! Cough, cough\!"

Right at this moment, an unhappy cough suddenly came from behind.

Vilis returned.

On the shoulder of this huge sword loli, she returned with a brand new sword. Furthermore, she had changed her clothes again. She was no longer wearing silver armor, but silver skin-tight leather clothes, leather pants, and a silver short skirt.

With her combat skills, she was indeed not suited to wearing heavy armor in large battles.

She was most skilled in speed and strength. This attire would make the huge sword in her hand faster and more fierce, and her movements would be more agile and flexible.

"Baldy, take your dirty hands away\!"

The huge sword loli shouted coldly.

Chu Xiaoye broke free of the Queen's hand and touched his silver hair. "Where are your eyes? Which eye saw that I was bald?"

The huge sword loli walked over and deliberately stood beside him. She was half a head taller than him and said coldly, "Shorty."

This time, Chu Xiaoye had nothing to refute.

He looked at the huge sword on the elf's shoulder and could not help but praise, "Very beautiful\! How did you forge it in such a short time?"

"Clangâ€”"

Vilis pulled out her sword and stuck it in the ground in front of her. She raised her chin and could not hide her pride. "It's made of steel and enhanced with blood essence\! Shorty, how about another competition?"

Chu Xiaoye took the initiative to admit defeat. "There's no need to fight. I admit defeat."

"Heh."

The huge sword loli was not happy. She looked at him sideways and said, "Shouldn't you be braver after becoming an elf?"

Chu Xiaoye smiled and said, "My courage is not used to deal with my own people."

Vilis snorted and turned her face away. "Come on, we're not family."

With that said, he turned his head and said, "However, we will be one family soon. Because soon, you will become my mount. At that time, Lady Vilis will definitely not show mercy on your crotch\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to bicker with her and asked, "How's the preparation of Denise's crossbow?"

Vilis did not answer and looked at the Queen. "Your Majesty, when I just came, I saw Loli and the others bringing people and wooden buckets to the Night Mountain at the back. Which idiot wants to light more torches at this time to shine brighter, balder, shorter, and more wretched?"

He was clearly implying something.

Lanisi smiled and said, "I decided."

Vilis looked askance at a certain fellow beside her and said, "But this rotten idea was definitely not suggested by Your Majesty. You don't have to guess. It was a certain fellow."

Chu Xiaoye sighed and had no choice but to stand up to provoke her. "Lady Vilis, we had a bet previously that we could kill 300 orcs with my method. Now, should we make another bet? Let's bet that with my plan, we can defeat the orc army on the other side of the cliff and let our elves win this war completely."

Hearing this bet, the Queen's eyes lit up.

If possible, she was willing to make this bet, only betting that he could win.

When Vilis heard this bet, she was clearly stunned for a moment. After a moment of silence, she shook her head and said, "I won't bet."

Of course she would not bet.

Even if she thought that they would lose and the entire elf race would be destroyed by the orc army, she was unwilling to admit it, let alone use it as a bet.

"I hope that you're right and that you win."

The huge sword loli whispered, no longer having the arrogance and interest she had just now.

Queen Lanisi quietly nudged Chu Xiaoye with her arm and smiled at Vilis. "Of course, we all hope that Night can win. Vilis, if Night really helps us and wins this war, how should we reward him?"

Vilis raised her head and looked at the young elf in front of her with flickering eyes. She slowly said, "Your Majesty, you decide."

Lanisi smiled and said, "What I decide doesn't count. I want Night to speak personally about what he needs."

"Night, what do you need the most now?"

The Queen touched his arm and secretly raised her eyebrows at him. She blinked and a young girl's playful smile rippled on her face.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly took a step back and said nervously, "Your Majesty, I don't want a woman. I'm a lion. Even if I become an elf now, I have a lion heart. I can't accept marrying a female elf for the time being, let aloneâ€¦"

He looked at the huge sword loli at the side and said in disdain, "She's short and has a bad temper."

Vilis was stunned and confused at first, but then she stomped her feet in embarrassment and anger. "Baldy\! Dream on\!"

Lanisi's mouth was slightly open and she also had a stunned expression.

What she meant was that she wanted him to make a request for a sword attendant. How could he understand that she wanted to marry an elf to him? Furthermore, why did he want to marry Vilis?

"Night, that's not what I meantâ€¦ Your sword."

The Queen could only remind him more clearly.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and looked down at the sword in his hand. This steel sword was given to him by the Queen.

Thinking of how the Queen suddenly held his hand and quietly touched his arm just now, winking at him like a girl who was having an affair, Chu Xiaoye was shocked.

"No\! Your Majesty\! No\! I don't dare\!"

He took a few steps back and cried out involuntarily, but he sighed inwardly. Damn it\! Even if I become an elf, it will still be difficult to change my handsome and charming kingly aura.
