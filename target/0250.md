Chapter 250: Fight to the Death\!

At the edge of the bushes.

That was once the territory of the Seno brothers' pride.

However, ever since the Seno brothers' pride was killed, this territory had become ownerless.

A month ago.

A pair of male brothers brought seven female lions and migrated here to occupy this territory.

However, before this, the bushes that had once split into two were all taken by the pride of the cold father.

The entire forest became the territory of the pride of the cold father.

The cold father left his scent outside the bushes again and marked the new border.

The new Nuka lions also tacitly agreed to this border.

In the beginning, the Nuka brothers looked down on the cold father's pride when they saw that there was only one adult lion. They also coveted his pride and territory.

One day, they deliberately crossed the border with great fanfare, wanting to test the cold father's courage and strength before making plans.

In the end, just as they walked over, before they could see the cold father, they were slapped unconscious by Little Curly Tail, who was mimicking his brother in digging pits and pooping\!

Then, Little Curly Tail called for Mei Mei. The siblings brought the lion brothers to a big tree at the border and hung them on a high branch, swaying with the wind.

When the Nuka brothers woke up, they immediately peed their pants in fear. Their bodies were limp and their souls flew out. They cried out endlessly on the tree.

As for their female lions, they were standing at the border and looking up at them, not daring to take a step closer.

From then on, the two brothers no longer dared to approach this forest and were extremely friendly to the pride of the cold father.

Sometimes, when the two brothers encountered the cold father while patrolling the border, they would even put the unfinished prey at the border and give it to the cold father as a gift.

The cold father naturally did not stand on ceremony. As he accepted the gifts, he proudly comforted them that they did not have to be afraid, indicating that he was not interested in their pride and territory.

When the Nukas heard him say this, they naturally relaxed. They thanked him profusely and respected him even more.

As for the other prides that bordered the territory of the cold father's pride, or the prides that did not come from afar, most of them had been beaten up by the warlike Little Curly Tail.

Therefore, the cold father lived a very relaxed life.

He only called out a few times at night to warn the wandering lions nearby.

If not for Little Curly Tail threatening to beat him up, he would not even be bothered to pee at the border.

At this moment.

Hearing Mei Mei's angry roar outside the bushes, the cold father thought that the Nuka brothers had provoked his daughter. He immediately brought the pride and rushed over aggressively.

They were relatively close.

When they arrived, Little Curly Tail ran over at lightning speed.

Mei Mei was standing at the border, baring her fangs and roaring at a lion a few meters in front of her, as if she was warning her.

The lion was strong and had a lush mane, but it was not a member of the Nuka lions.

At this moment, he stood there facing the territory of the pride of the cold father and looked at Mei Mei with a burning gaze, as if he was extremely interested in Mei Mei.

When he saw Little Curly Tail and the cold father running over, the lion still did not leave.

He ignored Little Curly Tail, who had a thin mane, and looked at the cold father with a thick mane, his eyes filled with provocation.

"Roar—"

Seeing that he, a lone lion, was actually so arrogant, the cold father immediately roared angrily and prepared to pounce on him to teach this fellow who did not know the immensity of heaven and earth a lesson.

Little Curly Tail suddenly stopped in front of him and looked solemnly at the territory of the Nuka lions.

The air was filled with a strong smell of blood.

This lion stood brazenly in the territory of the Nuka lions, but the Nuka brothers did not come out to chase them away. The situation was very wrong.

Furthermore, Little Curly Tail suddenly felt that the lion in front of him was a little familiar.

It seemed…

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the terrified roars of the Nuka brothers suddenly came from the distant darkness.

Then, the manes of the two brothers fluttered as they ran over from afar in a hurry, as if they were being chased by something terrifying.

Behind them were four female lions, also terrified.

Soon, Little Curly Tail saw what was behind.

His heart trembled as if he was facing a great enemy\!

They were five strong adult lions with dark manes\!

He finally knew why the lion in front of him was a little familiar\!

It turned out that these few lions were actually members of the recently famous and ferocious Mafia Alliance\!

He had seen it from afar once.

"Roar—"

The five lions were very fast. They pounced on the four female lions and pushed them to the ground. Then, they bit their throats mercilessly\!

The four female lions were pressed to the ground and could not move or resist.

The Nuka brothers did not stop, nor did they dare to return to save him. They still ran for their lives and ran over.

Normally, when lions snatched territory, they would not hurt female lions.

At most, he would defeat them. After all, they would still need to hunt and produce offspring in the future.

But now, these five lions did not hesitate and bit the necks of the four female lions, wanting to kill them\!

One of the lions continued to chase after the Nuka brothers after biting the abdomen of a female lion.

The lion standing at the border was the youngest brother in the Mafia Alliance. At this moment, he immediately ran over and prepared to block the escape route of the Nuka brothers.

The cold father was terrified when he saw this scene, but he had no choice but to continue to stand at the border and guard his territory and pride.

Little Curly Tail observed carefully and saw that only six lions had mobilized in this Mafia alliance. There was also one that went missing.

No one knew if he died from injuries or if he was hiding elsewhere.

The young lion that had just provoked them pounced at the Nuka brothers ferociously and quickly.

The lion chasing behind was also preparing to pounce.

However, the Nuka brothers did not have any fighting spirit. They could not care less about facing the enemy and only wanted to escape. They rushed towards the territory of the pride of the cold father with all their might\!

The two brothers ran side by side and actually knocked away the young lion that was charging at them. They ran forward in panic and actually crossed the border and ran into the territory of the pride of the cold father. They stood beside the cold father and looked at him in fear and begging.

The cold father froze in place and suddenly roared angrily. He widened his eyes in anger and told them to scram\!

Was he trying to burn his neighbors?

The Nuka brothers immediately lay on the ground, lowered their heads, and growled to show their submission.

They could not run anymore.

Their female lions and young cubs had already been killed.

They did not want to die.

"Roar —"

The cold father continued to roar angrily and even raised his claws to slap them, wanting to chase away the two bastards who had attracted trouble.

However, the Nuka brothers lay on the ground and let him slap them. They refused to get up, as if they were already clinging to him.

At this moment, the cold father felt deep regret.

He regretted accepting their gifts back then. He regretted bragging about how powerful he was back then. He even bragged that he could slap this younger son of his until he shat his pants\!

Now, he had suffered the consequences of his own actions and was about to shit from fear.

The other party had a total of six adult lions\!

Furthermore, they all looked extremely ferocious. They seemed to be enjoying the slaughter. They did not look like they were fighting for territory or female lions.

The cold father regretted it\!

He swore that in the future, he would definitely keep a low profile and never brag again.

The necks of the four female lions were bitten off and they died on the spot.

One of the lions actually deliberately cut open the stomach of a pregnant lioness in front of the pride of the cold father and dug out the cubs inside to eat with relish.

"Whoosh\!"

Mei Mei's entire body trembled as she revealed her sharp claws.

Those claws were actually suffused with a faint blue light and were actually the same color as her eyes\!

Her eyes spewed flames and she was extremely furious\!

Seeing her reaction, the youngest lion actually dug out the intestines of a female lion and brought them over, placing them at the border. He looked at her with a burning gaze, as if he was treating these intestines as a gift.

The other five lions walked over side by side.

Although they did not roar or show their sharp teeth, their ferocious and powerful aura made every member of the pride of the cold father feel terrified.

Little Curly Tail looked back at his mother, at Callie, Maya, and Mei Mei and Xi'er beside him. His chest burned with a hot flame\!

He took a step forward and stood at the border. He swung his claws and sent the intestines on the ground flying. Then, he raised his head and his bright eyes collided with the young lion's gaze.

He blocked the border and in front of these six ferocious lions, not backing down at all\!

Mei Mei walked to his side and stood beside him.

The fear in the cold father's heart suddenly turned into strength at this moment.

Protecting his home and family was his responsibility as a king, as a father and husband\!

He would never let his son and daughter be looked down upon by his pride\!

Although he was afraid of death, he was not weak\!

He strode forward with the dignity a lion king should have and stood beside his son and daughter.

Xi'er, who was blind in one eye, stood beside him resolutely.

Callie and Maya, who were trembling under the ferocious aura of the six lions, immediately walked over and stood with her bravely.

Aisha walked to the other side and stood beside her son. She looked lovingly at Little Curly Tail, then looked ahead.

Maya turned around and looked at the bushes.

She could not see her two children, but she knew that her two children were hiding in the underground cave with the warthog called Pit.

She bared her fangs, and the motherly love in her eyes suddenly turned into ferocity as she prepared to risk her life.

The six lions of the Mafia Alliance walked over like a group of bloodthirsty butchers, emitting a strong smell of blood and killing intent.

As for the members of the pride of the cold father, they stood side by side and stood at the border with unity. They shared a common enemy and would not retreat\!

This border was their lifeline.

For their home and family, no one could think of crossing it\!

They would fight whoever dared to invade to the death\!
