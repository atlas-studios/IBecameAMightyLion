Chapter 183: The Savage and Terrifying Little Lioness\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flickered and blood splashed\!

Under the pale moonlight, the corpses of hyenas were all over the ground.

After a moment.

The twenty-plus spotted hyenas lay on the ground and could not get up.

Some were still crying out miserably, and some had already died on the spot\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, he was not much better.

His entire body was covered in wounds bitten by the hyenas. He was covered in blood and could not jump anymore.

As for the remaining hyena army, they were still fearless of death and pounced at him crazily. Even if their heads were crushed by his claw, they took the opportunity to pounce on him, block his claws, and let their companions attack better behind them\!

At this moment, the hyena army was like trained deathsworn. They advanced one after another, using their corpses to block his steps and claws and using their lives to fight for a chance for their companions to bite him\!

Chu Xiaoye's limbs were badly mutilated from the biting. Be it his speed or reaction speed, they were much slower.

He could not jump or run. He could only swing his claws in place and use his sharp golden claws to stop the ferocious attacks of the hyenas\!

His strength was quickly exhausted and his waving claws became heavier.

The Chino brothers stood up with him and let out desperate roars, protecting his back with all their might.

However, most hyenas ignored the two brothers and placed almost all their focus on Chu Xiaoye.

They knew that as long as this young lion king fell, everything would end\!

At this moment.

The hyena queen finally walked over.

The hyena army outside immediately made way.

The hyena queen's gaze ignored the Chino brothers who were roaring hoarsely. Instead, she looked coldly at the young lion king covered in blood but still fighting, and his golden claws that were as sharp as blades.

Her eyes revealed human-like jealousy, desire, and jealousy.

She decided to kill him personally\!

Chu Xiaoye watched from the corner of his eye as the hyena queen walked over. A cold glint flashed in the depths of his eyes.

He swung his claws slower again and staggered, almost losing his balance.

Two more hyenas pounced forward and bit his neck and head ferociously\!

Chu Xiaoye swung his right claw and tore their entire lower jaws\!

The two spotted hyenas immediately fell to the ground, vomiting blood and letting out miserable cries.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he finally could not stand steadily and fell to the ground.

He immediately struggled to get up again, but his limbs were limp and he swayed, looking like he was about to fall again.

"Whoosh—"

The hyena queen suddenly jumped and pounced forward\!

Its raised claws flickered with a cold light under the moonlight\!

Her gaze was cold and fierce\!

Just as she was about to pounce in front of Chu Xiaoye, Chu Xiaoye, who was about to fall, actually jumped up from the ground with a whoosh\!

This jump happened to dodge her pounce and he landed on her head\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and his sharp claws attacked\!

His movements were still as fast as lightning\!

The sharp golden claw instantly pierced through the hyena queen's head and slashed at her back\!

The hyena queen was scared out of her wits. She used some strength and suddenly turned around in midair, landing heavily on the ground with a bang\!

From then on, she escaped the danger of the golden claw breaking her spine\!

As soon as she landed, she agilely rolled out, jumped up, and landed among the hyena pack.

Blood flowed down her face and the wound on her head extended to her neck. If she had not suddenly erupted with strength and turned around to escape the golden claw, her spine would have broken and she would have fallen to the ground\!

She trembled at the thought of the danger just now.

Thinking of how cunning this young lion king was, she was even more furious\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and still stood there steadily. His golden claws were covered in blood as he looked at her coldly, feeling that it was a pity.

He had indeed been pretending previously because he wanted the hyena queen to kill him personally so that he could suddenly counterattack and kill her with one blow\!

Unfortunately, the other party's reaction speed was too fast and he failed\!

He was indeed seriously injured and his stamina was about to be exhausted. Since this attack had failed, he would probably have to face the hyena queen's craziest revenge and attack next\!

The grass around them was filled with the corpses of hyenas.

However, there were still forty to fifty hyenas surrounding them.

His limbs were injured and there were no trees around him. He had nowhere to run.

The ferocity of these hyenas that were not afraid of death did not look like a group of animals at all. Instead, they looked like a team that followed orders like steel.

They used their blood and corpses to create opportunities for their companions.

No matter how powerful he was, how could he be a match for this group of fearless steel troops?

The hyena queen raised her claws and wiped the blood on her face. Her gaze at him was filled with hatred.

"Ahhh —"

She stood in the hyena pack and let out a sharp order.

The hyena army started moving again\!

Looking at the still dense hyena army around him pouncing on him, Chu Xiaoye knew that his life as a lion that had just begun and was about to end.

Although he had become the youngest king and obtained a very fertile territory, this was not what he really wanted.

He raised his head and looked at the distant Dark Range, his gaze becoming gentle.

On the other side of the mountain, were they okay?

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly came from the distant grassland\!

Then, a figure streaked across the dark grassland like lightning and shot over\!

They arrived in the blink of an eye\!

"Bang\!"

She was like a cannonball that had been fired and charged bravely forward into the hyena army. She used her rapid speed and terrifying strength to crash into the hyena army unstoppably\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The spotted hyenas in front of her flew out\!

Some had their heads broken, some had their ribs broken, and some had their internal organs broken. They fainted on the spot\!

She instantly opened a path and came to Chu Xiaoye's side. She suddenly jumped and pounced at the hyena queen hiding in the hyena pack\!

She recognized the hyena leader at a glance\!

The hyena queen was shocked. She hurriedly turned around and fled, roaring an urgent order\!

She was already injured and her movements became slow.

The hyenas surrounding her immediately opened their mouths and prepared to bite\!

However, the figure that was as fast as lightning did not land on the ground. Instead, it stepped on the head of a spotted hyena and jumped up again. With a whoosh, it suddenly pounced on the running hyena queen and pushed her to the ground, biting her neck\!

The hyena queen widened her eyes and twisted her body violently to struggle, but her neck was bitten off by the figure with a crack and her abdomen was broken with a claw\!

Blood and internal organs immediately splashed out\!

This pursuit and kill happened in the blink of an eye\!

Before the hyenas could react, their powerful queen's throat was bitten off and her stomach was cut open. She died instantly\!

The hyena queen opened her mouth, her eyes wide with fear and unwillingness, as if she could not believe it.

The hyena army instantly stopped in place and was dead silent.

Even the Chino brothers, who were covered in blood, widened their eyes and froze in place, looking dumbfounded at the sudden appearance of this powerful female cub.

Catherine loosened her teeth and slowly raised her head to look at the figure.

Chu Xiaoye was covered in blood and looked at her in a daze.

"Roar—"

The little lioness suddenly let out a terrifying roar. With a whoosh, she rushed towards the hyenas and brandished her claws. Her figure was like lightning as she started killing crazily\!

With the hyena queen dead, the hyena army was like an army that had lost its leader and instantly became a plate of loose sand. They were utterly defeated and fled in panic\!

Their strong team spirit collapsed\!

However, the crazy female cub did not let them go\!

She was like a bloodthirsty devil. Wherever she went, blood would spray and internal organs would fill the ground\!

Almost every fallen hyena had its abdomen cut open and died in fear\!

In a moment, only ten-odd of the remaining forty to fifty spotted hyenas were left\!

However, the female cub still did not intend to let them go\!

They fled in fear, begging and letting out miserable cries. However, before they could escape 100 meters, they were caught up by the female cub that was like the wind and had their abdomens cut open\!

All the hyenas lay on the grass. Some died on the spot, and some still cried out miserably\!

Some even dragged their internal organs and crawled\!

Fear made them forget the pain and despair, and made their already cut bodies subconsciously crawl away from the female cub\!

Not only was the grassland filled with a strong smell of blood, but it was also filled with a terrifying aura.

When the figure covered in the blood of hyenas walked over slowly with the moonlight on her back, the Chino brothers, who were standing beside Chu Xiaoye, peed their pants on the spot\!

Their bodies trembled and their limbs turned limp as they fell to the ground.

Just now, even the terrifying hyena army had not been able to make them lie down. But now, this female cub had swept away their dignity and prestige as lions\!

When the female cub walked close with a strong smell of blood, the Chino brothers lay on the ground and wagged their tails, expressing their submission in fear. They were obedient\!

However, this female cub did not look at them. Instead, she walked in front of their boss, lowered her head, and rubbed his neck gently.

Then, a scene that made their jaws drop happened\!

This female cub stuck out her tongue and started to lick the wounds and blood on their boss's body.

"Bang\!"

Just as she walked to the back, the Chino brothers saw their boss raise his hind leg and kick her in the face\!

The female cub was kicked to the ground\!

However, she immediately got up again, seemingly not angry or annoyed at all. She actually continued to lower her head and respectfully and gently licked the wound on Boss's hind leg\!

That foot had just kicked her\!

The Chino brothers were dumbfounded.
