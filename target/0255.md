Chapter 255: The King Returns\!

"Bang\!"

There was a muffled sound of bones breaking.

The cold father flew out and landed heavily on the ground, blood splashing from his mouth.

He lay on the ground and closed his eyes, but he suddenly opened them again. He raised his head and looked at Little Curly Tail, who had landed in front of him, and at his tail.

One of his fangs flew out and was slapped away by his son's tail.

As for Little Curly Tail's tail, it hung on the ground behind him and could not be curled up again.

Just as the black lion's huge palm was about to slap the cold father's open mouth, Little Curly Tail's tail took a step forward and collided violently with the palm.

Then, the cold father was sent flying by Little Curly Tail's tail and the fangs in his mouth were broken.

Little Curly Tail's tail broke.

"He's indeed an unfilial son\!"

The cold father roared in pain and stood up. He limped back and took a few steps forward, standing in front of his unfilial son. He bared his remaining fangs and looked at the black lion king in front of him.

Was this unfilial son going to snatch the limelight from him?

He was the king of this pride\!

Little Curly Tail was protected behind him. His broken tail was trembling slightly and the intense pain made him almost unable to stand steadily.

"Roar—"

The cold father suddenly roared angrily and rushed up again.

"Bang\!"

A figure suddenly rushed out from behind him and knocked him to the ground. Then, with a flash of light, a light blue claw grabbed at the black lion with a whoosh\!

Sed's pupils constricted. He did not take the attack head-on and suddenly retreated to avoid it.

When the figure grabbed an empty spot and landed on the ground, he suddenly took another step forward and suddenly slapped it.

His entire retreat was completed in the blink of an eye. It was indescribably fast\!

"Bang\!"

Mei Mei landed on the ground and was sent flying by a slap. She landed heavily beside the cold father and blacked out on the spot.

The cold father got up from the ground and stood in front of her. He continued to bare his fangs and let out an angry and loud roar.

Xi'er walked up and stood beside him. Her only eye that was dyed red with blood was still emitting a fierce light.

Callie walked over with a terrifying wound on her head.

Maya walked over and swayed.

Aisha, who had woken up from her coma, struggled to stand up and walked over. However, she fell to the ground again and fell beside the cold father.

Little Curly Tail also walked over, dragging his broken tail and enduring the pain.

The entire family stood here and stood beside the cold father.

The cold father turned around and looked at them. The emotions that had suddenly appeared in his heart at some point in time suddenly made his eyes burn and he could not control himself.

They were family, companions of life and death, relatives who had gone through thick and thin together. From the rainy season to the dry season, and then from the dry season to the rainy season, no matter how difficult it was, they had never been apart.

Now, they would die here and be buried in a beautiful grassland for their home, their responsibility, and theirs.

Perhaps they were afraid, but they did not hesitate\!

The cold father stood at the front and raised his head, as if he had once led them to defeat the invaders. He let out the roar of a lion that resounded throughout the entire territory\!

The female lions, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei, who was gradually waking up from her coma, raised their heads and roared.

The pride of the cold father would never surrender\!

The tragic roar of life and death almost spread throughout the entire territory and the entire night sky\!

Little Nuka, who was standing at the back, was stunned for a moment. She suddenly heard some movement in the distant darkness.

A terrifying aura that made his entire body tremble and even his soul tremble assaulted him with the night wind that smelled of blood\!

He suddenly raised his head and looked over.

A pair of dark eyes suddenly appeared in the darkness.

Then, more eyes appeared\!

Sed, who was about to roar and attack, and the eight lions baring their fangs and preparing to sprint behind him, instinctively restrained their killing intent and turned around to look at the darkness.

The darkness was not too dark.

A young lion ran over from the distant darkness with a group of terrifyingly huge lions, like a demon king that had crawled out of hell or a ferocious beast that had survived from the ancient times\!

A terrifying aura crushed out\!

Sed, who had killed almost everyone in the grassland and was known as the Killing God, suddenly trembled and almost fell to the ground.

His huge body, which was nearly 500 kilograms, actually seemed so weak and pitiful at this moment.

Those six terrifying giant lions were each larger and more ferocious than the other. They almost crushed him, a killing god, to the point that there was nothing left\!

They were very fast and almost seemed to be flying\!

They arrived in the blink of an eye\!

Their appearances became clear.

Every member of the pride of the cold father stood there in a daze, not moving.

They looked blankly at the young lion running at the front with a circle of golden fur on its neck. It seemed to want to open its mouth to roar, but was a little hesitant.

Until he ran close and stopped in front of them, looking at them with a familiar and bright gaze.

Mei Mei suddenly got up from the ground with unknown strength. Although her mouth and nose were still dripping with blood and her head was in extreme pain, her consciousness suddenly became exceptionally clear.

She trembled in excitement and her vision started to blur.

Little Curly Tail opened his mouth and also trembled. He was so excited that he could not control himself, but he did not dare to recognize her.

This familiar figure and familiar aura became even taller and stronger. There was even a circle of golden fur on his neck. There were actually so many giant lions following behind him…

Was it his brother?

"Whoosh\!"

A familiar figure suddenly rushed out from behind this figure and pounced at the group of lions behind the black lion at lightning speed\!

The eight lions that had just bared their teeth and roared with a murderous aura were already scared out of their wits. They trembled like sieves and almost could not resist in time. In the blink of an eye, their stomachs were cut open by the silver claws that filled the sky and they fell to the ground\!

Blood sprayed and internal organs were all over the ground.

Terrified and desperate roars instantly rose and fell.

Eight majestic lions lay in a pool of blood with their mouths open and eyes wide, as if they had encountered a terrifying devil. Until death, they did not see each other's appearance.

That terrifying figure was like a ghost in the night. After opening their stomachs, it stood silently behind the black lion.

Those silver claws flickered with a cold light like blades\!

Those dark eyes were as deep and cold as the night\!

Her name was Catherine.

Her nickname was Ripper\!

Of course, she was also called—his shadow\!

Little Curly Tail finally recognized her, but he was a little afraid.

Mei Mei also recognized her, but she stood in place in disbelief.

The cold father naturally recognized her too. However, his stomach subconsciously started to tremble again and his bladder was a little swollen. He wanted to mark the territory.

Chu Xiaoye slowly walked in front of his mother and lowered his head, which was already much taller than hers. He lowered his body and expressed his longing and guilt with the most gentle movements.

Aisha's entire body was trembling and her eyes were moist. Just like when he was young, she used her mother's love to lick his fur and comfort his body.

No matter how tall, strong, mighty, or non-mainstream he was, he was still her son.

Wasn't it?
