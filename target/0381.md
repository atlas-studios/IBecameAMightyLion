Chapter 381: Untitled

The night quickly passed.

However, the stubborn water buffaloes still did not disperse.

After changing shifts, they continued to guard the outside.

They seemed to be determined to use this method to force the pride to leave this territory.

However, they might never have thought that because of them, none of the members of the pride could bear to leave.

The beef was so fragrant\!

When Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others dragged the other two water buffaloes back, a feast of beef and cow blood immediately started in the pride's camp.

Before eating, Chu Xiaoye let Catherine use her sharp claws to cut off the flesh of one of the water buffaloes and throw away a big piece.

Because that piece had been eaten by the lioness with a bloody light in her eyes.

Although he did not know where the lioness came from and why she was so powerful, Chu Xiaoye still could not forget those scarlet eyes.

He did not want to eat a meal and suddenly fall ill.

Everyone ate with relish, their mouths full of blood. As for him, he lay on the ground with no appetite.

Not everyone could understand the pain in the balls.

As for the female lions, they would never understand, other than the hyenas that always liked to attack other people's testicles and the pitiful bugs that had their testicles bitten off.

The little girl was brought down from the tree by Catherine and squatted beside him. She was holding a sharp knife and there were a few banana leaves spread in front of her. She was cutting the thin beef slices seriously.

When she was tired of cutting, she stopped and took out the small egg from her pocket. She handed it to Chu Xiaoye's mouth patiently and said, "Eat the egg."

Chu Xiaoye had already calmed down from his initial anger. He rolled his eyes and ignored her.

This girl must have done it on purpose\! She must have seen something\!

Chu Xiaoye thought so and decided to apply wild chili juice on all her beef jerky when the time came. It would be so spicy that it would kill this smelly girl\!

The sun illuminated the grassland and the entire forest.

The water buffaloes guarding outside immediately recovered their vision. When they saw that this group of lions was actually eating their companions brazenly, they were furious.

They originally thought that by blocking the outside like this, they could starve the lions to death or force the other party away. However, they never would have thought that the other party would actually use them as food.

If they continued to waste time, they would naturally be the ones to suffer in the end.

"Moo—"

The strong water buffalo leader suddenly issued an order to attack.

The water buffaloes that were eating grass immediately ran over when they heard the news and gathered together. They were full of fighting spirit and prepared to take revenge for their companions.

Chu Xiaoye cursed inwardly when he saw this scene. He immediately growled and instructed everyone to hide and prepare to fight.

He tore off the remaining big piece of steak and brought it to the simple hut that had just been built on the Baobab tree. Then, he brought the little girl up and let her continue to cut the beef slices there.

This Baobab tree was extremely thick. Even if the water buffalo used all its strength, it could not do anything to it.

However, the other trees in this forest might suffer.

If this group of giant water buffaloes went crazy, the entire forest would be leveled\!

Just as the battle was about to start, the water buffaloes outside suddenly became chaotic.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and looked up.

In the middle of the water buffaloes, there was a water buffalo that had gone crazy. It started to use the horns on its head crazily to attack its companions around it.

It looked extremely violent and fierce. Its thick horns were as sharp as blades and instantly pierced into the neck of a water buffalo. Then, it pushed the water buffalo to the ground.

The water buffalo did not expect its companion to suddenly attack it. It did not have the time to react at all. After falling to the ground, it struggled with all its might in pain.

After the crazy water buffalo pierced its neck, it did not stop and immediately rushed towards another water buffalo at the side.

The other water buffalo could not escape in time and could only lower its head and block with its horns. However, its head was suddenly broken with a bang and its body tilted and it fell to the ground.

The crazy water buffalo rushed towards its third companion with red eyes\!

For a moment, the neat herd was in chaos. All the water buffaloes started to run in panic, not knowing what was happening.

"Moo—"

The strong water buffalo leader suddenly rushed out of the herd. It lowered its head and hit the back of the crazy water buffalo heavily, sending it flying\!

After the crazy water buffalo landed on the ground, it actually rolled and quickly got up again, as if it was not injured at all. It immediately rushed towards the water buffalo leader with red eyes.

The water buffalo leader stood in place, looking a little shocked. He immediately lowered his head to resist.

"Bang\!"

The heads of the two water buffaloes suddenly collided.

The water buffalo leader immediately staggered. After taking a few steps back, he fell to the ground. Blood flowed from his mouth and nose, and his skull was broken.

As for the crazy water buffalo, it was also knocked back a few steps and fell to the ground. However, it got up again. Its head collapsed and its head was covered in blood, but it was still lively and exceptionally excited. With a roar, it rushed towards the other water buffaloes again.

When the surrounding water buffaloes saw this scene, they did not dare to stay any longer. They hurriedly fled in all directions, terrified.

Even their leader was dead. What was the point of them staying here?

The crazy water buffalo's skull was clearly broken, but its speed was even faster and its movements were even more ferocious. It immediately caught up to a water buffalo and pushed its head against its butt. Its sharp horns pierced in. It raised its head and actually raised the water buffalo's butt high. Then, it fell to the ground with a bang. Blood flowed from its back and it cried out in pain\!

The crazy water buffalo did not stop. Its eyes were red and it was panting heavily. It suddenly lowered its head and its sharp horns pierced into the water buffalo's stomach. It raised its head and actually opened the water buffalo's stomach\!

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and felt his blood run cold.

He had seen those scarlet eyes many times. Although the eyes of the powerful lioness last night were also red, there was only a faint color that was not so terrifying.

This crazy water buffalo had clearly lost its mind long ago and had long forgotten about its companions and itself.

At this moment, there was only blood and killing in its heart\!

Furthermore, its head was already broken and its face was covered in blood, but it was still so strong. Clearly, it was not a true water buffalo anymore but a terrifying "monster"\!

It was very fast and rushed towards another water buffalo again.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped down from the tree and shot towards the crazy water buffalo like an arrow\!

This was his territory. He could not allow this monster to be impudent here\!
