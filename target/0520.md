Chapter 520: The Crisis of the Pride

Love them?

Of course not\!

Chu Xiaoye had no choice but to return. It was not that he could not bear to leave, let alone love them.

"Your Majesty, please repair the bridge quickly."

After returning to the room in the castle, Chu Xiaoye requested.

Lanisi said with a difficult expression, "Night, you know that there are only more than 1,000 elves in our elven race now, and most of them are girls. There are no artisans who build bridges."

Chu Xiaoye was very depressed. "Then, Your Majesty, do you mean that there will be no more bridges on that cliff?"

Lanisi sighed and said, "The twenty thousand troops of the Bolton Nation were completely wiped out in this battle. They will definitely not let the matter rest. The snow forest in front of them can no longer stop them. If we take the initiative to repair the bridge, the orc army can march in at any time and attack the city. At that time, there will be no retreat for us elves."

Chu Xiaoye frowned and thought carefully. His eyes suddenly lit up as he thought of the pterodactyl. "Your Majesty, where's your dragon?"

Lanisi said with a depressed expression, "Dolma is seriously injured. I'm afraid it can't recover in a short time."

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "I remember that there are still three green pterodactyls in Elf City, right?"

Lanisi sighed again and said, "During the battle yesterday, the canyon was filled with flames and the orcs roared like thunder. The three green pterodactyls were terrified. In the end, they all fled and have yet to return."

Chu Xiaoye's expression froze. He looked at her suspiciously and said, "Your Majesty, are you sure that you're not lying to me?"

Lanisi looked at him sincerely and said, "I'm not joking. I'm not lying\!"

That night, Chu Xiaoye could not sleep at all.

After dawn, he personally went to ask about Vilis, Annie, Fei'er, and even Denise and the other elven girls. He received the same answer as the queen and not a word less.

Chu Xiaoye became even more suspicious.

However, in their territory, even if he knew that they had worked together to deceive him, what could he do?

After eating an exquisite breakfast, Vilis carried her huge sword and came to him, saying that she wanted to teach him how to practice the sword.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and brought Catherine out of the city. They passed through the canyon and came to the cliff again, thinking about how to leave.

At this moment, a green pterodactyl flew over the canyon and landed in Elf City.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and said angrily to the huge sword loli behind him, "Liar\!"

Vilis did not blush at all and continued to act stupid. "What? That was a messenger pigeon just now. It's just a larger messenger pigeon. It can't carry people."

Chu Xiaoye was angry. He pulled out the sword at his waist with a clang and said to her, "Vilis, I hope you can tell me the truth. Has your queen never thought of letting me go?"

Vilis looked at the sword in his hand and said with a puzzled expression, "I don't know why you have to leave. Her Majesty is willing to share the throne with you, and he's also willing to marry Princess Nalia to you, even giving you Denise and Fei'er. Our Elf Kingdom is so beautiful and the girls are so beautiful. Aren't you tempted at all?"

"Tempted?"

Chu Xiaoye revealed a mocking expression and sheathed his sword. He said, "That's a relationship only humans and elves have. I'm a lion. I only yearn for the grassland and the blue sky, joy and freedom. There's no such thing here."

Vilis was even more puzzled. "But you're already an elf like us. This should be your home, right?"

Chu Xiaoye did not want to talk nonsense with her anymore. He walked past her with Catherine and said, "I'll go find the Queen. If she's still unwilling, don't blame me for being impolite."

Vilis hurriedly turned around and caught up to him. She frowned and said, "Are you going to hold the Queen hostage?"

Chu Xiaoye stopped and sneered. "Am I that stupid? This is her territory. Why should I hold her hostage? I can use a more effective and safer method."

Vilis asked curiously, "What method?"

"Marry her."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly said these two words that shocked Vilis.

"After I marry her and become her man, I can order her to send me out as her husband. If she doesn't follow my orders, I can rightfully beat and abuse her every day and fool around with other girls. For example, Denise, Fei'er, and even that Princess Nalia, you, Vilis… I can anger her to death\!"

Chu Xiaoye said with revenge.

Vilis' face immediately turned red with anger. "Scum\!"

Chu Xiaoye said, "Wrong, it's lion dregs\! Or rather, elven dregs\! I'm happy that I'm trash. What do you care?"

"Shameless\!"

Vilis swung her fist at his nose.

Chu Xiaoye was already prepared. He swayed his head and immediately took a few steps back, reminding her, "Lady Vilis, you should not treat your elves' benefactor like this. Even if I abandoned the queen and all the girls in the elven race, you should suffer silently. Because your lives, your cities, and everything you have is all given to you by me."

Vilis clenched her fists and glared. "That's why I used my fist and not my sword\! Lion dregs\! I will never let you hurt Her Majesty\!"

With that said, the giant sword elf ran away angrily.

Obviously, she had gone to inform her beloved queen.

Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry. He brought Catherine and walked slowly behind.

There were elves patrolling in the canyon. When they saw him, they greeted him warmly and respectfully. Some gossipers would even smile and say, "I heard that Lord Night and Her Majesty are about to get married. Congratulations, Lord Night."

No one knew who released the news. It seemed that everyone knew.

Although he firmly rejected it last night, this news still spread.

Obviously, she was deliberately forcing him.

Chu Xiaoye hated such schemes, so he would never agree.

"Congratulations to you too. Her Majesty the Queen said that after she gets married to me, she'll give all of you beautiful elves to me—let me eat them as snacks. You also know that I'm actually a lion and love to eat delicate little girls like you the most. They must taste delicious."

Usually, he would answer those gossipy little elves like this.

However, the little elves were not afraid. Instead, they grinned and said, "We're all very happy and honored to be eaten by Lord Night. Please, Lord Night, come and eat quickly."

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye felt that there was definitely something wrong with the brains of these little elves.

Along the way, everyone would smile and greet him when they saw him. They did not feel restrained and were very friendly. They could see sincere gratitude and happiness on their young and exquisite faces.

To be honest, this place was quite good.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew clearly that he did not belong here.

After entering the palace, Fei'er was waiting for him at the door.

This elf girl with long pink hair was wearing a pink dress today and dressed cutely. She still had the beautiful, lively, and pure sweet smile on her face.

"Lord Night, are you going to see Her Majesty?"

It seemed that the huge sword loli had already finished reporting.

Chu Xiaoye nodded and said, "Lead the way."

Fei'er walked in front and said, "Her Majesty is discussing something in the meeting room. Lord Night can enter at any time."

Chu Xiaoye mocked, "Are you discussing how to lie to me? Fei'er, you've disappointed Lord Night too much. I thought that you were pure, kind, and never lied. Who knew that you would actually collude with them and lie to Lord Night. Doesn't your conscience hurt?"

Fei'er's face immediately turned red and she said anxiously, "Lord Night, I… I…"

"What about me?"

Chu Xiaoye said angrily, "I saw the pterodactyl in the canyon just now. Your lie will be broken by itself\!"

Fei'er lowered her head in shame and hit the stone pillar beside her with a bang. Her eyes were filled with tears from the pain.

She was clearly wrong, but at this moment, looking at her pitiful, ashamed, and about to cry, Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt that he was wrong.

"Lord… Lord Night, I'm sorry…"

Fei'er held back her tears and apologized with a red face.

She was also following orders. Furthermore, she really did not want Lord Night to leave.

Chu Xiaoye waved his hand and said magnanimously, "I'm not angry at you. It has nothing to do with you. Let's go."

Fei'er's eyes were filled with gratitude. She continued to lead the way in front, seemingly unable to bear it. She suddenly said in a low voice, "Lord Night, actually, regarding the news that you're going to marry Her Majesty, it's… Her Majesty who instructed me to spread it…"

Heh, a noble and cunning queen\!

Chu Xiaoye looked down on her deeply\!

In order to keep him here, they really did everything\!

"Also, Lord Night, Lady Vilis is also in the conference room, saying bad things about you to the Queen angrily."

The pink-haired girl could not help but reveal something.

After saying that, she regretted it a little and said with tears in her eyes, "I… I'm a traitor."

When he reached the door of the conference room, the door happened to open. The imperial guard, Loli, walked out with a grave expression. She looked at him and left in a hurry, as if there was something urgent.

Fei'er said carefully at the door, "Your Majesty, Lord Night is here."

Inside, Lanisi said softly, "Night, come in. I was about to let Denise look for you."

Hmph, hypocritical\!

After hearing Vilis' report, she had already told Fei'er to wait outside\!

Chu Xiaoye walked into the meeting room and saw that there were not many people sitting inside. Only the Queen, Vilis, and Princess Annie were sitting. Denise and the other two imperial guards were standing at the side.

"Night, we might have more trouble coming. I need your opinion."

Lanisi looked at him worriedly. There was a letter on the table in front of her, and her expression was very serious.

As for Princess Annie, the giant sword loli, and the others, their expressions were not too good.

At this moment, in this atmosphere, Chu Xiaoye should not have questioned her again, but he still could not help but say, "Your Majesty, tell me about me first. I just saw a green pterodactyl return."

"He left again."

Lanisi spread her hands on the table and said helplessly.

Chu Xiaoye wanted to say, "Who are you lying to?" However, he still needed to respect Her Majesty a little.

"Please let me leave."

Chu Xiaoye went straight to the point.

Lanisi looked at him calmly. After a moment, she stood up and moved the chair beside her out from under the table. She said, "Night, come and sit. Let's talk about the trouble our elf race encountered first."

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and did not move. He said, "Sorry, I've already helped you resolve a problem. Next, you have to rely on yourselves. Catherine and I have to leave."

Lanisi stood there and looked at him with a complicated gaze. Gradually, a begging expression appeared on her face. She supported the back of the chair and said, "Night, sit down. Let me tell you about the current situation, okay? Please."

The Queen begged again.

However, Chu Xiaoye still did not relent and continued, "Sorry, I have to leave."

Lanisi stood there with her brows lowered, looking at him pitifully.

Annie, who was sitting at the side, suddenly said, "Night, sit down first. What we want to talk about is not only about us elves, but also about your previous world and… your little friends on the grassland."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He immediately walked in front of the chair the Queen pulled out and sat down. He suddenly had an ominous feeling.

Lanisi walked in front of her seat and sat down. She sighed and looked at him. "Maria brought back news that the orcs of the Bolton Kingdom are transferring back the army at the other borders and preparing to gather another thirty thousand troops to continue attacking our elves. Furthermore, this time, they also borrowed a team of well-equipped wyvern warriors and are preparing to attack from the sky. Night, this time, our Elf Kingdom will probably not be able to resist them anymore."

Chu Xiaoye listened patiently and said coldly, "Your Majesty, this is not what I want to hear."

Lanisi's eyes revealed a hint of sadness and she fell silent.

Annie said, "The reason why the Bolton Kingdom is in such a hurry to conquer our Elven Kingdom is not just to take revenge. They have obtained the news that the small world you used to be in is about to collapse. Humans and animals are infected and devoured by a strange virus and have become red-eyed monsters that only know how to kill. The entire world is in chaos, and only a few creatures are struggling. The ground, the sky, the underground, and the sea are erupting with all sorts of disasters in an attempt to destroy those terrifying monsters. However, what they will destroy is the entire world. All creatures, including your grassland, will be destroyed…"

"I once told you that all the creatures in that world are only shadows of this place. It's actually not appropriate. Shadows are dead and have no life, but all the creatures there are alive and well. However, they do rely on the creatures here to survive. If they die here, the ones outside will also die from all sorts of accidents and illnesses. Furthermore, they will be caught off guard."

"Only when you come here and see your true self like you do will you watch him die in front of you and let his soul and body be devoured by you. Only then will you become the only true you. You will be truly free."

"Night, what I said is true. Please believe me. Because this is very important."

Annie looked at him and said solemnly.

Chu Xiaoye's mind buzzed like thunder. For a moment, he could not accept it.

At first, he did not believe it. However, when he heard the red-eyed monsters, he knew that those things were probably really happening or had already happened.

He had seen those terrifying red-eyed monsters with his own eyes, as well as things that had become red-eyed monsters. He had also seen the huge demon mosquitoes and the dense army of demon mosquitoes in the sky.

When he left, the world had already undergone a tremendous change.

Therefore, at this moment, when this elf girl said that all sorts of disasters were erupting in that world and were about to be destroyed, he believed her.

Because the Earth he had once stayed on had been destroyed many times.

"Night, there's a Half Moon Mountain beside Dark Night Mountain in the back mountain of our elf race. There's an altar on it. The Bolton orcs want to occupy that altar this time."

"Because when the outside world is about to be destroyed, all the surviving creatures outside are looking for a last chance to survive. That altar can open the barrier that you used to enter and let the people outside in. The Bolton orcs are very ambitious. Not only do they want to conquer us elves, they also want to unite all the orc countries and fight humans. Therefore, they need more troops, more creatures to mate with them, and produce more, stronger, smarter, and many types of warriors."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stood up from the chair and looked at her. "You're saying that there's an altar in the back mountain of your Elf City, and that altar can open the barrier that we entered previously so that the people outside can enter?"

Annie nodded. "Yes. That altar is something our elves have always been guarding."

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the Queen. "Your Majesty, I need to use that altar. After I bring my pride here, I will stay here forever and serve you, never leaving\!"

Lanisi sighed and looked at him in distress. "Night, you can use that altar at any time. You can use everything of us elves unconditionally. However, you might not know yet that it's not easy to activate that altar. You need a lot of energy. And this energy is something only the high priest in our Elf Kingdom has. Only she knows the way to open the altar."

"High Priest?"

When Chu Xiaoye heard this name again, his heart suddenly trembled. His face was pale as he said, "The high priest is still unconscious, right?"

Lanisi nodded, her brows filled with worry. "The high priest expended too much energy previously and was injured in the battle with the orcs. I heard from Nalia that the high priest sealed himself in the secret room of Half Moon Mountain. He probably won't wake up for a year."

"A year?"

Chu Xiaoye fell into a chair with an ugly expression.

Suddenly, he thought of something and looked at her. "Your Majesty, since you asked me to discuss, there should be other ways, right? As long as you can reactivate that altar, open the barrier there, and let my pride in. No matter what orders you have, just let me know\!"

Lanisi looked at Annie beside her and said, "Annie, you should say it."

Annie knew how anxious he was. She did not beat around the bush and said with a complicated expression, "There is still one person in our elf race who can reactivate that altar. However, that person is not here now. He is living with humans in the human countries."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly remembered what they had said previously. Back then, the elves had been divided into three groups because of various conflicts. One group went to a place without humans and orcs and hid. One group stayed here, and the other went to the human world and merged with humans, making them very prosperous.

Annie continued, "We need to go there, to the human countries, and find her. Not only can she reactivate the altar at the back of the mountain, she can also restore the destroyed snow forest and the ice bridge. Furthermore, she can also set up a stronger concealment barrier outside so that the orcs will never be able to find us."

Chu Xiaoye took a deep breath and nodded. "I understand."

If he could find that person, not only could he save Little Curly Tail and the others from the world that was about to be destroyed outside, he could also fulfill his promise to the little girl named Lisa to protect the elves. It was killing two birds with one stone.

Although he felt like he was being used, he did not hesitate anymore. He looked at the Queen and asked, "When do we set off?"

Lanisi looked at him in surprise and said, "Any time. If your wounds are healed. Night, thank you."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly smiled and said, "Your Majesty, can we really set off at any time? However, there's no bridge on the cliff and you don't have a dragon. How should we set off?"

The Queen's fair face suddenly blushed and she lowered her head in embarrassment. Her voice was as small as a mosquito. "Night, sorry…"

"You don't have to apologize, because you're the queen, the high and mighty queen."

Chu Xiaoye mocked again and said, "How many people do you need?"

Annie said, "The fewer people, the better. Otherwise, we'll be easily discovered when we cross the orc country. You're the most intelligent, so you naturally have to follow. I, Vilis, Denise, will do."

Fei'er, who was standing at the side, said anxiously, "Princess, what about me? My archery is also very good. I won't implicate you."

Annie was about to speak when Lanisi suddenly looked at her and said, "Annie, you can't go. I'll go. Fei'er can follow."

When this was said, everyone was stunned.

Fei'er hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, you're still injured. Furthermore, you're the queen and can't leave our Elf Kingdom."

Vilis nodded and said, "Fei'er is right. Your Majesty, you can't go. You might encounter orcs on the way. Furthermore, humans also have many cunning and sly bad people. It will be very dangerous."

Lanisi shook her head and looked at Annie. "I have to go. Annie, High Priest Senna will not want to see you. If you bring them there, she will definitely not return to help us. I think you know better than anyone."

Annie's eyes revealed a hint of bitterness and she whispered, "Sister, you're the queen. If you leave, what will happen to the Elven Kingdom?"

Lanisi looked at her with bright eyes and said softly, "Annie, what about you? If you stay, you can definitely help me protect the Elf Kingdom. Although Nalia has never cared about these secular matters, as long as you find her when you're in trouble, she will definitely be willing to help you. After all, she's our biological sister."

Annie was still worried. She looked at her worriedly and said, "Sister, we'll definitely encounter many dangers on the way. Can you take care of yourself?"

Lanisi smiled and looked at Chu Xiaoye, then at Alice and the others. "Of course, there's still them. I'm not a child. Nothing can stump me. Annie, don't worry."

Annie stopped talking.

She knew that no one could change her sister's decision. Furthermore, she knew that her sister could only go personally because the high priest named Senna once owed her sister her life.

"Can we set off tomorrow?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the Queen, feeling impatient.

Just as Lanisi was about to speak, Annie hurriedly begged, "Night, wait for a few more days, okay? There are arrow wounds on Sister's arms and legs, and the wounds are very deep. If you move for a while more, the wounds will open and bleed. If we're in a hurry to travel tomorrow, Sister will definitely be unable to hold on."

Lanisi sighed and said apologetically, "Night, I'm sorry…"

The Queen suddenly felt that she was a burden and a big liar.

She had just boasted that she could set off at any time.

Chu Xiaoye frowned and said, "Do you know how long the outside world can last?"

Lanisi shook her head and said, "Who knows? However, according to the news from the orcs, they should be able to last for another year and a half. After all, the humans and mutated animals outside are very strong. Now that they're facing a threat, they've already started to work together to fight the enemy. The grassland you've stayed in before is still calm.

Nothing dangerous happened. "

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. "Alright, Your Majesty, let's not be in a hurry. Recuperate well. After you recover, we'll set off."

At this moment, Annie, who was sitting opposite him, suddenly looked at him with a burning gaze and said, "Night, the wounds on your body are much more serious than my sister's. You're already healed, right?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he rubbed his back. When he was about to leave previously, he still felt a little pain, but now, he no longer felt any pain.

The wound might not have been completely healed, but it should be almost healed.

"I once saw you using your tongue to heal Catherine and the others."

Annie looked at him with bright eyes and said, "Night, your body seems to be very magical. When the high priest summoned me and I emitted that energy, you breathed for a few days and became stronger. There should be a very powerful energy in your body, right? Since you can help Catherine and the others heal, you can definitely help my sister heal, right?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in a daze. If not for her reminder, he would have really forgotten the mysterious effect of his saliva.

However…

"Princess, you saw it back then. I use my tongue…"

Chu Xiaoye said embarrassedly.

The noble and holy queen was injured in her thighs and arms. If it was her head and hands, or her mouth and feet, pfft, pfft, pfft\! What was I thinking? I'm a lion\! A lion that's called a righteous gentleman\!

Annie suddenly stood up and said to Alice, Denise, and the others, "Let's go out."

Everyone widened their confused eyes and looked at her in a daze. For a moment, they could not understand.

Even the Queen looked confused.

Annie was helpless. She could only explain seriously, "Sister, Night can heal you. Although the arrow wounds on your legs and arms have been smeared with medicine, the wounds heal very slowly and will tear and bleed again at any time. However, if Night helps you heal, you should recover very quickly. Look at him. In less than a day, the wound on his back that could have been fatal has already healed."

Lanisi's eyes lit up and she said in surprise, "Night, really? Are you that powerful? Other than resisting the orcs, do you know how to heal?"

Fei'er's face was red as she said excitedly and admiringly, "Lord Night is so strong. Oh, no, he's so powerful\! He's really Fei'er's idol."

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes.

Fei'er said excitedly, "Wow\! Lord Night can even roll his eyes. So cute\!"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

I'll shut up and close my face, okay?

"Night, can you help me? If the wounds on my body heal sooner, we can go on our way early."

Lanisi said expectantly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said, "Your Majesty, I can indeed try. However, the princess still hasn't told you the most important thing."

Lanisi looked at Annie.

Annie was a little embarrassed, but she could not care less about these trifles at this time. She said, "Sister, Night's treatment requires him to use his tongue. You should know that if there are wounds on an animal, it will lick them with its tongue. You need to take off your clothes. You don't have to take them off completely. You only need to show your injured arm and thigh. Then, sit quietly on the bed and let Night help you…"

Lanisi blushed and bit her lips. She whispered, "Does he need to become a lion?"

If he became a lion, at least he would not be so embarrassed.

Annie was stunned for a moment, as if she had never thought of this question.

She looked at the youth opposite her and said, "Do you need it?"

Chu Xiaoye also asked himself, "Do you need it?"

At this moment, Fei'er, who was standing at the side, suddenly said, "Princess, you said that Lord Night needs to use his tongue to heal his wounds, right? That must be because of his saliva. Lord Night's saliva can heal and heal wounds. Therefore, everyone doesn't have to be embarrassed. Lord Night only needs to drool into the cup and drool more. Then, I'll help His Majesty apply it on his wounds. Hehe, is Fei'er smart?"

This pink-haired elf girl was grinning and looking pleased as she waited for everyone to praise her.

However, no one seemed to care about her.

Annie said with a wooden face, "Let's go out."

Fei'er was puzzled and continued to speak foolishly, "Princess, did you not hear what I said just now? We don't have to go out at all. Her Majesty only needs saliva and Lord Night's saliva\!"

Annie rubbed her forehead and closed her eyes.

Denise, who was standing beside Fei'er, could not help but touch her body. However, she still did not realize that she had said something wrong.

The atmosphere was suddenly a little awkward.

Lanisi could only blush and blink her long eyelashes. She looked at the youth in front of her and said, "Night, Fei'er said that I only… only need saliva. Can I?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and actually hesitated. Furthermore, he actually stammered and said with an uncertain expression, "This… Actually, I'm not too sure either. When I usually treat Catherine and the others, no matter where I treat them, I usually use… to close my mouth and then use my tongue…"

Catherine, who was standing under the chair beside him, suddenly mimicked him and rolled her eyes.

Who was he kidding\!

Annie said solemnly, "Sister, don't waste time. It's just licking your wounds a few times. It'll pass soon and there won't be any pain. You can definitely hold on."

Lanisi was speechless.

Of course, she could persevere, but could everyone stop looking at her with their eyes wide open? If she did not go out, what was she waiting for? Could she still wait to see her blush, embarrassed, and look like a shy little girl?

She was a queen, a high and noble and cold queen\!

"Cough cough."

She could only bite the bullet and stand up. She looked at them sternly and said, "It's not early anymore. We've had a long meeting. Everyone is hungry, right? Alright, go back first. You don't need to accompany me here."

"Yes, Sister. We'll leave first."

Annie walked over, grabbed Fei'er, who was about to speak, and walked out the door.

Denise and the others walked to the door.

Chu Xiaoye also stood up.

The Queen hurriedly blushed and whispered, "Night, don't leave first. You still have to heal me."

Annie suddenly said from the door, "Sister, it's not convenient here. Let's return to your room."

With that said, she blinked at the Queen and pulled the confused Fei'er out quickly.

When only the Queen and Chu Xiaoye were left in the meeting room, the Queen tried her best to show a frank smile and pretended to be calm. "Night, let's go. I have everything in my room and it's very quiet. No one will disturb me."

Looking at the Queen's watery eyes and bright smile, Chu Xiaoye immediately panicked.

He hurriedly picked up a red wine glass from the table and poured a bit of red wine on the ground. "Your Majesty, I just thought about it carefully. I think my saliva should be useful. I'll help you accumulate saliva. In a while, let Denise or Fei'er return to your room with you and help you apply it to your wound. It should heal very quickly."

Lanisi was originally a little shy and uncomfortable. At this moment, seeing him like this, she immediately laughed and looked at him with her bright eyes and white teeth. "Night, you look very afraid, right? Are you afraid that your queen will suddenly show a ferocious face and bloody mouth and eat you after bringing you to her room?"

When she said this, Chu Xiaoye was even more afraid.

"Hehe, Your Majesty must be joking. I'm not even afraid of terrifying orcs, so why would I be afraid of you?"

Chu Xiaoye said awkwardly and quietly took a few steps back. Then, he lowered his head and placed the wine glass on his lips. He held the corner of his mouth and prepared to accumulate saliva.

Lanisi looked at him with a burning gaze. She took a few steps closer and almost stuck to him. She reached out and grabbed his hand, saying gently, "Night, you shouldn't be afraid of me. I'm indeed a queen, but I'm also a girl. If you do this, I'll feel that I'm a failure and a sorry figure. Are you despising me?"

Chu Xiaoye took a step back and pulled his hand out of her soft palm. He placed the wine glass on the table and changed the topic. "Your Majesty, I remember. I should only have the healing effect of saliva after I become a lion."

Then, he lowered his body and turned into a lion. He happened to see Catherine standing at his feet, looking at him in a daze, as if she was a little sad.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and did not think much of it. He suddenly jumped up and jumped onto the table. He wrapped his mouth around the edge of the wine glass and patiently drooled.

However, after a long time, no saliva flowed down.

"Could it be because I haven't eaten meat recently?"

Chu Xiaoye thought to himself and was a little anxious.

Just like Catherine, who was staring at his queen with a sad gaze, she suddenly loosened the belt at her waist and said softly, "Night, since you've already become a lion, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. Let's heal here."

Right at this moment, the voice of the guard captain, Loli, suddenly came from outside the door. "Your Majesty, Princess Nalia has returned from the back mountain. She wants to see you. Also, she said that she hopes you can bring Lord Night along. She also wants to see Lord Night."

The Queen's loosened belt fell to the ground and landed on Catherine.

Catherine let out a roar and suddenly bit the soft and smooth brand new coat belt, biting a few holes in it. Her dark eyes were filled with anger and anger. She looked like a little girl who had seen her beloved little boy holding hands with another little girl and forcefully kissing her.

Lanisi could only pick up her belt and tie it back to her waist. Her cheeks were dyed red as she whispered, "Night, let's go. Let's go see Nalia first. Tonight, after we eat dinner, you can help me heal."

With that said, she bent down and picked up his clothes from the ground. She stared at him with a burning gaze, waiting for him to transform.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the table, not sure if he should change or not. He was rather embarrassed and could only say, "Your Majesty, help me put my clothes on the table. Go out first. My stomach suddenly hurts, so why should I fart first? It's probably a big smelly fart."

The Queen's expression changed when she heard that. She immediately thought of the terrifying stench of black fog rolling over that day\!

The big smelly fart that day was already so terrifying. Wasn't this big smelly fart even more terrifying and terrifying?

She did not hesitate and immediately walked out quickly, panicking and staggering. She no longer had the noble and calm posture of a queen.
