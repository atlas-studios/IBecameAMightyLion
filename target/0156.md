Chapter 156: The Powerful Lion King

The water buffaloes were in chaos.

The three female lions continued to chase away the herd.

The other three female lions cut off the water buffalo and the herd that could not move freely and started to hunt.

The water buffalo panicked and started to run in another direction.

However, two more female lions appeared in front of him.

The leading lioness, who was running with this water buffalo, jumped and pounced on it. Her sharp claws grabbed the water buffalo's back and hung on its body, starting to bite. 

Just as the other lionesses were about to pounce on them, the water buffalo suddenly stopped running and turned around. It lowered its head and used the sharp horns on its head to deal with them.

The female lions immediately retreated and circled to the side.

At this moment, the few female lions blocking the front also rushed over to help.

The two female lions suddenly pounced from behind. One bit its thigh and the other climbed onto its butt and bit its spine.

At this moment, another female lion jumped up and jumped onto the water buffalo's back. She actually rode on its back and started biting.

In the blink of an eye, nine female lions had already surrounded the water buffalo and started to attack from all directions.

The water buffalo turned its body slower and slower. The back half of its body could not withstand the weight of the lion and its hind legs gradually bent. Then, it could not help but sit down.

Just as its butt landed, the other lionesses took this opportunity to pounce on it\!

A female lion pounced in front of it from the side and bit its mouth. All its weight was hanging there.

The water buffalo's neck immediately bent down and its two front legs could not help but kneel on the ground.

It finally fell.

However, it was unwilling to be eaten by these hunters and started to struggle violently again.

At this moment, the three female lions that were chasing away the water buffaloes also rushed back and pounced on its neck, pressing it down.

The water buffalo let out a miserable and desperate cry.

However, the cows not far away only watched helplessly and did not come to save them.

If a strong water buffalo was in trouble, perhaps after the herd calmed down, they would chase the lions away under the lead of their leader.

However, this water buffalo was already old and crippled. It was useless to the herd.

Useless members were destined to be eliminated.

Soon, under the siege of the thirteen female lions, the water buffalo gave up struggling. It widened its eyes and lay there, waiting for death.

Not far away.

Chu Xiaoye, who was hiding in the grass, was a little hesitant.

This pride actually had thirteen female lions and looked very strong. Was there a need for him to take the risk to snatch some food to eat?

A female tiger was not to be trifled with, and neither was a lioness.

Furthermore, these female lions looked much stronger than the female lions on the grassland over there. Their bodies were almost equal to that of the Chino brothers\!

The favorable environment and stronger competition here made their genes stronger every generation.

He, who had just turned one, was a joke in front of the lionesses in terms of body size.

However, who said that size could decide everything?

His speed and strength were enough for him to escape after snatching the food\!

He was the future king of the grassland. How could he be scared away by these women and tremble in fear?

As a newcomer, he had to prove himself\! He had to give himself the strongest confidence\!

Otherwise, how could he expand his territory and become the king here in the future?

"Roar—"

He suddenly let out a lion's roar and stood up from the grass.

Then, he raised his head and walked towards the thirteen female lions and the dying water buffalo.

He wanted them to know that the little lion in front of them was not to be trifled with\! From his walking posture and confident attitude, they were going to be unlucky\!

Unless they gave him something to eat.

When the thirteen female lions heard his roar, they raised their heads and looked at him strangely.

They did not seem to feel any fear. Instead, their eyes looked like they were looking at an idiot.

Chu Xiaoye sneered in his heart and strode over to stand in front of them. He looked askance and had a proud expression as he let out a threatening growl.

He seemed to be saying, "Quick, give me something to eat\!"

If these women dared to resist, he would definitely slap them and break their teeth\!

However…

The expressions of the thirteen female lions seemed to be wrong.

Chu Xiaoye looked at their gazes and was stunned for a moment. Then, his heart suddenly skipped a beat. He quickly turned around and looked behind him.

Ten meters behind him, three tall and strong lions with black manes walked over side by side.

They were almost bigger than the cold father. Their manes extended to their waists. The muscles on their four legs were bulging, and their heads were big and round. Their entire bodies looked like moving hills\!

Their faces were dignified without being angry and looked exceptionally terrifying\!

They did not run or roar. They did not even show their fangs.

They only walked side by side, walking very slowly and calmly. There was almost no anger in their cold gazes, only faint disdain.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt his legs go limp.

This strong aura that pounced at him made the instinctive fear of an adult lion in his bones emerge again\!

These three lions were larger and more terrifying than any lion he had seen on the grassland\!

He instinctively felt terrified.

Obviously, he was not a match for them.

These three adult lions were huge and muscular. Any one of them weighed more than 300 kilograms and was three times his weight\!

How could he resist them?

If he slapped them, they might just tilt their head.

When they slapped him, he would immediately fall to the ground and would never get up again.

They were not at the same level at all\!

This was a sad thing.

If they did not do well, their confidence would collapse.

Furthermore, the back path was blocked and he could not escape from there.

However, he was unwilling to accept this.

He had to do something to recover a little of his dignity as a future lion. Only then could he comfort his dejected and sad heart a little.

He turned around and looked at the 13 female lions.

The thirteen female lions looked at him with disdain.

They bit their prey and looked up at his joke.

Chu Xiaoye immediately walked over.

The thirteen female lions were stunned, but they were not afraid at all. They stared at him coldly and did not even get up.

"Pfft—"

Chu Xiaoye had just walked in front of them when he suddenly turned around and raised his tail. An explosion suddenly came from behind him, and then a large amount of black smoke suddenly spewed out\!

An extremely smelly and terrifying smoke instantly enveloped the entire water buffalo and the thirteen female lions\!

"Pfft—"

Another explosion\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped onto the water buffalo and spat out another mouthful of black feces from behind, scattering them all on the water buffalo's corpse\!

"Eat\! You guys eat\!"

Chu Xiaoye sneered in his heart. He felt that he still had not vented his anger. He turned around and looked at the three adult lions that were running over quickly. He suddenly jumped onto a female lion and sat on her head, wiping his butt with her head\!

Then, he ran away\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

Behind him, dense vomiting sounds immediately came\!

The thirteen female lions immediately lay on the ground and vomited. They were dizzy and could not stand up at all\!

When the three lions circled around the black smoke and ran to the back, Chu Xiaoye had already fled 100 meters away.

"Roar—"

A terrifying roar suddenly sounded on the vast grassland\!

The tall and mighty lion king was finally angry\!

It, who had been calm just now, was now furious. Its face was distorted from anger and its entire body was trembling\!

It immediately brought the other two lions and roared as they chased after him\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to look back and continued to run into the distance\!

After running for about twenty kilometers, he stopped while panting.

He could already hear the roars of the three lions from behind.

Not only were those three fellows strong and huge, but their endurance was also extremely astonishing. They were actually chasing after him all this time.

After walking for a distance, he suddenly smelled a strong scent on the grass.

This was the aura left behind by the three lions after marking their territory.

It seemed that he had already escaped their territory.

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief and decided to find a place to rest for a while before looking for something to eat.

She was tired and hungry. It was killing her.

Not far ahead, a large forest appeared.

There should be many prey hiding there.

At this moment, the sun had already set and a crescent moon rose into the night sky.

On this beautiful grassland, the night sky was especially beautiful.

The bright crescent moon and the stars in the sky were almost inches away from each other and were exceptionally clear.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not in the mood to enjoy the beautiful scenery.

He was hungry, his mouth was dry, and he was extremely tired. Now, he only wanted to rest and eat.

Not long after.

He walked into the lush forest and lay down in the grass to rest.

After recovering some strength, he got up and walked into the depths of the bushes, preparing to catch prey to fill his stomach.

Soon, he discovered a thin and tender black antelope.

This black antelope was also extremely strong. The horns on its forehead were also exceptionally sharp, like two sickles hanging on it.

However, to him, this was a piece of fresh meat that could move. No matter how strong it was, it could not escape the fate of being eaten by him.

"Whoosh—"

Using the cover of the grass, he sneaked close and pounced\!

The black antelope suddenly jumped up and prepared to escape\!

However, just as it jumped up, Chu Xiaoye had already pounced on it and bit its neck, dragging it to the ground\!

The strong black antelope was unwilling to be eaten and struggled with all its might.

"Crack\!"

Chu Xiaoye bit its throat and started to drink blood happily.

After a moment, the black antelope completely stopped breathing.

Chu Xiaoye got up, walked to its abdomen, and lay down, preparing to eat.

At this moment, in the forest beside him, two tall and strong rhinoceroses suddenly rushed out with a whoosh. The horn on their foreheads pierced fiercely at him\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly jumped up and ran to the side.

The two strong rhinoceroses did not chase after him anymore. Instead, they stopped beside the black antelope and stared at him coldly.

Chu Xiaoye stood not far away, looking stunned.

Could it be that these two rhinoceroses also ate meat?

Just as he was feeling bewildered, another figure walked out from the forest.

It was a female cub about his size.

However, the fur on the lioness cub was actually snow white\!

She was like a proud little princess. She raised her chin slightly and walked over calmly, stopping in front of the black antelope.

She did not look at Chu Xiaoye. She lay on the ground and started eating.
