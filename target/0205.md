Chapter 205: The Evolution of the Claws

"Roar…"

The scar-faced lion king let out a hoarse growl.

There was the golden-clawed little lion king in front and the open-mouthed lioness in the back. Were they trying to kill them all?

Two cubs that smelled like milk actually dared to surround adult lions and female lions like them. They even thought they were invincible. It was the biggest joke in the world\!

The scar-faced lion king immediately roared angrily and immediately fled towards the forest on the right with his pride.

Then, they stopped.

A strong male leopard stood there and looked at them in a daze.

"Roar—"

The scar-faced lion king was furious\!

Now, not only were the two cubs bullying him, even this smelly leopard that had always been chased by lions was bullying them?

They were bullying him too much\!

He suddenly roared angrily and turned around again. He brought his pride and charged towards Chu Xiaoye\!

He knew that this young lion king was the most important and most powerful of the three. He could only face it and not turn his back on it\!

They could not move freely, and the other party was the same.

In this thick snow, no one could rely on their speed and strength to win the battle\!

Only a team could win\!

"Roar—"

Under the encouragement of the scar-faced lion king, the three lions and the three female lions' courage increased. They bared their fangs and charged forward ferociously\!

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and felt his body becoming hotter and hotter. At the same time, there was a hot airflow in his abdomen that he could not suppress and was about to erupt\!

His body trembled slightly and his muscles were tense. Even the tail behind his butt was almost stiff.

He really wanted to fight just now.

Now, he felt his entire body swell up and was about to explode\!

He really wanted to…

When the scar-faced lion king rushed over with three lions and three female lions roaring angrily, Chu Xiaoye could not tolerate it anymore. He suddenly turned around, curled his tail, and aimed his butt at them\!

"Boom —"

With a loud bang, the ground cracked\!

A black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind him like a violent hurricane\!

The terrifying airflow made the mane of the scar-faced lion king, who was baring its fangs and about to pounce on him, fly. Its face was distorted and its two ears swayed. Even the tongue in its mouth flew out\!

The three lions and three female lions following behind him were blown to the side and fell to the ground\!

A huge black smoke instantly enveloped them like a mushroom cloud\!

The scar-faced lion king stood in place with its mouth open. Its tongue was hanging at the corner of its mouth. The fur on its head and the side of its face flew back, as if it was a husky with a big back\!

Catherine, who was following behind the pride, was also stunned by this world-shaking super weapon\!

Not far away, the male leopard, Blue, was lying on the snow in fear with his eyes wide open.

A terrifying stench immediately spread in the forest.

The three lions and three female lions that had fallen to the ground were just about to get up when their bodies stiffened. They widened their eyes and fainted.

As for the scar-faced lion king's huge body, it was still standing in place without moving.

However, his comical appearance of sticking out his tongue and combing his hair made him look even more miserable.

Because he had just rushed at the front, bared his teeth, and opened his mouth, breathing heavily with his nostrils, the impact was the greatest.

He stood frozen in place as if he was stupid.

He had roamed the grassland his entire life and had never seen such a nuclear weapon or smelled such a terrifying stench\!

Some stenches made the enemy vomit, some stenches made the enemy flee, and some stenches made them poisoned. But today, this stench made him want to die for the first time.

It was too smelly\!

This stench entered his body, his blood, his bones, and his soul\!

Therefore, he was frozen in place and could not move.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

When Chu Xiaoye turned around and smelled the stench of the black smoke, he suddenly could not help but take a few steps back with a shocked expression.

This was really smelly\!

His stomach started to roll and his head was a little dizzy.

Ever since he was young, he had been used to his stench. He originally thought that no matter how smelly the world was, it would be a piece of cake for him. He could even open his mouth and suck it in.

But now, when he smelled the terrifying smoke he had just released, he completely understood a principle. There was a mountain beyond a mountain and a building beyond a building. There was no smelly stench, only worse stenches\!

"Ugh —"

He vomited.

For the first time, he vomited from his farts.

What monster could produce such a terrifying fart?

He was not a monster.

He looked at the snow deer not far away, then at the plant on the deer's head.

He thought of the fruit.

He had eaten the fruit without eating anything just now.

Then, his body started to heat up and his stomach started to feel uncomfortable.

Obviously, there was a problem with the fruit.

However, why was Catherine fine?

He looked at the female cub.

The lioness cub that had never abandoned or disliked him since she was young retreated into the distance. She was covering her nose with her claws, looking miserable, conflicted, terrified, and strange.

Obviously, she was already stunned.

Chu Xiaoye felt a little ashamed.

He had clearly wanted to fight just now. He had jumped nimbly from the tree and landed here silently, preparing to show his might and show his true abilities as a lion king, but in the end…

In the end, he farted\!

Furthermore, this fart was extraordinary. It did not differentiate between the enemy and the owner. Not only did it make the enemy faint, it also made him vomit.

This made him break down.

His lifelong reputation was ruined\!

"Roar—"

At this moment, the scar-faced lion king finally woke up. It suddenly roared angrily and bared its fangs\!

Then, he suddenly lowered his head and vomited.

The black smoke circling above their heads gradually dispersed with the cold wind in the forest. It drifted into the deeper forest and disappeared.

The three lions and the three female lions lying on the ground woke up one after another, but they were stunned and did not know what was happening.

When they saw their king vomiting crazily, they suddenly remembered the terrifying stench. Hence, they all lowered their heads and vomited.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched and his face was hot.

This made him feel even more uneasy than killing them personally.

However, Catherine was still cold and ruthless.

When this pitiful pride vomited crazily, she rushed over and started to open the stomachs of this group of lions like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves\!

Even the scar-faced lion king died unguarded under her sharp claws while vomiting.

Kill them all, eliminate them at the root, and leave none alive\!

Catherine the Ripper had a bloody face and a cold gaze, like a demon that had crawled up from hell.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that there were actually a few silver lights flickering on the tip of her bloody claws. Under the sun and snow, they were exceptionally dazzling.

It was only a small piece, a few millimeters, and it was identical to his golden claw back then\!
