Chapter 275: The dignity of the Cold Father

Two days later.

The entire team finally settled down in this new land.

Just like in the past.

A lioness nurtured her offspring and a lion patrolled the territory.

Occasionally, there would be some friction between prides. They would rely on the rules of the prides and use the decisive battle of lions to determine the victor.

However, they knew their limits and would not fight to the death.

The battle of prides was the product of nature's survival of the fittest. It had been like this since ancient times. Therefore, this friction could not be avoided.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye could also choose outstanding warriors from among them.

Therefore, he did not interfere and let nature take its course.

This new land was like a newly established kingdom, and it was divided into many big and small complicated forces. If he wanted to manage it one by one, he would definitely be exhausted.

Chu Xiaoye only needed to manage Lars and One-eye. As for the rest, he would let them and the managers they chose manage them.

As long as they listened to his orders and had him in their hearts, it would be enough.

As for the pride of the cold father, it was still the same as before. On the surface, the cold father was still the king, but in fact…

For example, now, the cold father was thirsty and wanted to drink water by the river.

However, everyone ignored him.

He could have slept well last night, but he wandered around and roared all night, afraid that the other prides would not know that he was the king's father. His tail almost stuck out into the sky.

In the end, early in the morning, his mouth was dry and his throat was smoking. He wanted to drink water.

No one was thirsty and wanted to sleep lazily. Now that the sun was high in the sky, who was willing to accompany him to the river?

Seeing that no one was paying attention to him, the cold father was furious. He widened his eyes in anger and immediately erupted with the dignity of a lion king, roaring again.

Thinking back, when Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail, and the others were still a few months old, they were terrified when they heard such a roar and trembled. The female lions were also terrified and trembling.

Now, such a roar could not cause any waves. It could not even cause a splash.

Everyone closed their eyes to sleep and pretended not to hear.

The cold father trembled in anger and looked at the female lions with a dignified and angry gaze.

Aisha and Xi'er did not even move their eyelids.

Maya and the two young cubs lay in the cave dug by the pit, sleeping soundly. He could not see each other at all.

As for Callie, she was resting under the tree.

On the tree, Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail, Tilly, Mei Mei, and Molly were sleeping. Catherine was also lying in the bushes beside the tree.

The muscles at the corner of the cold father's eyes twitched. The roar in his mouth gradually became smaller and then disappeared.

"Unfilial son\! Unfilial daughter\! Unfilial woman\!"

The cold father was very angry and sad. His mouth was dry and he was extremely thirsty, but he did not dare to go to the river alone. After all, the environment here was unfamiliar and there were wandering lions everywhere in groups. He did not know when those black lions would come. If they encountered danger, they would not respond every day and the ground would not work. That would be troublesome.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up as he thought of his other son\!

The current Lars was a lion with real power in the army. With a random order, he could send many lions to accompany him to the river to drink water. He was definitely impressive\!

Furthermore, this eldest son was very afraid of him. If he said one, the other party would not dare to say two. He would definitely listen to him and be respectful\!

At the thought of this, he was immediately excited. He immediately set off and walked towards the borders of the territory.

Lars was patrolling and checking the sentries of the other prides. He had been busy since last night and was more conscientious and diligent than ever.

When the cold father saw him, he immediately raised his head and stuck out his chest. He walked over with the pride of a lion king and his gaze was dignified. He let out a low growl.

"Son, come over. This King has something to tell you\!"

Lars turned around and looked puzzled, but he did not go over.

He still had to go to another territory to take a look.

The cold father immediately roared angrily and stopped in place, baring his fangs and glaring at him fiercely.

"Unfilial son\! Are you rebelling? This King asked you to come over, did you not hear me?"

Lars hesitated for a moment. Just as he was about to go over, the tall blue-eyed lion king suddenly walked over with the two lions and let him handle something.

Lars ignored his father and immediately followed the two lions and left in a hurry.

Just as the cold father was about to roar again, the blue eyes turned around.

The cold father opened his mouth, yawned, and turned to leave.

"Unfilial son\!"

He was filled with sadness, anger, and grievance. His throat was smoking and he was already extremely thirsty.

The morning sun baked him even more uncomfortably.

He could only walk into the bushes and return from the shade.

When he walked into an orchard, a fruit suddenly fell from above and hit his head.

The cold father was already filled with grievance and anger. He did not expect to be smashed when he walked. He immediately roared and looked up.

He thought that some damn monkey was teasing him.

Unexpectedly, the leopard sisters were on the tree.

The cold father knew that these two female leopards had a deep relationship with his unfilial son, so he had always been lazy to care about them. However, at this moment, these two girls took the initiative to provoke him. How could he tolerate it? He immediately glared at them and roared angrily.

"Smelly girl\! Come down if you have the ability. Do you believe that I will tear you into pieces\!"

"Roar\!"

Belia immediately mocked him and climbed down from the tree to stand in front of him. She swung her tail and swayed her butt, looking fearless and provocative.

"Don't believe me\! Come if you have the ability. If you dare to bully me, I'll tell your unfilial son\! Be careful that your unfilial son will abuse you again\!"

The cold father was furious.

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and turned to leave.

He was too thirsty. He had to drink some water to moisten his throat.

He, a dignified lion king, would not stoop to the level of this pair of little leopards that smelled like milk.

At this moment, another fruit fell from above and hit his head.

The cold father raised his head and roared angrily again.

Belita lay on the tree and roared at him. She wanted him to try it. It was very thirsty.

The cold father was stunned for a moment. He looked down at the green fruit on the ground and hesitated for a few seconds. He felt that his thirst was unbearable and could not take it anymore. He could only open his mouth and bite the fruit. With a crack, he bit the fruit to pieces.

Immediately, a cool juice filled his mouth. At the same time, an extremely sour and strange feeling rushed to his head\!

"Sss —"

He swallowed the cool juice in one mouthful and immediately felt the flames in his throat being extinguished. His entire body trembled in comfort. At the same time, he was so sour that his mouth and eyes were slanted and his head was swaying.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

On the tree, Belita saw that his appearance was almost identical to the first time she was forced to eat fruits by the big smelly fart. She immediately roared with laughter.

The cold father swallowed the fruit whole. Although it was extremely refreshing in his mouth, the thirst in his throat and the heat in his body immediately lessened.

His dispirited spirit instantly became excited.

"Roar—"

He raised his head and roared, letting Belita continue to pick fruits for him with a benevolent gaze.

Belita immediately extended her claws and slapped another one off for him, landing on the ground.

When Chu Xiaoye heard the cold father's roar and rushed over with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, he saw their father, who always maintained a dignified image, lying on the ground, eating the green fruits with his mouth and eyes slanted. His mouth was dripping with sour saliva and his entire body was trembling. However, he was as excited as the little leopard. He roared and twisted his butt around, looking pleased.

Chu Xiaoye and the other two froze in place, dumbfounded.
