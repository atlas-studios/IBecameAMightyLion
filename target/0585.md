Chapter 585: Killing at Night

"Roar —"

In the darkness, there were ferocious beasts roaring.

Pairs of cold eyes appeared from the dark corner.

However, when they saw the huge lion king in front of them, they quietly retreated.

Chu Xiaoye followed the scent and advanced between the dilapidated houses, ignoring the figures hiding in the darkness and looking at him in fear.

"Roar\!"

Suddenly, a huge monster walked out of the alley in front of him.

It was a saber-toothed tiger that was not inferior to him in size\!

The saber-toothed tiger raised its head and strode towards him with a cold gaze. The fangs outside its mouth were as sharp as daggers.

The ferocious beasts hiding in the surrounding darkness had something to rely on and surrounded him again.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and walked straight towards the powerful saber-toothed tiger in front of him, as if he ignored this powerful ancient ferocious beast.

The saber-toothed tiger seemed to have been provoked. Its face distorted and it became even more ferocious.

It suddenly roared angrily and jumped up. It raised its two huge iron claws and pounced forward\!

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with a cold light, as if he could see the scene of the saber-toothed tiger flaunting its might in their home and slaughtering wantonly.

He stopped and raised his head to look at the ferocious ancient ferocious beast.

"Whoosh\!"

He moved\!

Its huge body jumped up like lightning and rushed past the ancient ferocious beast\!

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

The saber-toothed tiger landed on the ground, but its raised huge claws flew out.

"Roar —"

The ancient ferocious beast immediately roared in pain. It actually turned around again and pounced forward.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not use his golden claws again.

He wanted to test how strong he was after transforming.

He turned around and stood in place without moving. When the ancient ferocious beast pounced in front of him, he suddenly raised his upper body and raised his right palm, slapping the saber-toothed tiger's face hard with a bang\!

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

The saber-toothed tiger's huge body was actually sent flying and it fell heavily seven to eight meters away. Its neck was broken and its face collapsed. It died instantly\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and raised his claws to look, feeling a little surprised.

This strength was actually more than ten times stronger than before\!

It seemed that this change was not just a change in his body. The strength and other energies in his body also increased.

When the container was big, there would naturally be more things in it. This was a principle.

The ferocious beasts that had already walked out of the darkness suddenly stopped in their tracks, then quickly retreated and completely disappeared into the darkness.

Although they were ordered to guard this place and not let anyone pass, they naturally had to choose to retreat and ignore death.

Yes, they pretended not to see anything.

Some were afraid, and some were naturally not.

The saber-toothed tiger was not the only competitor and opponent of lions.

When Chu Xiaoye walked for a distance, many green eyes suddenly appeared in the alley on both sides.

Then, more than twenty tall hyenas walked out with a murderous aura.

This time, they did not let out annoying cries again. Their cold eyes were filled with human-like bloodthirst and hatred.

Hyenas and lions were natural enemies.

Now, not only had they evolved and mutated, they had also obtained the violent genes injected into them by humans. Their strength had increased many times, and they were even more ferocious, smart, ruthless, and united.

There was no hyena queen here, only a team\!

They rushed up silently from both sides, showing even sharper fangs and a fierce expression.

However, no matter how much they changed, it could not change their strong nature.

Many spotted hyenas circled behind Chu Xiaoye and pounced from behind him.

The golden fur on Chu Xiaoye's body suddenly stood up and a black armor instantly condensed on his skin\!

"Whoosh\!"

He slapped his tail and slapped the mouths of a few spotted hyenas hard, breaking their fangs\!

Then, he suddenly jumped up, swung his golden claws, and jumped out of the hyenas' encirclement at lightning speed. When the hyenas changed directions and rushed over, he jumped in again.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Golden light flickered and flesh flew everywhere\!

In the blink of an eye, seven to eight strong and fierce hyenas fell into a pool of blood with their heads cut off\!

"Ahhh —"

At this moment, the remaining hyenas finally could not help but roar and pounce on him angrily.

Chu Xiaoye jumped behind them and did not continue to play with them in this way. He walked towards them and swung his golden claws as he walked forward\!

The sharp golden claws were now twenty centimeters long. When they were swung, they were like a few cold golden hooks. The hyenas that pounced on them were dismembered. Their heads were either separated from their bodies or their bodies were broken\!

For a moment, blood splashed, flesh flew, and broken limbs flew all over the ground\!

In the blink of an eye, another nine spotted hyenas fell into a pool of blood, dying miserably.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The remaining hyenas finally felt fear. Their previously murderous aura had long turned into pissing their pants.

They started to escape.

However, how could their speed compare to Chu Xiaoye's?

Chu Xiaoye's speed increased with his body and energy.

Even if they did not run in a jet style, they could make these brothers despair\!

"Whoosh\!"

He rushed out like a ghost and silently passed by the few spotted hyenas that were fleeing in panic with their tails between their legs. When his sharp golden claws passed by them, he had already kissed their flesh.

When he stood in front of these spotted hyenas, the spotted hyenas did not have the time to stop before they fell to the ground. Blood sprayed and they twitched a few times before they died\!

More than twenty spotted hyenas died in less than a few minutes\!

The ferocious beasts that were restless in the darkness ahead were terrified and quietly retreated.

Chu Xiaoye shook the blood on his body and continued forward.

He did not want to kill animals again, but these animals were no longer like in the past. They were no longer pure animals. They had been injected with a certain gene by humans and had become tools for humans to kill. They had become butchers who killed other animals\!

Therefore, he would never show mercy\!

A few figures appeared in front of him again. They were very big, and one of them was even larger than him\!

It was a huge lion with a lush mane and black and white fur\!

The lion's face and body were covered in scars. It looked like it had been through hundreds of battles and was extremely fierce\!

However, when Chu Xiaoye's gaze collided with his, they were stunned.

The black and white-haired giant lion's cold and fierce eyes flickered with confusion. It stared at him carefully, as if it was recalling something.

Chu Xiaoye froze in place and looked at him with a complicated gaze.
