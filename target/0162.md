Chapter 162: The Young King

The wandering lions were even more pleased with themselves.

They ignored the two foreign cowards and grinned as they walked towards the little elephant.

Since these two cowards were afraid, they would spare their lives.

Attacking two useless trash was an insult to their dignity as lions\!

They planned to tear this little elephant into pieces and swallow it in front of these bumpkins\!

But.

Just as they were walking towards the little elephant, a figure suddenly stood in front of them and blocked their path.

This was the little lion that did not even have a mane.

His size and weight were even inferior to that of a lioness\!

They were not even interested in looking at him previously.

When they were his age, be it their size or weight, they did not know how far away they were from him.

With his small body, he also dared to be a mantis trying to stop a chariot and overestimate his capabilities?

He was courting death\!

"Bang\!"

Just as the two wandering lions' gazes were disdainful and they were about to walk up and kill this little lion, a claw suddenly appeared in front of them\!

Then, the wandering lion on the left tilted its head and its mouth was filled with blood as it fell to the ground.

At the same time, two teeth flew out\!

Before the wandering lion on the right could react, its throat was suddenly bitten by two rows of sharp fangs\!

Even with the protection of a thick mane, the two rows of fangs still pierced through his skin and instantly pierced through his neck\!

He widened his eyes and opened his mouth. All his strength instantly disappeared and his body could not help but fall to the ground\!

At this moment, he saw the terrifying enemy in front of him clearly\!

He started to struggle with all his might.

However, the two rows of fangs that were biting his throat were like steel gears that locked his life door. They closed tightly, causing his strength and aura to instantly disintegrate.

He widened his eyes in fear and looked at his brother, hoping that he would save him.

However, his brother was lying on the ground with his mouth full of blood. He swayed his head and saw stars. His eyes were filled with confusion. Clearly, he had lost himself from the slap.

"Hey…"

He opened his mouth and wanted to roar like a lion, wanting to wake up his brother and his desperate self. However, he could only let out a weak sigh.

Then, his vision started to blur and gradually darken.

Then, it was dark.

He stared with his eyes wide open and stopped breathing completely.

"Roar—"

At this moment, his brother finally jumped up from the ground and let out an angry and terrifying roar\!

He bared his fangs and his face was distorted, looking ferocious and terrifying\!

Chu Xiaoye loosened his teeth and slowly raised his head to look at him.

"Roar—"

He let out an angry roar again, then suddenly turned around and fled into the distance\!

However, just as he ran a few meters away, a figure suddenly flashed behind him. It was like a breeze that fell on him, but it directly pushed him to the ground.

Before he could jump up from the ground, the two rows of sharp fangs that had killed his brother locked his neck tightly with a crack\!

He opened his mouth full of blood and his teeth fell out. He widened his eyes and looked at the terrifying enemy in front of him who did not even have a mane. He was terrified and in disbelief.

Not far away, the Chino brothers, the jackal couple, and even the little elephant were frozen in place, watching this scene in a daze.

This was the first time he had displayed his ferocity and terrifying strength to his own kind in front of them\!

He seemed to have grown up overnight.

A true lion was always so cold and cruel\!

He finally took this important step on his path to becoming a king.

From today onwards, their reverence for him would be like that of a true king.

This was their king\!

The corpses of the two wandering lions were abandoned on the green grassland. Under the morning sun, the miserable lives of the failures were written.

A snow-white goshawk circled in the sky for a while before flapping its wings and leaving, flying towards the snow mountain at the end of the distant grassland.

Two days later.

They finally saw the river that spanned the grassland.

The land here was even more fertile and the grass was even more lush. Trees and bushes were everywhere, and countless herbivores lingered.

This was the paradise of animals.

However, the competition here would be more cruel and bloody than elsewhere, frequent and fatal.

The grassland on both sides of the river was divided into territories of all sizes. Almost every inch of land had an owner.

There were very few wandering lions here, and most of them were killed. Only a small number of them would join the prides here, becoming kings or slaves.

There was a huge elephant herd nearby.

When Chu Xiaoye passed by with the little elephant, the thirty-plus elephants suddenly rushed towards them with thunder rumbling under the elephant's head\!

At that moment, the ground trembled and the sky changed color, as if the world was ending\!

The animals thousands of meters away fled in fear\!

The elephants here were even larger and terrifying. They were really like small mountains\!

When a group of small mountains surged over, who could resist them?

The Chino brothers almost peed their pants from fright. Their running speed was even faster than that of the two agile jackals.

However, the little elephant's speed was like a turtle crawling.

Or rather, it had never thought of escaping.

Elephants were generally very docile, kind, and friendly. Even if they encountered other herbivores in trouble, they would sometimes save them, let alone their own kind.

They chased after them with a murderous aura not to hurt the little elephant, of course, but to chase away the Chino brothers and save the little elephant.

They thought that the little elephant was being held hostage by the two lions and was preparing to eat it.

Therefore, when they caught up to the little elephant, they stopped.

A large group of huge fellows immediately surrounded the little elephant and lined up. They went forward one by one to comfort it with their noses. Then, they forcefully brought it away and let it join the elephant herd.

The little elephant looked back three times with every step, like a child that had been abducted by a bully. It was pitiful and helpless, but there was nothing it could do.

Chu Xiaoye stood in the distance and looked at its back with flickering eyes, silently watching it leave.

This was its best home.

It was an elephant, so how could it mix with ferocious carnivores like them?

When they were really hungry one day, they could not guarantee that they would not eat it.

Furthermore, if it followed, it would constantly attract the attacks of other carnivores.

They could barely take care of themselves, so how could they protect it?

Now, it had joined the super elephant herd. No one dared to provoke it on this grassland. It was much safer and more free than before.

"Elephant girl, congratulations. I hope you grow up healthily and become fatter\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her retreating figure and thought as he stood under the dim yellow sun.

The little elephant seemed to have sensed his thoughts and turned its head, shaking its nose at him.

It seemed to be saying, "Brother Fart, I'll bless you too. I hope you can become a king soon and dominate the grassland\! Get smellier and smellier\!"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the panting Chino brothers and the jackal couple. His heart suddenly jumped.

Where was Doya?

Previously, Doya had been riding on the little elephant's back when she was chased.

Could it be that she was brought away by the little elephant?

Impossible\!

The elephant herd did not allow a cub of a carnivore to mix in.

"Roar\!"

At this moment, Doya's childish and anxious cry suddenly came from the grass not far away.

It turned out that when the elephant herd was about to catch up to the little elephant, she immediately jumped down from the little elephant's back and ran by herself, then hid in the dense grass.

After the little elephant left, she could only rely on herself in the future.

If she could not keep up, Chu Xiaoye would not wait for her.

Doya knew that she had to be strong.

Only in this way could she continue to live with this young king.

Her gaze was determined as she ran over quickly.

At this moment, a cheetah suddenly jumped out from the grass not far away\!

The cheetah was extremely fast. Like a bolt of lightning, it rushed close in the blink of an eye\!

A cheetah was the fastest among all animals on land\!

When it soared into the sky and drew a perfect arc in the air, just as it was about to pounce on Doya, a faster figure suddenly jumped up and pounced on its side\!

"Bang\!"

The heavy collision made it lose its balance in the air. Its body with perfect lines flew out diagonally and fell to the ground in a sorry state. It rolled a few times before stopping.

It suddenly jumped up and looked incredulously at the young lion that had landed beside the female cub. Without any hesitation, it turned around and quickly fled the place.

It had just hidden in the grass and witnessed the scene of them being chased by elephants and escaping in a hurry.

It originally thought that they were already exhausted and with its speed, it could quickly rush to the cub's side, pick her up, and leave easily. However, it never would have thought that the young lion was even faster than it\!

Was that a lion?

It even became suspicious.

On this grassland, they were able to reproduce until now under the threat of all sorts of powerful enemies because of their incomparable speed.

Now, when it saw the young lion's speed, it immediately felt fear.

This was fear for the future.

Could it be that the world was about to change in this grassland?

"Boom —"

The world had indeed changed.

Thunder suddenly sounded and dark clouds quickly gathered.

The sky that had just been clear suddenly turned black.

The sun had yet to set when a storm arrived.

This surprised Chu Xiaoye, who had just arrived at this grassland and was used to the dry season.

How good would it be if this rain fell on the grassland over there?

It was a waste to land here.

There was nothing he really needed, but there were so many things he wished he could throw away.

Fairness was never there.

He could only rely on his own efforts\!

The rain poured down.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the hazy sky, turned around, and walked towards the forest not far away.

The rain poured on him, washing away the dust from running around and fighting all the way, but it could not wash away the fighting spirit and dreams in his heart.

The flames in his heart were still burning\!
