Chapter 440: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Belia pounced ferociously and was merciless\!

However, the jaguar was extremely fast. It dodged again, but did not counterattack. It continued to lie on the branch and beg for mercy.

Belia missed and seemed to be a little angry. She prepared to pounce on him again.

At this moment, Blue suddenly growled and stopped her. His figure flashed and he landed beside her. He looked solemnly at the jaguar that was begging for mercy.

From the few times this jaguar dodged just now, he could tell that his daughter was no match for this jaguar.

If this jaguar suddenly attacked, his daughter might even be in danger\!

Blue turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye.

Now that the pride had just arrived and were about to fight for territory, if they wanted to survive here, they had to continue expanding the team and strengthen the entire team.

This jaguar was not weak and was rather familiar with the environment here. It was a good choice.

Chu Xiaoye did not answer immediately. He jumped onto a branch two meters in front of the jaguar and sized it up carefully.

The jaguar seemed to have long realized that he was the king of this team, so it lowered its head and begged for mercy again. It let out a pitiful cry, indicating that it was willing to surrender and submit, hoping to survive.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked at the corpses of the jaguars that had fallen to the ground under the tree. He then looked at her again.

Seeing his gaze, the jaguar hurriedly lowered its body again, raised its tail, and wagged its butt. It had a fawning expression, indicating that if it joined the pride, not only could it help kill the enemy, it could also help raise offspring.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment, and his eyes revealed a hint of surprise. Then, he jumped gently and landed beside her, looking at her with a burning gaze.

"Are you sure you can even help to raise my offspring?"

The jaguar turned its head and swayed its butt with a fawning expression. "Of course you can. As long as you spare my life, I will definitely be loyal and serve you obediently, hunt for you, fight for you, and bear your children."

Chu Xiaoye grinned and raised his claws to place them on her head, stroking her gently. "Very good. Then…"

The jaguar lowered its head and narrowed its eyes, its face filled with enjoyment and gentleness.

Not far away, Belia was furious when she saw this scene. She roared angrily, "Shameless\! First come first served\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye's foot was gently stroking the leopard's head, he suddenly flicked his golden claw and instantly pierced through the fur on the jaguar's head and into her flesh\!

However, this jaguar's reaction speed was peerlessly fast\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw was about to pierce into her skull when she suddenly tilted her head. With a whoosh, Chu Xiaoye's golden claw immediately slid down the skull and grabbed a bloody piece of flesh\!

As for the jaguar, it jumped away at lightning speed and landed on another branch two meters away. Its head was dripping with blood.

The blood slid down her forehead to her eyes and face, making her look rather ferocious.

Her fawning face just now instantly distorted and terrifying\!

"Roar—"

The jaguar roared angrily and bared its sharp fangs, its eyes filled with hatred and anger.

"Why? I've already surrendered\! I've already agreed to submit to you\! I even want to become your wife and concubine and hunt and have children for you\! Why do you still want to kill me?"

She roared and questioned.

Not only was she not expecting this change, the other members of the pride were also shocked.

Especially Belia, who was full of jealousy. She widened her eyes in confusion.

They were still discussing about having kids just now. Why did he suddenly want to kill her?

Facing this jaguar's angry question, Chu Xiaoye did not answer immediately.

He raised his claws and hung the fur that he had grabbed from her head on the branch. Then, he raised his head and narrowed his eyes, looking at her teasingly.

"Do I look like a fool? I killed so many of your companions in front of you. Two of the male jaguars even had your scent on them. They should be your lovers, right? They probably just had sex with you last night, right? Do you think I will believe that you sincerely submit?"

The jaguar looked at him with hatred and pierced its sharp claws into the branch under him.

"Even if you sincerely submit, I don't dare to accept it. As for hunting and giving birth, it's nothing to me. Furthermore, my team already has two female leopards."

Chu Xiaoye's face was filled with ridicule as he started to secretly accumulate strength behind him.

Not far away, Belia's eyes immediately lit up. She was so excited that her entire body was trembling. She hurriedly let out a roar and wished she could immediately pounce on him and give him her delicate body.

"Your Majesty, Belita and I will always be your most loyal servants\! In the future, Belita will be in charge of hunting and I will be in charge of giving birth\! No matter when you want it, Belia will always lie in front of you first\!"

Belita, who was innocent, could only growl and weakly express her dissatisfaction.

She did not want to help that big smelly fart hunt anymore\!

From when she was young, the big smelly fart had been snatching her prey. Now that she had finally grown up, she did not want to be bullied by him again\!

"Roar—"

The jaguar suddenly roared angrily and jumped up\!

However, she was not angry from embarrassment and pounced at Chu Xiaoye. Instead, she suddenly jumped onto the branch above him and jumped towards the highest canopy at lightning speed, preparing to escape from the canopy.

However, there was already a figure guarding above her, flashing its cold silver claws.

When the jaguar jumped up again, the figure suddenly flew out of the dense leaves. With a whoosh, it suddenly grabbed her abdomen\!

The jaguar was shocked. At this critical moment, it actually twisted its body in midair and avoided its vitals, landing on a branch at the side.

Catherine's silver claws left a few long wounds on her abdomen\!

It was only a few millimeters away from penetrating her abdomen and touching her internal organs\!

The jaguar's stomach was cold and it was terrified. Seeing that it was surrounded in all directions and that its head and stomach were injured, it could only growl again to show that it was willing to submit.

This time, she was really willing to submit.

"Spare my life and I'm willing to be your servant for life\!"

However, Chu Xiaoye still did not give her any chance. He jumped up and swung his golden claws.

The jaguar roared angrily with a furious expression. It could only jump up again.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, another figure suddenly rushed out from the leaves above her head and suddenly pierced her neck\!

This time, the jaguar could not dodge and let out a miserable scream. With a bang, the figure grabbed its neck and pressed it heavily onto the branch.

"Wait\!"

Just as Alisa's sharp claws were about to pierce the jaguar's neck, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and suddenly pierced the jaguar's head with his claws, giving her a fatal blow\!
