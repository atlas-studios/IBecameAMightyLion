Chapter 302: Golden Claw and Silver Claw

"Whoosh\!"

Before she could land, the golden figure had already rushed over with lightning speed and smashed her head again\!

Tilly was in midair, but she suddenly twisted her body. Not only did she dodge this fatal punch, she also stepped on his fist and flew out, landing seven to eight meters away.

She did not hesitate and immediately limped towards the path.

She was naturally much slower.

How could the young lion king, whose face had been pierced, let her go? With a whoosh, he rushed up and jumped. Like a goshawk, he swooped down quickly at his target\!

Tilly limped and could not escape.

At this moment, a black shadow suddenly rushed out from the side. With a whoosh, it pounced at the furious lion king.

Silver light flashed and cold air rushed towards his abdomen\!

Haas could only give up on attacking. He turned around and punched the silver claw heavily with a bang.

However, he did not touch any force.

Catherine's attack was clearly a bluff. She only wanted to save Tilly, so she only acted fierce.

Then, she quickly retreated.

Hence, Haas' heavy punch seemed to have hit the air.

Catherine landed on the ground and got up. She protected Tilly and ran back the way they came.

Tilly looked back at her and grinned at her to show her gratitude. She stuck out her tongue again to show that although she was very grateful, she could forget about making her reward her.

The little white lion that had its leg broken and almost lost its life just now actually had the mood to joke at this moment.

"Whoosh\!"

The furious young lion king pounced forward again.

Catherine could not dodge and could only jump up and swing her silver claws to face it\!

"Bang\!"

Fists and claws collided\!

Catherine was sent flying and landed on the ground, her entire body numb.

As for the furious young lion king, it fell to the ground and could not help but take a few steps back.

He seemed to be a little surprised by the strength of this female cub.

His killing intent was even stronger\!

Behind him, the roars of the four guards and the other lions could be heard.

"Whooshâ€”"

Haas roared and rushed up again.

He had to kill these two female lions before his subordinates arrived. Otherwise, it was difficult to explain his hysterical roar previously.

He needed to use the blood of these two female lions to dye his lion's mane red\!

He was also very fast and arrived in the blink of an eye\!

Tilly limped and jumped as she ran.

Catherine protected her from behind and fought the young lion king again. Her silver claws flashed like a meteor\!

"Chi\!"

Her claws grabbed the lion king's head\!

However, before she could penetrate his fur, a fist suddenly enlarged in her eyes.

"Bang\!"

Catherine flew out and hit Tilly, who was limping ahead.

Hence, the two female cubs fell onto the grass together.

Haas did not hesitate and pounced forward, revealing his ferocious fangs and a pair of black, sharp claws that were like sickles\!

His feet were very big, like the palms of chimpanzees. He had five thick fingers that were like fingers, and the sharp claws on them could actually shrink and bounce out at will\!

At this moment, he was going to use these two strange and cold claws to completely tear apart the delicate bodies of these two female cubs\!

Just as he jumped up and pounced at them, the two female lions suddenly jumped up with a whoosh. However, they did not escape or dodge. Instead, they pounced at him together\!

Golden claws and silver claws shot towards him like two bolts of lightning\!

One grabbed towards his eyes, and the other grabbed towards his abdomen\!

Haas' claws could completely pierce into the heads of the two female lions first, but the other party's claws might also pierce into his body\!

The wounds on his eyes and abdomen were not so easy to heal.

These two female cubs were clearly fighting with their lives on the line, not caring about their own lives at all. They wanted to use their lives to seriously injure him.

They seemed to be wanting to give another killer a chance.

Haas hesitated for a moment and slightly changed his direction and speed. He was vigilant of the other movements around him and his sharp claws still grabbed at the two female lions.

However, this moment alone gave Catherine and Tilly a chance to dodge.

The two female lions tacitly dispelled the force of their pounce. Before they landed, they quickly turned around. As soon as they landed, they jumped up like two agile antelopes and ran forward together.

Just like before, they were still bluffing.

It was their first time fighting side by side and they were already so tacit that even they were surprised.

Tilly's broken front leg actually healed automatically and she was no longer limping\!

However, they still underestimated the young lion king's true strength.

The moment they turned around and jumped away, Haas had already jumped up again and pounced forward\!

His jump made him seem to be flying in the sky. He flew more than ten meters and instantly passed above Tilly and Catherine's heads, landing in front of them.

"Bang\! Bang\!"

He turned around and punched Tilly and Catherine's heads as quickly as lightning\!

Before the two female lions could react, they were sent flying and fell to the ground in a sorry state.

If these two punches landed on the head of an ordinary lioness, her skull would definitely shatter and she would die.

However, Catherine and Tilly only felt dizzy and their minds were buzzing. They struggled for a moment on the ground and got up again.

However, they could not escape.

The front path was blocked by this terrifying young lion king, and the other lions behind had already caught up.

They were only twenty meters away from the border.

This small distance was the distance between life and death, but it seemed to be difficult for them to cross it again.

His mind was still buzzing and his body was a little shaky.

Tilly blinked and swayed a few times, wanting to lie down and sleep for a while.

Catherine suddenly jumped up and pounced at the lion king.

Haas' gaze turned cold as he flicked his sharp claws. Just as he was about to tear this overconfident lioness cub into pieces, he suddenly felt that something was wrong. His body rolled to the side with a whoosh\!

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly streaked across the place where he had just stood\!

Before Catherine could land, a figure hit her, but it did not have any strength. It brought her down gently in front of Tilly.

Catherine lay on the ground with her legs facing the sky.

Chu Xiaoye spread his four legs and stood on her, but he looked at Tilly and asked in concern, "Are you okay?"

Tilly let out another grunt that only a human girl was qualified to make. She turned her head and ignored him.

Chu Xiaoye got down from Catherine and looked at the lions that had already run close. He turned around and looked at the golden-haired lion king.

Catherine was still lying on the ground with her four legs facing the sky. She did not move and would turn into a stone sculpture.

Only when Tilly kicked her butt did she wake up. She turned around and got up, but she lowered her head. Her dark eyes and long eyelashes were like stamens in the wind, trembling slightly and dodging shyly.

"Look at you\!"

Tilly rolled her eyes in disdain.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail ran over with the pride.
