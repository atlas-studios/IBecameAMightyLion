Chapter 325: Leave No One alive\!

Survival was the most important.

However, clearly, the little white lion did not seem to understand this principle. It would rather starve to death than touch the lion head.

Chu Xiaoye could only bring the internal organs of the black lion over and hang them in front of her. They swayed in the wind, dripping with blood, and leaned closely against the lion head.

The lion under the tree looked up at this scene and felt his blood run cold, shocked, and angry.

Tilly still would rather die than eat.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and ate the remaining lion's body clean.

Hot air flowed in his body and his strength quickly recovered.

He lay on the highest branch and narrowed his eyes to rest.

Catherine lay on the branch below him and closed her eyes too.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei took the time to recover their strength.

Only Tilly was still roaring angrily and resentfully.

The thirty-over lions under the tree were clearly impatient from waiting.

They did not have the patience of those spotted hyenas to surround the prey on the tree.

Furthermore, they were not doing this for prey.

If he did not enjoy life, why did he have to stay here and suffer and be afraid?

Hence, when one of the lions got up and left, the other lions also got up and turned to leave.

Before long, the thirty-over lions left completely.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and was a little stunned. He was giving up just like that?

However, he did not go down immediately.

In the evening, everyone had recovered most of their strength. He was the first to jump down and look around before letting Little Curly Tail and the others come down.

When they came to the place where the black lion king fell yesterday, they did not see the lion king's corpse.

There was still a pool of blood on the ground. Other than that, there was nothing else.

Chu Xiaoye's heart tightened and he was secretly surprised. Could it be that the black lion king was not dead?

"A broken head is a broken head, and death is a different matter."

He suddenly thought of the scene of the cold father coming back to life.

Then, when it was switched to this black lion king, it was: "Opening the stomach is opening the stomach, and death is death. Who says that if the stomach is broken and the intestines flow out, you will definitely die?"

For the various mutants that had appeared during this period of time, this was really a possibility.

No one knew what skills every mutant had and how many skills they had.

Just like him, the dignified young, handsome, and powerful lion king's most powerful skill was actually farting and drooling. Who would have thought that he would steal other people's skills?

"Steal other people's skills?"

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled.

Back then, when he completely killed the golden-haired lion king, he stole its skill to quickly heal its wounds. And yesterday, if he really killed the black lion king, he should have stolen one of its skills.

However, he did not obtain anything.

In other words, the black lion king might not be completely dead\!

At the thought of this, he was shocked.

If the black lion king was really not dead, with the other party's hatred for them and the black lions here, the other party might enter the grassland again and kill everywhere.

With the strength of the black lion king, as long as he did not encounter a pride with up to 100 lions at once, he would definitely be strong and invincible. He would kill every pride on the grassland bit by bit.

Therefore, he had to kill the black lion king completely to prevent future trouble\!

Now, even if the black lion king was not dead, it was definitely seriously injured and did not have the combat strength at its peak. If it lost this opportunity, it would be too late to regret.

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye stopped hesitating and immediately brought Little Curly Tail and the others towards the forest in front.

When those lions left, they all entered the forest, and their scent was still lingering on the way.

Suddenly, they heard a commotion.

Chu Xiaoye looked up, his eyes flickering with two golden lights. He passed through the forest and looked ahead.

A few strong black figures were chasing a strong antelope.

Soon, the antelope was pushed to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye immediately ran over with Little Curly Tail and the others.

"Roar—"

It was a group of black female lions, a total of seven.

When they saw them appear, the seven female lions bared their fangs. They were shocked and flustered, looking a little at a loss.

They had clearly not seen any foreign species for a long time.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment, immediately growled, and was the first to rush up.

This was not the time to feel pity\!

Why did those black lionesses not show mercy when they slaughtered the female lions and young cubs of the grassland?

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

He directly crushed the head of a black lioness that had yet to react\!

Little Curly Tail followed closely and suddenly swung his tail, shattering the spines of the two black lionesses. They fell to the ground and could not get up again.

Catherine pounced forward and swung her silver claws. Blood splashed and her stomach was cut open\!

Mei Mei rushed up and her light blue claws pierced into the bodies of the black female lions.

Tilly was hungry and thirsty. She actually bit the neck of a female lion and started to suck blood.

In less than a moment, the seven black female lions all fell into a pool of blood. They did not even have the time to let out a scream.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the limp antelope. Just as he was about to lower his head and bite it, Tilly suddenly jumped over, grabbed the antelope in her mouth, ran to the side, and started eating.

She was the only one who did not eat just now.

Now that he saw the delicious and tender antelope, he naturally had to eat heartily and fill his stomach.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at Catherine and gestured for her to eat too.

The female cub was the most injured. No one knew if she had recovered completely. She had only eaten one lion leg just now and was clearly not full.

Catherine looked at Tilly but lowered her head. She did not go over to show that she was not hungry.

Tilly raised her head and called out to Mei Mei, signaling her to come and enjoy it together.

Mei Mei turned to look at Chu Xiaoye. After her brother nodded, she ran over happily.

Little Curly Tail curled his mouth to express his dissatisfaction, but he did not mind. He walked in front of a black lioness and started to eat with relish.

To him, as long as he could fill his stomach, he would eat even the flesh of his own kind.

In the past, when the dry season was at its most difficult, after his brother left, he even brought everyone to eat a meal of rotten meat.

That feeling was still unforgettable.

However, if he was given another chance, he would still eat it.

To him, survival and being able to fight side by side with his brother were the most important.

Chu Xiaoye saw that Tilly and Mei Mei were eating with relish and felt hungry again. He could only walk in front of a black lioness and lower his head to eat.

Now was not the time to choose food. He had to eat his fill as soon as possible so that he could kill the black lion king.

He looked up at Catherine and gestured for her to eat quickly.

Catherine hesitated for a moment, lowered her head, and walked in front of him. She got up and ate the black lioness on the ground with him.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He meant for this female cub to eat other black female lions. This one was not enough for him to eat alone.

Forget it, let her have it.

Chu Xiaoye got up, walked in front of another black lioness, and started eating.

Catherine looked up at him and immediately came to a realization. She immediately lowered her head and looked at a loss.

Soon, everyone was full.

Chu Xiaoye brought them and continued forward.

Before long, Chu Xiaoye suddenly smelled a pungent smell from the ground.

This was the smell of a lion marking its territory.

It seemed that the lions did not live together. They were still like ordinary prides, having their own territories and prides.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and walked in.

"Roar—"

Soon, an angry roar came from afar.

Then, two strong black lions flew over with their manes flying.

They thought that it was a pride of lions next door that was chasing their prey and trespassing their territory.

When they saw Chu Xiaoye and the others, they were clearly stunned. Then, the two black lions seemed to have recognized them and hurriedly turned around and fled.

These two black lions were two of the thirty-over black lions from before.

They thought that these young fellows would immediately flee in panic after being taught a lesson. Who knew that these few fellows would actually return to find them\!

They clearly remembered how terrifying the young kid with a circle of golden mane was. He instantly killed one of their companions and opened his stomach in front of them to eat.

Therefore, as soon as they recognized each other, they turned around and fled.

They fled to their camp, hoping to get the help of the female lions.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others and followed closely. He wanted to find the black lion king. Even if he did not find the other party, he would not let go of any black lion here.

If he did not eliminate the roots, it would grow again when the spring breeze blew\!

He did not want the grassland that he had fought so hard to return to be trampled by these black lions again\!

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

When they caught up to a forest, the two black lions immediately stopped in their tracks and turned around. They bared their fangs at them, revealed a fierce expression, and roared angrily.

At the same time, a group of black female lions ran out of the bushes. They bared their fangs and roared ferociously.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in front of them and looked behind them. In the bushes, a few small furry heads popped out and trembled. Their young faces and eyes were filled with fear, looking very much like the former them.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not have any mercy.

He rushed up.

Little Curly Tail did not hesitate and wagged his tail with a murderous aura\!

Mei Mei, Tilly, and Catherine recovered to their peak states and shot out\!

To this group of lions, who had lived comfortably and had not fought outside for a long time, they were like sharp steel blades. When they raised and fell, they were corpses.

The two tall and strong lions only had appearances and were not as strong as the female lions. As soon as they fought, their heads were cut off by Chu Xiaoye and Tilly.

Catherine rushed towards the female lions, swung her silver claws, and opened her stomach without mercy\!

Soon, the adult lions in this pride all fell to the ground and turned into mangled corpses.

As for the young cubs, they hid in the bushes and shivered. They did not dare to come out or escape. They could only stare with terrified eyes and wait for fate to make arrangements.

Chu Xiaoye stood outside the bushes, his claws covered in blood. He looked at the clear and terrified eyes and his heart twitched unconsciously.

"Whoosh\!"

Before he could attack, Catherine had already taken the lead and rushed over. She waved her silver claws and in a moment, she killed all the cubs hiding inside, not leaving a single one alive\!

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and looked blankly at the young corpses all over the ground. He slowly retracted his claws.

Catherine was covered in blood. She lowered her head and walked out of the bushes. She stood behind him silently, not daring to look at him.

Chu Xiaoye seemed to sigh in relief. He retracted his gaze and looked in front of him before turning to leave.

Mei Mei looked at the corpses of the cubs, then turned around and looked at Catherine, who was covered in blood. She suddenly felt that this lioness cub that she had grown up with grew further and further away, becoming colder and stranger.

Even she found it difficult to approach.

Sometimes, she even felt that this lioness cub that had been picked up did not seem to be alive. Instead, she was like a tool of her brother that would always stand behind him. No matter what her brother wanted to do, she would be the first to rush up, as if she would never have her own thoughts or decisions.

In the past, she thought that this lioness cub would become their friend or even family.

However, now, she felt that this female cub was like something on her brother. It was cold and dark. There were no feelings or emotions. No one could approach her.

Except for his brother.

Little Curly Tail had the same feeling as her.

However, Little Curly Tail had always felt that this lioness cub was not to be trifled with.

Now that he saw that the other party was so fierce, cold, and ruthless, he was even more afraid.

"Women are not to be trifled with\!"

This was the conclusion Little Curly Tail had reached after growing up.

Therefore, he decided to stay far away from all the female lions in the future. He only needed to follow his brother.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front and secretly hated himself for being soft-hearted just now. At that moment, he almost subconsciously felt that he could not bear to do so.

He decided that he had to abandon any unnecessary feelings next.

For the sake of that beautiful grassland and his companions who worshipped him as king, he had to have the ruthlessness and decisiveness a lion king should have.

Catherine lowered her head and followed behind him. She was almost in sync with his footsteps and looked like his shadow.

The sun shone into the forest and landed on the two of them, making them look so tacit and harmonious, as if they were naturally growing together.

"Whoosh\!"

A snow-white figure suddenly pierced into their middle. It pushed Chu Xiaoye's head and made him stumble a few steps forward.

Tilly and Catherine walked side by side, wagging their tails and touching her tail. They raised their claws and rubbed her head, looking like close sisters.
