Chapter 424: Untitled

"Roar—"

In order to increase his dignity and dominance, the cold father let out a roar filled with male strength as he walked forward. His lush mane made him look even more mighty and strong\!

Many male animals would try their best to please the opposite sex and fawn on them to mate.

A lion was different.

They were very direct. As long as they displayed their powerful strength and rode on them forcefully, the female lions would naturally submit and not dare to resist.

At this moment, the cold father walked as if he was invincible and walked majestically in front of the young lioness. He looked down at her.

Domineering\!

"Bang\!"

The cold father flew out and his dominance was revealed.

Alisa sent him flying with a slap and hung on the tree at the side, swaying like a seaweed.

Chu Xiaoye, who was on the tree, looked down and secretly mourned for his lecherous father.

Of all people, why did you provoke this lioness?

Even if you provoke that… Little Mi.

Chu Xiaoye thought carefully. This fellow could only provoke Little Mi. The other members were not easy to bully.

Thinking about it, this father lived quite sadly.

When they were young, this father had always been a protector and an extremely powerful existence in their eyes. As long as he was here, they were not afraid.

Thinking of the kindness he had shown when he was young, Chu Xiaoye felt a little unbearable. He immediately climbed down the tree and jumped onto the branch the cold father hung, looking down at him.

The cold father also looked at him and was trembling.

The cold father hated climbing trees and hated being slapped to death.

His lifelong reputation was ruined.

That damn lioness almost broke his bones. She was not to be trifled with.

"Unfilial son\! Put me down\!"

The cold father glared at Chu Xiaoye angrily, feeling embarrassed.

Chu Xiaoye walked to another branch and raised his claws, slapping the branch heavily with a bang.

"Crack\!"

The branch broke.

The cold father fell down and fell heavily to the ground.

Fortunately, it was not high. Furthermore, the cold father's bones were extraordinary, so he was not injured.

However, this was a great humiliation.

The cold father could not tolerate it. He roared angrily and rushed towards the young lioness. He suddenly jumped over her and pounced on a big tree behind her. As he roared, he scratched with all his might, looking extremely fierce\!

Soon, the pitiful little tree's bark fell off and its leaves fluttered. It was riddled with wounds and on the verge of collapse.

After the cold father vented, he lay on the ground and buried his head in the grass, not moving.

Mei Mei walked over, lowered her head, and rubbed his head gently. She comforted him gently, as if she was saying, "Father, don't be dejected. You can definitely find a lioness who loves you."

The cold father slowly raised his head and rubbed his head in response for the first time. "My little cotton-padded jacket is still the most considerate and filial. Those two unfilial sons…"

Little Curly Tail walked to his side and started wagging his tail, looking at him with narrowed eyes.

The cold father buried his head in the grass again and did not move.

Little Curly Tail grinned and his eyes were filled with disdain. He turned around and left, sneering inwardly. What's so good about female lions? They're annoying to look at\! Look at my Brother Tail, he's disdainful of female lions\!

At this moment, he suddenly saw Molly crawl out of the bushes and sneak into the forest not far away.

"This female cub wants to pee secretly again\! She actually dared to pee without my permission\! She's asking for a beating\!"

"Whoosh—"

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and immediately chased after her.

Mei Mei looked at him with disdain. He even cared about Molly peeing. He was really domineering.

Aisha, Xi'er, and Maya walked over and lay beside the cold father, comforting him silently.

They had experienced life and death, been separated and reunited, and experienced all sorts of suffering. They had fought side by side, been intimate with each other, and had once fled together. Now that their intelligence had increased, they cherished each other.

Even if the cold father was no longer the king of this pride, even if his strength did not seem to be much here, they would always be the same to him.

The cold father raised his head and looked at the three of them. He seemed to be sighing, but it was difficult to express and he was too ashamed to express it.

He was not touched, grateful, or enlightened.

He was sad.

He was tired of it.

He was already tired of these three female lions.

He wanted to mate with younger and more beautiful lionesses\!

"Scum\!"

In Chu Xiaoye's eyes, this father was a fellow who was not worthy of sympathy.

He was still not satisfied despite having so many wives. He was still half-hearted and had designs on other female lions. If this was not a scummy lion, what was?

Fortunately, he did not inherit this fellow's scum lion genes.

Furthermore, his ambition was not here.

"Roar…"

The female leopard, Belia, came again and started to perform her graceful dance with all her might, looking like she had just escaped from a mental hospital.

Belita hid in the bushes and looked shyly at her exaggerated and comical actions. She felt that her sister was so embarrassing.

The Jiela sisters and the other female lions looked up from afar. They were already shocked and puzzled by this female leopard's actions at first. They became calm and even vaguely looked forward to it.

If this female leopard succeeded, they might have a chance too.

Catherine lay quietly in the grass on the other side, her heart calm.

No matter what choice he made, she would support him silently.

However, in her heart, only that noble little white lion was worthy of him.

The little girl sat under the tree and curled up. She looked up, her big eyes filled with curiosity.

Perhaps humans were smart to begin with, or perhaps she had seen it on television before. She immediately understood the intentions of the female leopard.

She felt that if lions mated with leopards, it would definitely be interesting.

Alisa also raised her head and was paying close attention to the tree, thinking about how to chase that kid down from the throne and replace him.

If she was a lion, it would be much easier.

Since ancient times, female lions had the lowest status in the pride and did not have a precedent of becoming lion kings.

It was naturally not so easy for her to be the first.

Furthermore, until now, she had yet to see that fellow's true strength. She could not be sure if she was really stronger than him.

She could only wait patiently.

She believed that she could definitely find a chance\!

The rain did not stop and the night was blurry.

The members of the pride had their own thoughts and did not sleep.

Belia's hard work did not get any response from Chu Xiaoye, but it attracted the gaze of a nightwalker hiding in the darkness.

"That's strong\!"

His eyes lit up and saliva flowed from the corner of his mouth.
