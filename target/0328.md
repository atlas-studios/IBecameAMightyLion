Chapter 328: Lions Riding Old Turtle

"Boom\!"

The lake water churned and sand and rocks flew.

The huge black python could not break free. In fear, it lowered its head and crawled into the bottom of the lake, twisting and shaking crazily. Countless sand, rocks, and mud fluttered around\!

Every time it was about to turn around to save its tail, the old turtle would swing its head and straighten its bent body. Then, it would continue to chew and eat slowly.

The huge black python was in pain and afraid. It used all sorts of methods, but it was useless.

In the end, he actually lay limp and deliberately pretended to be dead, hoping that this old turtle could relax its vigilance and let go of its mouth.

In the end, not only did it not get what it wanted, Little Curly Tail, who was wrapped around it, also got a chance to break open its stomach with a claw\!

The black python immediately rolled on the ground in pain, no longer having the strength to keep tossing and turning.

Little Curly Tail took this opportunity to turn around and slip away. Under Chu Xiaoye's signal, he immediately floated to the lake and swam ashore in a panic.

He could not stay in the water for too long. If he did not leave soon, he would probably suffocate to death.

After returning to the shore, he saw that everyone was waiting anxiously on the shore. When they saw him coming up, they surrounded him with worried expressions. Little Curly Tail was extremely touched. Just as he was about to express that he was fine, he saw Mei Mei growl.

"Where's Brother?"

Catherine also looked at him anxiously.

As for the little white lion, it stared at him, looking like it wanted to beat him up.

Little Curly Tail's face immediately stiffened. Then, he grinned and rolled his eyes, looking at them mockingly.

"What's the hurry? I'm riding a turtle down there\! I'd rather play with turtles than play with you guys\! In the future, stop being so cold and sticking to my hot butt\! I don't care about you guys\!"

Little Curly Tail raised his claws and touched his face with a proud expression.

"Brother only wants his brother\!"

At the bottom of the lake.

The huge black python was completely limp and on the verge of death.

The old turtle was still eating slowly.

The churning lake gradually returned to calm.

Chu Xiaoye put away his claws. Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly realized that there was a light at the bottom of the lake where the old turtle was lying just now. Then, it gradually disappeared.

He hesitated for a moment, but still swam over.

After landing, he realized that there was a surging water stream there. It was actually a spring. The water that spewed out carried a hot temperature.

Beside the spring lay a pure white shell.

The light just now seemed to have come from this shell.

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and patted the shell. He felt that although this thing was beautiful, it was useless to lions.

Even if there were treasures inside, they were useless.

He did not care for it at all.

Half of the giant black python's body had already been eaten by the old turtle.

Chu Xiaoye was afraid that the old turtle would suddenly return after eating and crush him to death. He did not dare to stay any longer and immediately bit the shell and swam up.

When they surfaced, the sky was almost bright.

Mei Mei, who was waiting anxiously on the shore, immediately jumped up happily when she saw him finally coming out.

Catherine stood silently at the side and stared at him intently.

As for Tilly, she was vomiting after Little Curly Tail. She did not know how that kid disgusted her.

Chu Xiaoye bit the shell and went ashore. He threw the shell on the stone on the ground and raised his claws, shattering its shell with a bang.

"Whoosh\!"

A light suddenly lit up from inside and then slowly extinguished.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it and saw that it was a pearl the size of a longan. He saw that its surface was as smooth as jade and crystalline. Seven-colored light flowed faintly from it, flickering and extinguishing at times, as if it was breathing. It looked extremely beautiful.

Mei Mei and Catherine looked at it in shock, not knowing what it was.

Tilly and Little Curly Tail also ran over and watched curiously with surprised expressions.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and touched the pearl gently. However, he saw that the light inside immediately extinguished and did not light up again.

After a long time, it slowly lit up again and continued to flicker rhythmically.

Chu Xiaoye touched it with his claws again. The pearl immediately extinguished the light like a living thing and lay there quietly without any movement.

Little Curly Tail felt a little bored. He extended his claws and dug out the meat in the shell. Then, he placed it in his mouth and started eating.

Mei Mei, Catherine, and Tilly widened their eyes and looked at the pearl that would light up without moving. Their faces revealed unconcealable love.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the three female lions and sighed secretly. Be it humans or animals, as long as they were female, they could not help but like these strange rocks.

It was just a stone. Was it necessary?

This pearl was clearly the beneficiary of the blood rain. Its body had become crystalline and a seven-colored heart had actually condensed in it. Perhaps, after a while, it might suddenly give birth to life.

However, it was useless to them.

Chu Xiaoye pushed with his claws and the pearls rolled on the ground.

He looked at the three female lions in front of him and pushed the pearl into the lake, looking like he was about to throw it away.

"Roar\!"

Mei Mei immediately called out. She twisted her butt and looked at him fawningly, as if she was begging, "Brother, I want…"

Catherine was much more reserved. She stared at the pearl in silence.

As for Tilly, her eyes lit up as she ran with the pearl. She jumped around and winked, looking very excited.

However, they never thought that even if they obtained this pearl, where could they put it?

They had no pockets at all.

However, since they liked it, they should keep it.

Chu Xiaoye walked over, put the pearl in his mouth, and turned to walk into the forest.

Mei Mei hurriedly followed behind him and rubbed her head against his body. She was about to lick his butt when he mercilessly kicked her to the ground.

Catherine followed behind him silently and lowered her head to hide the love in her eyes.

There was only one person she could love forever.

Tilly leaned over and raised her head and stuck out her chest. She walked beside him and peeked at his mouth with her eyes slanted. Her eyes rolled as if she was thinking of a scheme.

"Ugh —"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stopped in his tracks, tilted his head, and vomited at the grass beside him.

Tilly and Mei Mei were shocked. They hurriedly ran to his vomit and looked at his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth, but it was already empty.

Tilly and Mei Mei's expressions immediately changed as they looked at the vomit on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left. After taking a few steps, he turned around and roared at Mei Mei, telling her to follow quickly and stop looking.

Mei Mei followed with a disappointed expression.

As for Tilly, she was still standing there, staring intently at the pool of vomit.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei away. After walking into the distance, he suddenly turned around and quietly returned. He hid in a lush busha lush bushes and looked outside.

Under the moonlight, Tilly stared at the pool of vomit for a while, then turned around and looked in the direction they left in. Then, like a thief, she looked around and quickly extended her snow-white claws to dig in the vomit.

However, when she turned over all the vomit, she still did not find the pearl.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye, who was hiding in the bushes, turned around and opened his mouth at Mei Mei and Catherine, revealing the crystal clear pearl inside.

The two female lions were stunned.
