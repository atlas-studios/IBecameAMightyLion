Chapter 257: A Lion Fighting a Bull\!

At dawn.

Chu Xiaoye finally treated every member of the pride of the cold father.

The mixed fur lion king and the others lay in the bushes to rest.

The journey exhausted them.

Belita brought her sister into the depths of the bushes and went to the tree to dig out eggs to eat.

When the warthog saw Chu Xiaoye for the first time, it did not recognize him. Then, it smelled a familiar scent and happily followed behind Chu Xiaoye, humming to express its loyalty and longing.

Chu Xiaoye was the one who made the decision not to eat him back then.

As for the two young cubs, Nunu and Qiqi had clearly forgotten about him. They seemed to be careful and did not dare to approach.

When the morning sun rose, Chu Xiaoye climbed up the Baobab tree.

The Baobab tree was already lush and grew even thicker.

The tree hole that was collecting water had already closed and a large tumor quickly grew out.

During the rainy season, it needed to continue accumulating water and make sufficient preparations to wait for the dry season to arrive.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei did the right thing and did not continue to get water from here.

The river at the foot of the hill had plenty of water and they could drink as much as they wanted.

The water here had to be used again during the dry season.

However, there was no need for that now.

After everyone recovered, he would leave with them and go to the grassland that would never have a dry season to build a new pride.

The three storage rooms on the tree were still intact.

The dense leaves covered their outline. The thick branches carried their weight and became even more secure and hidden.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up to take a look. The food in the three storage rooms had been eaten clean and there was nothing left.

Obviously, the pride of the cold father had an exceptionally difficult time during the dry season.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail climbed up and said to him excitedly, "From today onwards, we can store prey again\!"

His brother was back. He was full of energy.

When his brother was not around, he did not have the energy to do anything.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him and did not tell him about migrating for the time being. He did not know how to express it.

They would no longer need anything here.

And this home, these two Baobab trees, would become a thing of the past.

He was a little unwilling, but he did not want to leave.

Be it life or lion life, he should move forward in a better direction every day and not stay in place and miss the beautiful scenery of the past.

Because this world was changing at all times.

If you did not change, you could only be eliminated.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the storage room and soon fell asleep.

Little Curly Tail knew that his brother was very tired and did not disturb him anymore. He lay on the branch beside him and closed his eyes.

Mei Mei lay beside her mother, paying attention to her injuries.

Catherine was still crawling in the bushes and looking up at the tree, but she could not see the figure anymore. She could only think of his appearance and closed her eyes.

Everything changed.

However, at this moment, nothing seemed to have changed.

Just like when she was young, she was at ease and happy.

Seeing that everyone was resting, Tilly quietly crawled into the bushes at the back and started to jump around in the forest to let herself go.

She was suffocated.

In order to maintain her noble image as a young lady, she had been holding it in.

She jumped to the orchard and saw the leopard sisters secretly eating bird eggs on the tree. Their mouths were full of egg liquid and bird fur, and above them, the angry cries of two birds were heard.

Tilly was also hungry.

She immediately jumped over and landed beside the two little leopards.

The Belita sisters were shocked and hurriedly raised their heads. When they saw that it was her, they heaved a sigh of relief and looked at her in confusion.

Could lions also eat eggs?

Tilly did not stand on ceremony and immediately pushed the sisters away. She lowered her head and reached into the huge nest, but she licked her mouth full of eggshells and bird fur.

All the eggs had been eaten.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

Belia laughed.

Tilly turned around and glared at her, immediately scaring her into silence.

Belita was afraid that they would fight. She hurriedly raised her claws and pointed at another fruit tree not far away.

There was also a bird's nest on that tree.

When Tilly saw this, she immediately jumped over and quickly climbed up the branch.

However, just as she stuck her head into the huge nest, there was a sudden hiss and a green snake head was revealed\!

A thin green snake was coiled in the bird's nest, opening its mouth and hissing threateningly at her.

There was still one egg left in the nest.

Tilly looked at the green snake and was stunned for a few seconds. Then, she let out a terrified scream and almost fell from the tree in fright\!

She jumped up and landed on a branch at the side. Then, with a whoosh, she jumped back to the big tree from before and quickly hid behind the Belita sisters. Her face was filled with fear, and she was trembling, almost crying.

She was not even afraid of sea pythons or crocodiles. She was only afraid of bright-colored snakes.

Back then, one of her brothers was bitten by this small snake and immediately fell to the ground, never to stand up again.

There was also a childhood playmate who drank a few mouthfuls of water in the primitive forest behind the snow mountain. In the end, he suddenly suffocated to death a few months later. Then, a thin red snake crawled out of his mouth.

From then on, she was extremely afraid of these things.

Fortunately, the temperature in their snow mountain was too low and there were no such terrifying little things.

Every time she came out of the snow mountain and came to this grassland and forest, she would be very careful to stay away from these things.

At this moment, she almost peed her pants when she suddenly saw this green snake\!

When the Belita sisters saw that this always overbearing and powerful little white lion was actually frightened by a small snake, they both wanted to laugh but did not dare to.

Belita let out a roar and immediately jumped up and landed on the tree. She climbed up to the nest and suddenly slapped the little snake's head, causing it to faint.

Then, under Tilly's terrified gaze, she bit the small snake into her mouth and ate with relish.

Her sister, Belia, also looked at her in shock.

This thing could be eaten?

As Belita ate, she glanced at them proudly.

During the dry season, when food was scarce, not only did she and her mother eat many small snakes, they also did not let go of rats and lizards. They could even eat some small insects with relish\!

"It's delicious\! Do you want to have a bite too?"

Seeing that they looked like bumpkins who had never seen the world, Belita was very pleased. As she ate the small snake that was wagging its tail violently, she suddenly jumped back and landed in front of them with a bang.

The little green snake's wagging tail happened to hit Tilly's face.

Tilly's body immediately stiffened and her eyes rolled back. She actually fainted from fright.

Fortunately, Belia, who was beside her, was quick to react. She bit the fur on her neck and hung her on a branch.

Seeing that she had gotten into trouble, Belita hurriedly swallowed the remaining little green snake into her stomach without leaving anything behind. She even burped to show that she still wanted to eat.

At this moment, even Belia looked at her with fear.

If this little girl was hungry, would she eat her too?

A day passed in the blink of an eye.

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye woke up from the storage room and stood on the tall and lush Baobab tree, looking at the river at the foot of the hill.

Many animals that needed to drink water were gathered there.

The ferocious underwater killer crocodile also returned to the river.

The members of the pride of the cold father were all injured. The hunting mission naturally landed on him.

To the current him, catching prey was naturally easy.

However, the pride now was not the original pride. Just the six huge lions needed a lot of prey.

Of course, he could not hunt for them personally.

With their abilities, they did not need him to do it personally.

Chu Xiaoye climbed down the Baobab tree and woke up the mixed fur, blue eyes, and the other lions. He brought them and walked majestically towards the river at the foot of the hill.

The corpse last night attracted many carnivores.

After a day of cleaning, the bloody grassland returned to normal.

At this moment, all sorts of carnivores must have gathered by the river, waiting to drink water.

However, in front of a group of lions, those little things were not worth mentioning.

At the foot of the hill, the cries of hyenas and the noise of various animals could be heard.

A group of water buffaloes had finished drinking water and were walking up the hill.

Chu Xiaoye still remembered the scene when he was chased by the water buffaloes and fled in a sorry state. He still remembered the scene of his few companions being trampled to death by the water buffaloes when they were young.

These big fellows that had once left a huge shadow in his young heart had mutated and become even taller and more ferocious.

They were currently queuing up and looking at the hill one by one with difficulty.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and was about to make way when the two water buffaloes that were the first to climb up the hill suddenly cried out and rushed over ferociously as if they did not take the little fellows seriously.

The mixed fur lion king and the blue-eyed lion king immediately roared angrily and rushed up.

Of course, they did not take the two water buffaloes seriously.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the two water buffaloes and ignored them. He brought the remaining team to the intersection and stood at the side.

Two water buffaloes were clearly not enough to eat. He should eat two more.

When the third and fourth water buffaloes climbed up one after another, they were like the previous two water buffaloes. They relied on their strong bodies to charge over confidently and arrogantly.

The Jerry brothers went up.

Chu Xiaoye circled around the two aggressive water buffaloes and walked towards the intersection.

When the fifth water buffalo was about to climb up, Chu Xiaoye suddenly slapped it on the head\!

It was already a little unsteady on its feet. With this slap, its huge body immediately fell and tripped the other water buffaloes following closely behind. They fell onto a somewhat steep hill and rolled down together.

The water buffaloes below were in chaos, shocked and furious.

The animals by the river were shocked and looked over.

Chu Xiaoye brought the Chino brothers and stood at the gap on the hill. He looked down at the huge water buffalo and decided to use a lion as a barrier. He would teach this group of arrogant fellows a lesson\!
