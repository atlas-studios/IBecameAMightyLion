Chapter 365: Untitled

"Roar\!"

The roars of the Chino brothers sounded from the river outside the bushes. In the quiet night, the grassland on both sides of the river was exceptionally clear.

Although the sisters often bullied the brothers previously, the two sisters were loyal and responsible to this territory. Not only did they hunt, they also took the initiative to patrol the territory, saving the brothers a lot of trouble.

They missed them after not seeing her for a long time.

Pit was a natural friend and soon befriended the two strong warthogs.

Since they were of the same species and not enemies, they were friends.

As for the cute violent bear mother and son, other than greeting Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, they also exchanged glances with the little girl they met for the first time and were very warm.

As for the other members of the pride of the cold father, the cute violent bear mother and son pair ignored them.

The little girl also liked these round and cute violent bears very much. Soon, she giggled and played with them.

Chu Xiaoye sighed inwardly. They were both cute and were like family.

After settling the members of the pride of the cold father down, Chu Xiaoye did not stop. Instead, he prepared to go to his former territory with Mixed Fur to see the situation.

Mixed Fur's pride did not come as promised. Clearly, something had happened.

When Chu Xiaoye left with Mixed Fur, only Catherine followed behind stubbornly and silently.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei had wanted to go too, but he stopped them sternly.

Now that the pride had just migrated and were not even familiar with the environment here, dangers were lurking everywhere. They had to stay and protect the pride.

As for Tilly, the moment she returned, she climbed up the tree to sleep.

The female cub was extremely excited on the way. She kicked up a fuss and refused to rest. In the end, as soon as she returned, she could not take it and was extremely sleepy. She obediently went to sleep.

When Chu Xiaoye brought Mixed Fur and Catherine to the river, he saw that the Chino brothers were still squatting by the river, roaring with all their might and looking eagerly at the other side of the river.

To them, the Jiela sisters were not only a nightmare, but also a beautiful memory.

The two brothers were very tired, but they still tried their best to call out to the Jiela sisters, who were nowhere to be seen.

Chu Xiaoye did not disturb them. He walked to the river and jumped over.

Catherine and the mixed fur followed closely and jumped over.

"Roarâ€”"

Just as he jumped over the river, Chu Xiaoye followed the roars of the Chino brothers and roared loudly.

His roar traveled further in the quiet night.

If the Jiela sisters were nearby, they should be able to hear them. They were afraid that the two sisters had already left very far away, or that they had been forced to join another pride.

Then the Chino brothers must be the most dejected.

No response came from the dark grassland. There was only the roars of the Chino brothers, each more hoarse and desperate than the last.

The two fellows felt that they were going to be single again.

Even if there were many female lions in the pride, they had to rely on their ability to obtain favor.

Obviously, they did not have much ability in this pride. Any female lion could beat them up.

The territory of the mixed fur lion king was not far from here, about ten kilometers away.

For the energetic mutated lions who had great endurance, this distance could be reached quickly.

They did not avoid the territories of other prides and passed through them.

Actually, just as they reached the other side of the river, Chu Xiaoye's full roar had already attracted the attention of the pride in this territory.

Therefore, just as they walked for a distance, a majestic lion king came with a group of subordinates with a murderous aura.

The lion king would never show mercy to its own kind that invaded its territory. Furthermore, although Chu Xiaoye's roar was only calling for the sisters and had no other intentions, it was full of provocation in the lion king's ears.

The tall lion king rushed over with a group of subordinates and roared.

Mixed Fur was anxious and could not be bothered to talk nonsense with them. He pounced forward and slapped them one by one, instantly slapping the tall lion king and the two lions behind him to the ground.

The remaining female lions all stopped in place, their eyes terrified. They did not dare to take another step forward.

Mixed Fur's strength had already been displayed exquisitely on the snow mountain. After experiencing the life and death tempering of this period of time, his strength naturally improved.

Before he went to the snow mountain, he was one of the overlords of this grassland and made many lions tremble in fear. Now that he had returned, dealing with these little lion kings was naturally a piece of cake.

The lion king, who had been slapped to the ground, was considered a more sensible elite. He immediately got up and prepared to retreat, giving up this territory and the lionesses behind him.

However, Chu Xiaoye and the other two ignored them and left.

They were only borrowing the way and did not have the intention to snatch the territory or the lionesses.

At least, not yet.

When they passed by the second territory, Chu Xiaoye roared arrogantly again.

In the end, no lion appeared. Only a group of female lions rushed out with a murderous aura.

Among the female lions, Chu Xiaoye discovered the Jiela sisters at a glance.

The two sisters were still covered in scars, but their size and aura had increased a lot. They seemed to have become the leaders of this pride.

This pride, including the Jiela sisters, had a total of eight female lions. Their fur was messy and they were covered in wounds. They had experienced many battles, and all of them had a fierce aura and fierce eyes. They seemed to be even braver than lions.

When they came close aggressively, the Jiela sisters recognized Chu Xiaoye.

The current Chu Xiaoye had already grown a lot and was about 150 kilograms. There was a dense and striking golden mane on his neck. His roar just now was also much different from before.

The sisters looked at the young king in disbelief. However, they soon reacted and immediately growled. They ran over, lowered their tails, lowered their heads, and rubbed Chu Xiaoye's neck and body warmly and fawningly.

They knew how strong this young lion king was. Furthermore, their lives were saved by this lion king.

If not for the fact that the black-haired lion king was too strong, the two sisters would definitely guard that territory for this young king.

The reason why they occupied this territory and gathered many wandering female lions was because they wanted to wait for this young king to return and return to that territory one day.

Now that their king had returned, they were naturally excited.

The remaining six female lions stood in place in a daze. They looked at the two sisters' enthusiastic and fawning appearance and felt strange and puzzled.

If the two sisters were fawning on the tall and mighty Mixed Fur, they could understand. They were clearly very strong and brave, so why were they fawning and being so passionate towards a lion that was still underage?

One had to know that even those strong adult lions were not worthy of their attention. They had already chased and killed many.

They could not understand that the king these two big sisters were waiting for was actually such a small and young lion.

The Jiela sisters raised their heads and called for them to come and recognize this young king.

Although the six female lions were a little hesitant, they still walked over obediently. They lowered their eyes and circled Chu Xiaoye to show their submission.

They only sincerely submitted to the two sisters. As for this underage lion king, to be honest, they were not convinced.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to care about them.

Since the Jiela sisters had been found, let's continue forward.

However, where was the lioness that had fled with the two sisters?

The female lion was called Lina and was once a member of the mixed fur lion king team. At this moment, she was nowhere to be seen.

Chu Xiaoye asked the sisters in a low voice.

The two sisters expressed that they did not know.

It seemed that the lioness had already dispersed and no one knew where she went.

Mixed Fur was eager to return and quickened his steps.

Jiela brought the six female lions and abandoned this territory without hesitation, following Chu Xiaoye.

Those six female lions were once wandering female lions that had been chased out of the pride. They had finally obtained their own territory, but now, they suddenly had to leave. Naturally, they were a little unwilling. However, they had always respected and thanked the sisters. Wherever these two sisters went, they would go and never leave.

Even if the young lion they followed was not reliable.

When they were about to reach the territory of Mixed Fur, a large group of spotted hyenas actually appeared.

The hyenas were clearly anxious because their nest was here. Although they knew that it was a pride, they still surrounded it without hesitation.

Not far behind them, the terrified cries of some spotted hyenas could be heard.

Under normal circumstances, the territory of the hyenas and the pride would not overlap. Since the hyenas lived here, this territory had clearly been occupied by them.

Seeing the black mass of hyenas, Mixed Fur's expression was a little grave.

Because spotted hyenas were never allowed to exist near his territory. Back when he was in that territory, he would lead his subordinates to hunt spotted hyenas from time to time and make them not dare to stay nearby.

At that time, under his strong pressure and bloody massacre, there were very few hyenas in a hundred miles around this land.

But now, the hyenas had actually swaggered in next door to his territory. The situation was very bad.

How could his pride tolerate such a situation?

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

More than thirty spotted hyenas surrounded them under the hyena queen's lead.

However, they did not attack. Instead, they roared loudly and threatened the pride to leave quickly.

Chu Xiaoye's team had already seriously threatened the safety of their cubs.

Mixed Fur bared its fangs and revealed a fierce gaze. Without any explanation, it pounced at the hyena queen without mercy\!

He would never allow this group of despicable and cunning dogs to appear near his territory\!

The hyena queen did not fight. She immediately roared and mixed into the hyenas, running to the side.

The other hyenas immediately ran around the mixed fur, creating chaos and disturbing their vision.

The mixed fur was very fast, but the hyenas were exceptionally united.

Under the hyena queen's orders, the other hyenas actually took the initiative to pounce on the mixed fur and started biting fiercely.

Although mixed fur was strong, two fists could not defeat four hands. Furthermore, the other party did not only have four hands.

All the hyenas pounced at him.

The hyena queen stopped at the periphery and continued to roar and order the battle.

However, in the next second, the hyena queen's roar stopped.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye shot out like a bolt of lightning. Before the hyena queen could react, he pushed her to the ground and bit her throat.

The strong hyena queen was even larger than him, but at this moment, her head was drooping and she was picked up by him. Her eyes were wide with fear and her mouth was open. She could not resist at all.

The scene of instantly killing the hyena queen stunned the female lions that were preparing to charge up and fight.

The hyenas that were ferociously attacking the mixed fur suddenly stopped and the roars in their mouths stopped. They looked blankly at their queen, who had just been roaring.

The noise from the previous moment was silent the next moment.

"Crack\!"

Chu Xiaoye bit the hyena queen's neck and threw her to the ground.

The hyena queen, who had extremely tenacious life force, widened her eyes and struggled on the ground a few times. She actually lowered her neck and stood up again.

The silent hyenas were about to roar and cheer when the hyena queen, who had just stood up, fell to the ground again. Then, blood sprayed from her neck, and she twitched a few times, letting out a cry\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and slapped her gently. The hyena queen on the ground flew out with a whoosh and smashed heavily on the heads of the two spotted hyenas. She actually broke their necks and lay on the ground, never to stand up again.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The remaining hyenas were stunned for a few seconds before they immediately roared in fear and dispersed, running for their lives\!

They ran in another direction and abandoned their nest and their cubs not far away.

The few spotted hyenas guarding their nests immediately abandoned their cubs and fled when they saw this scene.

For these animals that had a difficult life, they could give up everything in front of death.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and walked towards the hyena's nest.

The thin and weak spotted hyenas crawled into the cave in fear, trembling.

Catherine followed behind with a cold gaze and revealed her sharp silver claws.

Mixed Fur and the Jiela sisters followed with a murderous aura.

The six female lions finally woke up from their shock and immediately followed. Their gazes at the young figure had already changed from suspicion and unwillingness to fear.

In the cave, the childish cries of the spotted hyenas could be heard.

Their entire bodies were trembling, and they bared their thin teeth. Their faces were ferocious as they used their weak and helpless strength to resist one last time.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in front of a cave and looked at the young figures in the cave.

The sorrowful and hateful cries of the spotted hyenas came from the distant grassland, but they were getting further and further away and becoming more and more blurry.
