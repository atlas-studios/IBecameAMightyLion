Chapter 3: Learning Skills

Night fell.

There was still an air of uneasiness in the bushes.

Under the anxious and eager gazes of the lionesses and the cubs, their king, the majestic lion, finally returned triumphant with his head held high.

That lush and golden mane fluttered in the night wind, adding to his mighty aura\!

The five female lions went up to him one by one and rubbed his head and body in a fawning manner. They could finally relax.

Their king had won.

And their children were finally safe.

The little cubs finally relaxed and continued to play.

However, they did not dare to approach their father.

The male lion was too tall and majestic, unlike the lionesses who were loving and gentle, so the young cubs were all afraid of him.

However.

Little Curly Tail was not afraid at all. He ran over and grabbed the lion's tail daringly.

The lion was probably in a good mood because he had won the battle. For the first time, he tolerated Little Curly Tail's nonsense. He lay there and narrowed his eyes.

Little Curly Tail continued playing tirelessly and even jumped onto the lion's body to bite his mane.

This was something the lion could not tolerate\!

His mane was the symbol of his might and dominance. It was not to be blasphemed\!

"Roar—"

The lion suddenly opened its mouth and roared at Little Curly Tail, who was on his back, with anger.

Little Curly Tail was scared out of his wits. He jumped off the lion's back and ran away.

The lion glanced at him disdainfully before lying back down and closing his eyes.

Chu Xiaoye was not sleepy.

He thought for a long time and decided to practice climbing trees first.

With his current age and physique, it was impossible for him to quickly become stronger.

The most important thing was to preserve his life.

Compared to the ground full of carnivores and large animals, the trees were much safer.

As long as he did not encounter animals like leopards or baboons on the trees.

Normally, these animals did not dare to enter lion territory anyway.

Actually, the biggest threat to the little cubs' lives did not come from other animals, but wandering lions.

But.

A lion's body was too heavy, and they were generally unwilling to climb trees. Even if they climbed a tree, they would only climb to a very low height. Moreover, they could only rest on a thick branch.

Therefore, if there came a day that his father was defeated and the wandering lion came to kill him, he could climb up a tree to hide.

He could not run away from the lion, and begging was useless.

He could only climb trees to save his life.

Hence, this skill was very suitable for him now.

There was a small tree beside him.

He decided to use the small tree to practise.

At the very least, he had to successfully climb up to the first branch first.

When he was practising tree climbing, Little Curly Tail, who was scared away by his father, ran over curiously. However, he did not dare to get too close and looked at him in confusion.

He seemed to be saying, "What's so fun about trees? Brother would rather play with trees than with me?"

Chu Xiaoye climbed for a while but did not manage to climb up.

He felt extremely tired.

But he was not discouraged and continued to practise while panting.

"Whoosh—"

Mei Mei, who was watching from the side, got excited. She rushed over and jumped up. Her four claws moved quickly and she actually climbed up to the first branch instantly\!

Then, the female cub lowered its head and looked at Chu Xiaoye proudly.

"..."

Chu Xiaoye was very depressed.

Little Curly Tail did not want to be outdone. He quickly ran over, dashed forward, and jumped\!

In the end, his head hit the tree trunk heavily with a bang and he fell straight to the ground. He was in so much pain that he saw stars and cried out.

"Idiot\!"

Chu Xiaoye sighed.

It seemed that other than hunting and giving birth to cubs, female lions were born with many more skills than male lions.

Little Curly Tail wailed for a while before getting up from the ground. He looked up at Mei Mei, who was on the tree, and his fighting spirit was aroused. He climbed up the tree again.

In the end, he fell down again after climbing up a few steps.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly happy. This kid was willing to learn how to climb trees. That was exactly what he wanted.

He followed his brother's example and continued to climb up.

Little Curly Tail saw that he was not discouraged and did not mock him. He also stood up again and continued to climb.

Mei Mei stood on the branch and watched the brothers fail again and again. She could not understand.

It was so easy.

She decided to go down and demonstrate to the two brothers again.

In the end.

She could not get down.

"Roar\!"

She started to feel afraid.

After testing for a few times, her four limbs trembled and she could not hold on to the tree properly.

When she lowered her head, the tree felt so steep and high\!

"Mommy…"

On the branch, she wailed in fear.

Little Curly Tail was gloating under the tree and jumping around.

Chu Xiaoye finally climbed up in one go.

"Girl, don't be afraid. I'm here."

As a man, Chu Xiaoye naturally had to comfort this helpless and terrified girl.

He stood on the branch, raised his paw, and patted Meimei's head. He let out a roar with a calm expression.

"Girl, watch carefully. Learn from me and go down."

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and climbed onto the tree trunk, preparing to go down.

In the end…

"Mommy…"

He started to wail and tremble.

No wonder lions were unwilling to climb trees. It turned out that they had a natural fear of heights\!

The tree was clearly not that tall, so why was he trembling all over? He was so scared that he could not steady his body and claws anymore\!

The two little cubs, one male and one female, were crawling on the branches of the small tree, shivering and crying out for their mothers.

Chu Xiaoye felt embarrassed.

Little Curly Tail squatted under the tree, raised his head, and grinned, seemingly laughing again.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly had an idea.

Since he would free afraid when he looked down, he would climb down in reverse\!

He did not hesitate and immediately took action.

Indeed.

When his head looked up and he went down in reverse, his body finally stopped trembling and his claws could grab very firmly onto the tree trunk.

However, just as he was about to land on the ground, he suddenly lost his balance and fell down. He suddenly felt a sharp pain on his right claw\!

He raised his claw and saw a very sharp long splinter pierced in it\!

So painful\!

He trembled, but he did not think much of it. He bit down on it with his teeth, endured the pain, and pulled it out\!

The intense pain made him shiver all over\!

Fresh blood flowed out of the wound.

He did not have time to think. He immediately licked it with his tongue and started doing the most primitive disinfecting method.

Little Curly Tail circled around him and roared twice. It was obvious that he smelled blood and was very worried.

Mei Mei mimicked him and carefully retreated down from the tree to land safely.

The two little cubs surrounded him and rubbed his head, seemingly comforting him.

It was a little strange.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned.

The initially painful wound immediately stopped hurting after he licked it with his saliva.

At the same time, the strange heat in his abdomen suddenly surged up and flowed along the blood vessels in his body to the wound on his right claw.

The blood immediately stopped flowing.

The pain also completely disappeared.

He looked at his right claw and was secretly shocked.
