Chapter 246: Hope

After dark.

Chu Xiaoye found a patch of bushes and prepared to rest for the night. He would set off tomorrow morning.

After running around for a few days, the pride was already exhausted.

Although the grass was lush and the rainy season was approaching, the temperature was still not low.

To a lion with a thick mane on its neck, they could not take the continuous journey.

The mixed fur, his three subordinates, and the Jerry brothers were all uncomfortably hot. They wanted to pull off the majestic mane on their necks.

Just as they entered the bushes, they lay on the ground, panting, unwilling to get up again.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree skillfully and found a comfortable branch. He prepared to sleep and replenish his energy.

After returning to the territory tomorrow, he would continue to set off for the other side of the mountain to welcome Little Curly Tail and the others.

He could not delay for a day.

He had just lain down on the branch when Tilly climbed up and lay opposite him. She closed her eyes and slept.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her for a while, then turned around and aimed his butt at her.

Catherine climbed up a big tree beside him and looked at him silently in the shadow of the moonlight.

The two strong warthogs happily searched for fallen fruits to eat in the bushes, seemingly not knowing fatigue.

Blue had already climbed up the tree and fallen asleep.

Not long after Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes, the roar of a lion suddenly came from the grassland outside the bushes.

Then, two adult lions with dark manes ran over aggressively with a group of lions and female lions.

This was their territory.

When the lion king was patrolling, he smelled the scent of these invaders. There were many of them, so he immediately rushed over with the pride, preparing to fight the invaders.

However, when the two lions rushed into the bushes with the pride, they suddenly froze in place and did not dare to take another step forward.

The mixed fur lion king and the three lions stood up and stared at them coldly.

The Jerry brothers also stood up from the bushes at the side and walked over.

This pride had clearly mutated.

Their lion king was not much smaller than the mixed fur lion king, but it was smaller than the brothers.

They thought that the invaders were just some hungry wandering lions. Now, it seemed that they were a group of extremely strong lions.

Just the mixed fur lion king and the lion king were probably difficult to deal with. Furthermore, there were two tall and strong lions with gray fur.

At this moment, the pride stood in place, not knowing what to do.

The female lions and the other lions behind the lion king were uneasy and terrified.

The five adult lions in front of him were all tall and strong. They were aggressive and were clearly not to be trifled with.

If this was really an invader, they would probably pay a heavy price tonight.

"Roarâ€”"

The lion king stood in place and roared angrily. He asked the group of invaders what they wanted to do. This was their territory.

Under normal circumstances, there was naturally no need to waste his breath and they would start fighting.

When others invaded your territory, they would naturally fight you, kill you, and snatch your territory and wife.

However, facing this group of strong invaders, the lion king brothers were really a little terrified.

The mixed fur lion king was already very unhappy that its sleep was disturbed. Seeing that they were provoking him with more lions, how could it tolerate it? It immediately bared its fangs and roared, indicating that it naturally had to kill him since it came here\! Kill him, snatch his territory\! Snatch his lioness\!

The three lions behind him also roared angrily in unison, indicating that they were right. We're here to fight you\! What are you going to do?

The lioness, Lina, also bared her fangs and looked fierce.

The Jerry brothers stood at the side. Although they did not bare their teeth and roar, their huge body and strong aura gave this pride a lot of pressure.

Just as the two sides were about to fight, Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and walked over.

Catherine followed behind him silently like his shadow.

When they saw him appear, the mixed fur lion king and the others, who were baring their teeth and roaring angrily, preparing to charge up and fight, immediately quietened down and took the initiative to open a path.

The Jerry brothers walked over and followed Chu Xiaoye and Catherine respectfully.

The pride opposite was a little stunned when they saw this scene.

Chu Xiaoye did not speak nonsense. Instead, he walked in front of a big tree in front of him and revealed his golden claws. Then, he suddenly grabbed the tree trunk. His sharp golden claws pierced through the tree trunk and dug out half of the tree trunk with a whoosh\!

"Bang\!"

Then, he slapped it\!

The entire tree broke with a crack and fell, landing in front of the pride.

After a short silence, the pride no longer roared.

The lion king brothers put away their fangs, turned around, and left with the pride. They were dejected, like invaders who had been chased away.

It was best not to fight among their own kind. There was no need to kill them.

This pride also knew that these invaders clearly did not really want to fight them because with their strength, they were no match for them.

In other words, the other party did not covet their territory and the female lions.

Or perhaps, they did not fancy him at all.

He was clearly just a passerby.

Therefore, they pretended that nothing had happened and continued to go home to sleep.

If the invaders did not leave the next day, they would leave.

After all, survival was the most important.

After Chu Xiaoye frightened the owner of this place away with his golden claws, he continued to sleep on the tree.

Catherine also returned to her tree silently.

The mixed fur lion king looked at his back. After seeing him leave, it walked under the broken tree and opened its mouth, its eyes filled with sincere respect.

He raised his claws and tried to grab the broken tree. In the end, he realized that his claws could only scratch into the bark but not the wood inside, let alone tear off half of the tree trunk.

As for breaking the tree trunk with one slash, he did not have the strength to do so.

Obviously, the young king had become even stronger after the trip to the snow mountain.

His heart was filled with envy. Of course, he was more impressed.

He did not follow the wrong king.

In the future, their pride would become the most dazzling pride on this grassland\!

The Jerry brothers turned around and left, returning to the bushes to continue resting.

The mixed fur lion king looked at them and then looked up at the little white lion on the tree. It admired the king's methods and charm.

The night was very short.

They returned to the grass and took the time to sleep.

After dawn.

Chu Xiaoye brought this strange formation formed by lions, leopards, and two warthogs to face the morning sun and continued forward.

They were pleased with themselves.

At the same time.

The Chino brothers were waiting.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were far away, were also waiting.
