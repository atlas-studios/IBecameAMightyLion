Chapter 359: Untitled

Night fell.

A full moon quietly rose.

The night sky here looked even more enchanting.

The bright moon and the brilliant stars stood on the treetops, seemingly within reach.

The powerful aura of the lions made the night around them particularly peaceful.

The vultures that had been circling in the sky for a long time had left reluctantly, preparing to come back tomorrow. The carnivores that had heard the news had also retreated far away, hiding in the dense bushes and bushes, patiently and quietly waiting.

For them, even if they waited for two or three days for food, they might not find anything after two or three days. It was common.

For them, even if they waited for two or three days for food, they might not find anything after two or three days. It was common.

Unless it was a pack of hyenas with an overwhelming advantage in numbers.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Speak of the devil\!

This animal's sense of smell was terrifyingly sensitive.

Cheetahs, leopards, wolves, even lionesses and other prey would often be snatched away by them.

The truth was that the hyena's hunting skills were not inferior to a lion's. Each time, it would be a fruitful battle, but it could never change the habit of stealing the fruits of others' labor.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's team was already full.

More than half of the wild beef was still left on the grass in the bush forest. The strong smell of blood floated on the surrounding grassland, stimulating the taste buds of all carnivores.

However, most carnivores would only come after the lions left.

Only the spotted hyenas dared to face the might of the lion group and barge in.

Typically, after the lions had eaten their fill, they would turn a blind eye to other carnivorous animals stealing food.

Except for the hyenas.

When old enemies met, there was great hatred\!

As the raucous and annoying howls drew closer, Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch and looked up. On the grassland beyond the bush forest, a group of strong spotted hyenas, slightly larger than the cold father, were marching toward them under the lead of the Hyena Queen.

Roughly counting, there were actually over 50 of them\!

As for the hyena queen, not only was she enormous, comparable to a local male lion, but her speckled fur was actually black and red, shining with a demonic luster in the moonlight.

Her mouth was longer than a normal hyena's, protruding like a wolf's. When she howled, her canine teeth were thick and strong, like sharp blades.

At this moment, the members of the Cold Father's pride heard the provocative howls of these spotted hyenas and immediately got up. Without hesitation, they rushed out of the bush forest and prepared to fight.

However, when the cold father and the lionesses saw the group-sized creature not far away, they were all shocked\!

Was this group of terrifying creatures really their nemesis, the spotted hyenas?

Even Little Curly Tail and Meimei were shocked.

This thing was too big and strong\!

Chu Xiaoye's gaze was solemn. She immediately climbed down the tree and crouched down in front of the little girl while growling.

The little girl was originally resting under the tree, but when she heard the hyenas, she wasn't too afraid or worried because she believed in the strength of the pride.

However, seeing that this young lion king looked a little nervous, she immediately became nervous.

It seemed that this group of enemies was a little dangerous.

Chu Xiaoye lay in front of her and let out a low growl again, feeling a little impatient.

The little girl finally understood. She immediately got up and climbed onto his back, hugging his neck tightly with her two arms.

Chu Xiaoye immediately carried her and jumped onto the tree. He climbed to a high place and carefully placed her on a thick branch.

This was the little girl's first time climbing a tree. When her white leather shoes stepped on the branch, she felt a little slippery and her legs trembled and turned limp.

She immediately squatted down and sat on the branch, grabbing the branch beside her tightly with both hands. Her watery eyes were filled with fear.

She knew that this young lion king was going to fight alongside his companions. He could not stay by her side and let her rely on him.

Now, she could only rely on herself.

She suddenly felt a little guilty.

To this team, she was only a burden and could not do anything.

When Chu Xiaoye turned around and was about to go down the tree, the little girl suddenly stuck her head over and kissed him gently on the forehead. Her blue eyes were filled with gentleness and prayer.

"King, come back early."

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled and he looked at her in a daze. He was stunned for a few seconds before he raised his claws and gently stroked her soft golden hair. He nodded.

"Yes."

He jumped and landed on a shorter tree trunk at the side. Then, he used the force to jump again and landed steadily on the ground. His golden mane jumped like flames in the night.

The little girl lowered her head and looked at him with trembling eyes.

He also turned around and looked at her on the tree.

At this moment, the distance between this young lion from the grassland and this human girl from the human world seemed to have increased further. A connection seemed to be silently established in his heart.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and strode away.

The little girl sat on the tree and looked at him silently. She felt that with every step he took, she would be more afraid.

"King, come back early."

She muttered in her heart again.

The members of the pride of the cold father, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, Jerry, and the others had already walked out of the bushes and stood in a row, waiting solemnly.

Although the other party had a lot of members and their auras were fierce, and although they were already full and did not need those prey anymore, this was not the time to retreat and tolerate.

They had just arrived and were facing their old enemies. They had to show their might and dignity in this battle\!

They could not lose\!

Qiqi and Nunu had already climbed onto the tree by themselves.

Pit and Little Mi also crawled into the cave.

Pit had already developed a habit. Every time they stopped at a place, as long as they rested for more than half a day, the first thing they would do was dig the pit. The deeper the better.

Little Mi had become good friends with him and naturally enjoyed his cave.

As for the leopard sisters, Belia and Belita followed behind the lionesses, preparing to fight.

The genes and physiques of the two sisters were very special. Their current bodies were even larger and stronger than those of the female lions. Their strength could not be underestimated.

Leopards were not cheetahs. In a one-on-one battle, strong and agile leopards were not afraid of hyenas.

Even against two or three spotted hyenas and ferocious leopards, they had a high chance of winning.

After growing and evolving during this period of time, and training their combat skills with Chu Xiaoye, the Belita sisters' courage and strength had a qualitative leap.

Now that they had Chu Xiaoye, a fellow with abnormal strength, guarding them, they were even less afraid.

Under the lead of the hyena queen, the fifty spotted hyenas stopped seven to eight meters away and faced the pride.

They were quickly measuring each other's strength.

In the distant darkness, many cold eyes lit up. The carnivores that did not dare to approach this place for the time being seemed to be secretly delighted by the hyenas' charge.

When lions and dogs fought, they benefited.
