Chapter 537: The Seed of Love

"Roar—"

Just as he was about to reach the city wall, Chu Xiaoye suddenly let out a roar.

Their cries rushed into the sky and spread outside the city.

The army that had been waiting outside the city for a long time immediately surged towards Black Water City.

He originally planned to jump down from the city wall with these people and fall into the Black River below to escape.

But now, he suddenly changed his mind.

Because this eldest son of Black Water City seemed to have a good reputation among the soldiers of Black Water City. Furthermore, this eldest son still wanted Carter to marry him. 

Although it was despicable, he had to use this at this moment.

"Princess, as long as Lord Sorvil is willing to open the city gate and let our army in, it means that Lord Sorvil is sincere to you. You need the support of Blackwater City and a brave husband. Therefore, please consider marrying Lord Sorvil."

Chu Xiaoye turned into a lion. When he said these words, he was not afraid of blushing or feeling guilty.

Carter was stunned for a moment. She looked at him and immediately understood. "If my army can come in, it will mean that Black Water City trusts me. Lord Sorvil, I will consider it carefully."

When she said these words, the sword in her hand was still pressed against Sorvil's neck. Even the few pure elves beside her could see that she was not sincere and hypocritical.

However, at this moment, no one knew if Sorvil was terrified by his brother's sudden death, if he was suddenly shocked by Carter's desperate move, or if he had no choice but to retreat because of the sword on his neck.

He said excitedly, "Really? Sister Carter, can you really reconsider?"

Carter said without blushing, "Of course, if you can gain my trust, if your father won't pursue the matter of your brother's death."

Sorvil had been cut in the thigh by her and was still bleeding, but he did not seem to care. He said excitedly, "Sister Carter, I can swear that my love for you…"

"Sorvil\!"

Carter interrupted him and said, "Your father is about to come with the army. At that time, in his anger, he will definitely not listen to your advice and order me to be killed. Now, please order the soldiers to open the city gate and let my people in. Only in this way will I be safe and I will believe that you really love me."

At this moment, they had already retreated to the city gate.

Due to the fact that Sorvil was in their hands, the soldiers were afraid of attacking and did not attack. Instead, they retreated and waited for an opportunity.

Sorvil raised his head and looked to the left of the city gate. He shouted, "Hatton\! Open the city gate and put down the drawbridge\!"

The orc general guarding under the city gate looked embarrassed and at a loss.

Sorvil glared at him and continued to roar angrily, "Hatton\! Are you deaf? I told you to open the city gate and put down the drawbridge\!"

At this moment, the sounds of hooves were already rolling outside Black Water City. The Carter army had already arrived.

The orc general said with an ugly expression, "Your Excellency, the army outside is already under the city. If we open the city gate, the army will definitely swarm in and our Black Water City will be completely occupied\!"

Sorvil roared angrily, "Hatton\! You once swore to the Thunder God that you would be loyal to me\! I'm ordering you to open the city gate and put down the hanging bridge\!"

The contradiction on Hatton's face immediately turned to bitterness. He lowered his head and said, "Yes, my lord."

"Open the city gate and put down the drawbridge\!"

He ordered the soldiers guarding the winch.

However, at this moment, another general suddenly walked down from the stairs on the city wall and said sternly, "No\! Lord Sorvil, if you put down the drawbridge and wait for their army to enter, they will never let you go\! Our Black Water City will also change owners\! We only need to wait for the City Lord to transfer his troops over. They are already turtles in a jar and will never dare to hurt you\!"

"Catherine\!"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly called out.

When the general said loudly and walked down the stairs with his sword in hand, a figure suddenly jumped out from the side\!

"Whoosh\!"

Silver light flashed and cut open the armor on his body, opening his stomach\!

"Lord Sorvil\! The princess's life is in your hands\! Open the city gate quickly\! If your father comes, the princess will definitely be killed\! You'll regret it\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted.

Sorvil immediately shouted angrily, "Hatton\!"

The orc general could only pull out the sword at his waist and continue to instruct, "Open the city gate\! Put down the drawbridge\!"

The soldiers immediately listened and took action.

"Squeak…"

The thick city gate slowly opened.

At the same time, the strong drawbridge started to be lowered\!

"Stop\! Don't open the city gate\! I order you to close the city gate immediately\!"

Right at this moment, the City Lord of the Black Water City, Carlo, rushed over with his guards and shouted sternly.

The soldiers who were lowering the drawbridge were stunned for a moment. Just as they were about to pull the drawbridge up again, Chu Xiaoye suddenly rushed up with a whoosh.

"Vilis\! Come and help\!"

Vilis immediately used the spinning storm and rushed up.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Fei'er and Denise's arrows also followed and hit the soldiers.

Chu Xiaoye pounced in front of the two soldiers, raised his golden claws, and cut their throats.

He could not care less about his shame and immediately turned into an elf youth. He hugged the huge winch and used all his strength to start twisting it.

The huge sword loli with natural divine strength also rushed over and immediately helped him exert strength.

The sturdy drawbridge continued to fall.

Outside the city, the Carter army was already impatient and roared like thunder.

"Kill them\! Kill them\!"

Carlo rushed over with the soldiers and roared with an extremely ugly expression.

At this moment, Sorvil was still fantasizing and said loudly, "Father, you can't\! We can't hurt the princess\! The princess was not at fault for Cook's death, it was…"

"Shut up\!"

Carlo rushed over with a livid face and shouted at the soldiers to shoot arrows. "Shoot them to death\! Shoot these animals to death\!"

"Who dares to be impudent\!"

Carter suddenly shouted, "I'm the princess Carter Danota\! I'm the daughter of your king\! I passed by here under the king's orders\! Whoever dares to attack will be punished for disobedience and treason\!"

"Boom\!"

At this moment, the drawbridge was finally lowered.

"Charge\!"

The Carter army was like a ferocious beast as they roared and rushed in\!

When the soldiers of Black Water City saw this, they immediately panicked and stood there in a daze, not knowing what to do.

Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Carlo hurriedly turned around and ran, shouting, "Return to the castle\! Return to the castle\!"

Merck, who was beside him, still ordered the archers angrily, "Shoot\! Shoot these rebels to death\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Denise's arrow shot over and pierced through his throat.

This general of Black Water City, Sorvil's uncle, opened his mouth and took a few steps back. He raised his hand and grabbed the arrow at his throat. He suddenly roared and pulled out the arrow with a puff\!

However, this did not stop him from dying.

The moment the arrow was pulled out, blood sprayed. He finally could not hold on and fell to the ground. His mouth was still moving and he looked very unwilling.

Originally, they were already confident of victory. The princess had entered the city and was already a turtle in a jar. As for the twenty thousand strong army outside, they did not have a commander. As long as they imprisoned the princess, the twenty thousand strong army would become Black Water City's. At that time, they would be able to achieve twice the results with half the effort in the name of the princess\!

Unfortunately, he lost everything now.

Merck died, but he did not die in peace.

Carter rode her warhorse and chased into the castle with the army. In a moment, he attacked and captured Carlo.

Chu Xiaoye put on his clothes and brought Catherine and the elves into the castle with Sorvil in tow.

The army soon controlled the entire Black Water City.

Most of the soldiers of Black Water City did not have the time to resist before their weapons were handed over.

Everything happened so suddenly that General Merck suddenly died and Carlo's orders were not sent out in time. Everyone thought that this was the princess's army and would not do anything to them.

After all, their city lord was the princess's uncle and a member of the royal family.

Therefore, they surrendered obediently.

When the walls of Black Water City were filled with Carter's soldiers, the ancient and strong city finally announced a change in owner.

It was still the living room.

The difference was that there were no more machetemen in the compartment behind the curtain, and the main seat had already changed.

Carter sat there and poured herself a glass of red wine. She drank a few mouthfuls and handed it to Chu Xiaoye beside her. She smiled and said, "Night, with you around, there will always be unexpected surprises. Thank you."

When she left this living room previously, she thought that this Black Water City would seriously injure her. She did not know when her twenty thousand troops could enter. Even she might lose here.

Now, these worries no longer existed.

Chu Xiaoye took the wine glass but did not drink it. Instead, he placed it on the table and looked at her. "Princess, Lord Sorvil and Lord Carlo are still waiting for your decision."

Carlo had already been tied up and was standing in front of the chair where Carter had been sitting previously. He looked at her with hatred, and the warm and fake smile on his face was long gone.

As for Sorvil, he stood there in a daze.

Carter looked at them and fixed his gaze on Carlo. He smiled and said, "Uncle Carlo, are you going to surrender and swear your loyalty to me, or are you going to resist to the end?"

Carlo gritted his teeth and said, "Little bitch\! I should have let the executioner cut off your head long ago\! My heart softened and I actually killed Cook\! You little bitch, dream on if you want me to be loyal to you\!"

Sorvil, who was beside him, suddenly said, "Father, Sister Carter did not kill Cook. Sister Carter was forced to do this."

Carlo suddenly turned around and glared at him. "Shut up\! You animal\! You colluded with outsiders and harmed your brother\! You harmed my entire Black Water City\! You're not worthy to be my son\! You should be cut into pieces\!"

Sorvil lowered his head and was silent for a moment. Then, he suddenly raised his head and looked at Carter, his eyes still filled with hope. "Father, Sister Carter won't hurt us. She said that as long as we trust her, she will still marry me. Sister Carter, right?"

Carlo was stunned for a moment and looked at him in shock, as if he suddenly did not know this son.

Why did he never realize that the son he had such high hopes for was so stupid?

Sorvil did not seem to see the disappointment and shock in his father's eyes. He still looked at the girl he loved with hope, waiting for her to give him the answer he wanted the most.

Unfortunately, he did not get it.

Carter stood up and walked in front of him with a cruel smile. "Brother Sorvil, thank you for your trust. However, everything I said to you previously was fake. I won't marry you, and I can't let you live."

The moment that was said, not only did Sorvil's expression change, Chu Xiaoye was also shocked. He hurriedly stood up and said, "Carter\!"

However, before he could finish, Carter pierced the dagger into Sorvil's chest and his heart with a puff. She sneered. "Sorvil, I need your Blackwater City and your army, so sorry."

Sorvil looked at her with his eyes wide open and slowly fell to the ground. Even though he fell to the ground, he still tilted his head and looked at her. He let out a desperate and painful voice. "Sister… Sister Carter, I… I will always love you…"

With that said, he died completely, but his amber eyes were still open.

"Little b\*tch\!"

Carlo roared angrily and pounced at Carter.

Unfortunately, he was tied up.

Carter turned around and cut his throat clean.

Carlo fell to the ground, blood flowing from his throat. He was still cursing.

But soon, he stopped breathing.

Carter turned around and looked at the young man standing up behind him. He spread out her hands and said, "I have to kill them. Because as long as they're still alive, the soldiers of Black Water City will not swear loyalty to me willingly. As for me, I won't be at ease letting them lead the army again. Night, with your intelligence, you should know."

Chu Xiaoye looked at Sorvil, who was lying on the ground, and said with a complicated expression, "It doesn't matter if you kill Carlo, but Sorvil, you can let him live. Even if you don't give him the military power, don't let him lead the army, and banish him to other places, you can still do it. There's no need to kill him. Carter, without him today, we can't succeed."

Carter walked back to his seat and sat down. She poured himself a cup of wine and looked at him. "I knew that you would be soft-hearted. You were like this when you were in the pride. This Black Water City is their father and son. They have operated here for so many years, and these eight thousand soldiers have all sworn loyalty to them. If I don't kill him and only banish him, many people will leave too. Furthermore, those soldiers must be thinking about their old masters. I don't want anyone to deliberately not contribute or suddenly change sides in battle. Therefore, I have to break the thoughts of those soldiers."

Lanisi suddenly said, "Aren't you afraid that those soldiers will resent you?"

Carter smiled and said, "To those soldiers, resentment is only temporary. When they completely integrate into my army and obtain more honor and wealth, they naturally won't hate anymore. Most of them became soldiers not to be loyal to anyone, but to survive and for their families. Therefore, I believe that after the death of Carlo and his son, they will definitely find a more promising master to be loyal to. That master is me\!"

Lanisi said, "Let's hope so."

Carter looked at her and said with a smile, "Lanisi, you and your elves can choose to be loyal to me. In that case, no one will have any designs on your elves anymore. What do you think?"

Lanisi raised her eyebrows and looked at Chu Xiaoye beside her. She said with a faint smile, "Night, what do you think?"

Chu Xiaoye sighed and said, "Your Majesty, why test me? I know that the elves will not be loyal to anyone or any faction, even if they are exterminated. Therefore, I think that you can take it that General Carter, oh no, Queen Carter just farted. Don't care about her\!"

Lanisi smiled at Carter, shrugged, and stopped talking. Her meaning was self-evident.

Carter was not angry. Instead, she looked at her king and said, "Speaking of smelly farts, Night, who can compare to you? I'm a little strange. In the past, in that critical situation, I thought that you would fart. I was paying attention to your tail and preparing to cover my nose. However, you did not move for a long time. In the end, you did not fart. Why, did the former smelly fart king turn over a new leaf?"

Chu Xiaoye revealed an embarrassed expression and sighed. "I let out too much in the elf country that day. Now, I've been transforming back and forth. I haven't had the time to accumulate the smelly farts in my body. Even if I want to, I can't let them out."

When Carter heard that, she thought it was true. "Me too. Every time I transform, I feel that I've exhausted a lot of energy. If I transform a few more times, my body won't be able to take it. I have to rest for a few days."

At this point, Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of something that might very well happen.

He looked at Lanisi and said, "Your Majesty, according to you, when the creatures of the outside world enter, they will encounter their true selves in here. They have to kill the other party or be killed by the other party in order to survive. Then, will everyone be in the same situation as me and Carter? After everyone comes here, they can change their bodies back and forth? And you might also have the outside you wanting to kill you?"

Lanisi thought for a moment and nodded. "That should be possible."

Fei'er, who was sitting beside him, suddenly had a grave expression as she asked worriedly, "Lord Night, please allow Fei'er to stay by your side in the future. This way, you can help Fei'er kill the fake Fei'er."

Before Chu Xiaoye could reply, Carter smiled and said, "Then, you should swear loyalty to your Lord Night."

Fei'er smiled and said, "There's no need to swear. Fei'er will definitely be loyal to Lord Night. Of course, she will also be loyal to Her Majesty."

Carter's eyes lit up. "What if one day, your Lord Night and your queen suddenly turn against each other? Who will you help?"

Fei'er still had a smile on her face as she shook her head and said, "No, Her Majesty will not turn against Lord Night. Her Majesty is…"

"Fei'er\!"

Lanisi immediately interrupted her and looked at Carter. "I think we should talk about you first. Although you defeated Sunset Pass and took down Black Water City, you're still very far from your Holy City. Are you still confident?"

Carter raised her glass and smiled. "Of course, and I'm very confident. If your Lord Night will continue to help me."

She tilted her head and looked at the young man beside her, saying with a smile, "Will you? Lord Night?"

Chu Xiaoye also picked up his wine glass and said, "Of course. If you don't say that you will definitely repay me in the future."

Carter suddenly laughed charmingly, pursed her red lips, and raised her eyebrows. "Then, let's talk about it in the future."
