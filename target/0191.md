Chapter 191: The Lion King's Battle\!

"Roar—"

Their roars were like thunder and rolled like the tide\!

Obviously, the battle had already started.

Chu Xiaoye quickened his steps and ran over.

On the grassland near the border, two huge and extremely strong lions were fighting an intense battle.

The blue-eyed lion king's thick burgundy mane was especially striking under the sun.

His originally strong body seemed to have grown again.

Although it was not as exaggerated as those white lions, it was much larger than the Chino brothers.

The lion that fought him was also extremely tall and strong, comparable to his size. The thick mane on his neck was black and almost extended to his entire back, making him look extremely mighty\!

The two strong lions fought and bit, roaring continuously. The battle was exceptionally fierce and terrifying.

The female lions and the few male lions of the blue-eyed lion king's pride stood not far away quietly, watching silently. They did not go forward to help.

Chu Xiaoye looked carefully and realized that the blue-eyed lion king's right hind leg seemed to be injured. When it ran and jumped, it clearly did not have the agility and flexibility it had when fighting him previously.

He was probably injured in that mysterious snow mountain.

This lion king had its face disfigured in the battle with him previously and its appearance was terrifying. Now that it was limping, it had long lost its former prestige.

His once loyal subordinates, the lionesses and lions, were looking at him coldly and disdainfully.

The strong lion with a black mane seemed to have already obtained the recognition of most of the members of this pride.

However, this former majestic lion king was not prepared to admit defeat.

He was fighting with his life\!

The wandering lion took advantage of his hind legs' inability to move and suddenly moved behind him, attacking fiercely from behind.

Under his teasing, the blue-eyed lion king spun in panic. However, its reaction was too slow and its butt was still bitten and dripping with blood.

Usually, at this time, as long as he lay down and admitted defeat or turned around to escape, the other party would let him go.

However, he was not willing to lose his territory and lionesses, let alone flee in a sorry state in front of his subordinates.

He endured the pain and continued to fight.

Obviously, he was preparing to die here\!

The wandering lion was extremely cunning. It no longer bit him head-on and circled around him, slowly exhausting his strength and spirit.

His mouth, face, back, and butt were covered in bloody wounds. There were also old wounds on his hind legs. Clearly, he could not last for long.

The outcome was decided.

From today onwards, this territory would welcome a new lion king\!

This tall and strong wandering lion with a black mane was about to inherit his throne and obtain his vast and fertile territory, his lionesses, and his subordinates.

The female lions and subordinates behind him had cold gazes and did not have any reaction.

The blue-eyed lion king's entire body trembled in pain. It took a step back and squatted on the ground. It still bared its fangs and turned its upper body to make a dying struggle.

Obviously, he was determined to die.

When Chu Xiaoye walked to the border, the female lions and male lions immediately looked terrified.

The battle that night had left an unforgettable shadow in their hearts.

This young lion was a nightmare that they could not forget for the past few days\!

Their powerful super pride was almost destroyed by him after the battle that night.

Fortunately, this young lion was not an insatiable person. It did not invade their territory again and only took away a little.

However, why was he here now?

The female lions and the few male lions looked uneasily at the young figure that was like a demon in front of them.

Chu Xiaoye walked to the border and stopped. Then, he peed on the border in front of them, intending to inform the new king who was about to ascend the throne that the territory here was already his. He hoped that he would not cross the line.

Behind him, Catherine watched as he peed and felt inexplicably flustered. She looked away, but she could not help but lower her head to look.

"Roar—"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was peeing and marking the territory, the black-haired lion suddenly raised its head, bared its fangs at him, and roared.

Clearly, this new king who was about to ascend the throne was not prepared to admit his sovereignty over this territory\!

It seemed that this new king did not take him seriously.

In other words, when the blue-eyed lion king was defeated and died, it would be this new king who would reclaim this forest territory and expel or kill him.

Chu Xiaoye stopped peeing and looked up at the tall and strong lion.

"Whoosh—"

However, before he could react, Catherine, who was behind him, had already rushed over like lightning. She swung her sharp claws and grabbed the wandering lion's face with a whoosh\!

The wandering lion did not have the time to react before it felt a burning pain on half of its face. It raised its claws and touched it. It was dripping with blood and badly mutilated\!

Catherine looked at him coldly and turned around to return behind Chu Xiaoye, as if she had done something insignificant.

"Roar—"

The wandering lion was furious. It immediately put down the blue-eyed lion king, who was already powerless to struggle, and crossed the border. It pounced ferociously at Catherine, baring its fangs and looking ferocious\!

However, just as he crossed the border and before he could pounce close, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed up. He suddenly swung his right claw and, with a bang, sent his nearly 400- kilogram body flying\!

Before he could land on the ground, Chu Xiaoye rushed up again and slapped him a second time, sending him flying out of the border and landing beside the blue-eyed lion king.

The blue-eyed lion king was stunned at first, but then it roared angrily and suddenly pounced forward, biting the wandering lion's abdomen\!

The sharp fangs pierced through the wandering lion's abdomen and into his internal organs\!

"Chi—"

The blue-eyed lion king carried endless hatred and anger. It suddenly swung its head and its sharp teeth tore off a large piece of flesh from the wandering lion's abdomen\!

"Whoosh\!"

Blood sprayed and internal organs flowed out\!

The wandering lion finally woke up from its stunned state after being slapped twice. It suddenly let out a scream and rolled violently on the grass in pain.

As he rolled, the blood and internal organs in his abdomen flowed even faster\!

In a moment, the green grass was dyed red with blood.

The blue-eyed lion king retreated to the side, its mouth full of blood. It bared its fangs and looked at him in a daze. Clearly, it had yet to react from the sudden change in its defeat to victory after escaping death.

No one knew how the wandering lion felt at this moment.

The female lions and lions that originally liked him and were preparing to welcome him as the king froze in place, stunned.

They turned their heads and looked at the young lion king at the border.

"Chi—"

Chu Xiaoye continued to pee and looked at them warningly. He wanted to see who still dared to covet and cross his territory\!

Those who trespass my territory will be killed no matter how strong they are\!

Catherine quietly lay down behind him.
