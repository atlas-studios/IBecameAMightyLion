Chapter 554: Old Friends on the Grassland

"Go around it\!"

Chu Xiaoye gestured at Catherine on the tree.

Although he was a little curious as to why those orcs would surround the elephant herd again, now was not the time to be curious. Their current state was not good to begin with, and if there were more complications, they might really not be able to leave.

Catherine changed directions and prepared to circle around the forest on the side.

Right at this moment, low-frequency buzzing sounds suddenly sounded from the elephant herd, sounding terrified and anxious.

The elephants were crying for help\!

Chu Xiaoye stopped in his tracks and turned to look.

For some reason, when he heard the terrified cries of these elephants, he seemed to have returned to the former grassland. He looked at the beautiful scene on the grassland and was suddenly destroyed by the human shotguns.

The animals fell one by one, their bodies filled with bloody holes, terrified and in despair.

The scream formed a strong contrast to the cruel laughter of humans.

The rhinoceros horn was cut off, the ivory was uprooted, the lion skin was peeled off, and the antlers were taken away. Even the crocodiles in the water could not escape the bad luck of being skinned.

Chu Xiaoye's chest seemed to be burning with flames, hot and furious.

He stopped in place and stopped advancing.

Catherine looked at him from the tree and stopped too.

"Night, what's wrong?"

Seeing that he had suddenly stopped and had a wrong expression, Lanisi hurriedly asked.

Vilis and the others, who were walking in front, also stopped and turned around to look at him in confusion.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his head and looked at Catherine on the tree.

Catherine did not hesitate and returned to that direction with a few leaps. She looked carefully for a while before wagging her tail at him.

"About thirty orcs."

Chu Xiaoye had already decided. He looked at the concerned Elven Queen beside him and said, "Lanisi, I have to save that elephant herd. If you…"

"Night, let's go. Let's go together."

Before he could finish, Lanisi pulled out the sword at his waist and said to the elven girls in front of him, "Just like before, Denise and Fei'er are shooting arrows from afar. I, you, Vilis, and Catherine will charge up and fight. Doya will hide behind Denise and Fei'er."

Vilis turned around and returned.

Denise, Fei'er, and Doya walked over.

These girls almost did not hesitate or ask why he suddenly wanted to take the risk to save the elephant herd. They did not even ask how many orcs there were.

Was this stupidity, trust? Or other feelings?

To be honest, Chu Xiaoye was quite touched.

"There are only thirty orcs, but be careful of traps."

With their previous experience, they could not make the same mistake again.

Chu Xiaoye pulled out his sword and walked in front.

Catherine jumped silently on the tree and quickly sensed the origin.

A group of orcs were holding spears and bows, attacking more than ten elephants.

The male and female elephants surrounded the city and protected the little elephants at the back.

A few young male elephants were shot in the body and head, but they still stood there motionless, protecting their families.

The orcs started to approach and test with the spears in their hands.

They were also afraid that these elephants would suddenly go crazy and charge over together.

However, in order to protect the little elephants inside, the elephant herd did not seem to have the intention to rush out.

Hence, the orcs became bold and approached step by step. They stabbed the eyes of two of the elephants with their spears.

The two elephants were too clumsy. They casually swung their noses and heads to dodge, but they still did not dodge.

The sharp spears pierced into their eyes and were quickly pulled out, almost pulling their eyeballs out.

The elephant swayed its head in pain, but it did not move away.

"Attack together\! Kill these big animals\! Those few little elephants are top-notch goods. They can definitely be sold for a high price\! At that time, everyone will have a share\!"

The orc leader raised his mace and roared, urging his subordinates to end the battle quickly.

Be it mounts or battle beasts, they had to be nurtured from young. Therefore, those few little elephants could definitely be sold for a good price.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was continuing to roar angrily, an arrow suddenly shot from the forest behind. With a whoosh, it pierced through the back of his head and out of his mouth\!

The orc leader's roar stopped.

He opened his mouth and froze for a moment before falling to the ground.

Other than the two orcs beside him who discovered it, the other orcs were still nervously approaching the elephants.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye and Vilis rushed up and swung their swords, slashing at the orcs.

Lanisi followed closely and stabbed the orc who was holding a spear and aiming at the elephant's eyes\!

"There are enemies\! There are enemies behind us\!"

The orcs that discovered them first immediately roared in fright.

At this moment, the orcs suddenly realized something. They hurriedly turned around and prepared to fight the enemy.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's arrows flew out one after another.

When the orcs turned around and prepared to fight, the adult elephants that were surrounding and protecting the little elephant suddenly buzzed and rushed up. They rolled up the orcs with their noses and then suddenly threw them into the air.

After the orcs fell heavily to the ground, what awaited them were sharp ivory and heavy elephant legs.

The cries of the orcs rose and fell.

In the blink of an eye, more than thirty orcs were killed cleanly, not leaving a single one alive.

Those adult elephants were very smart. They seemed to know that Chu Xiaoye and the others were here to save them. After killing the orcs, they retreated and did not attack angrily. They continued to form a circle to protect the little elephants behind them.

They still did not let down their guard.

Chu Xiaoye tried to walk close. Just as he was about to look at the little elephant inside, the ground suddenly trembled and rumbled\!

Then, terrifying iron hooves and the roars of wild beasts suddenly sounded from the forest beside him, as if a magnificent army was running towards them\!

"Leave quickly\!"

Chu Xiaoye's expression changed drastically. He hurriedly put away his sword and turned around to escape with the elven girls.

However, rumbling iron hooves suddenly sounded in the forest behind them.

Then, densely packed orcs rode rhinoceroses, warhorses, lions, and other mounts and ran out of the surrounding forest with a murderous aura\!

They and the elephant herd were surrounded.

The faces of the few female elves turned pale.

How could they escape this time?

They knew better than anyone how cruel and terrifying these orcs were, especially to girls like them.

"Night, please do something."

Lanisi held her sword and stuck it to Chu Xiaoye's body. She whispered, "If you can't escape, kill me. I'll be very happy to die under your sword."

Chu Xiaoye felt the Elven Queen's body trembling.

Fei'er, Denise, Vilis, Doya, and Catherine leaned over.

They knew that they could not escape calamity this time.

"Lord Night, please kill Fei'er later too. Fei'er is afraid and doesn't dare to do it herself."

Fei'er also begged.

Chu Xiaoye was regretful, guilty, and silent.

Vilis held her sword and said, "Don't worry, I'll help you. At least dying under my sword is better than being abducted by these orcs. Fei'er, Doya, follow behind me."

She knew that Chu Xiaoye could not do it. She would settle everything.

However, she could only help these two escape. As for Her Majesty, she could not do it.

As for Denise, she did not need to do anything.

She knew this girl's personality. If she died, she would be more fearless than anyone.

"Hey, I'll leave Her Majesty to you."

Vilis turned to look at the elf youth beside her and said, "Please."

This time, she did not call him short again against her will.

Chu Xiaoye did not speak. His hand that was holding the sword was trembling.

He lowered his head and looked at Catherine, who was at his feet.

Catherine understood what he meant and nodded slightly, looking forward coldly.

The surrounding orcs rode their mounts and surrounded them.

"Tsk tsk, there are actually elves here\! What beautiful and tender elves\!"

"Look at this figure and this skin. It's so tender and many times more sexy and beautiful than my smelly granny\! If you give it to me, I can't get out of bed for a month. Do you believe me?"

"Only a month? Do you have kidney deficiency? I can last for a year\!"

"Hahahaha…"

The surrounding orcs roared with laughter and stared at the elf girls covetously.

"Kneel down and automatically tie your hands. Come back with us and serve us well. We can spare your lives\!"

One of the orc leaders rode a big wild boar out and said with a grin.

Chu Xiaoye clenched the sword in his hand and was about to rush up when the orc team suddenly dispersed and made way.

"The leader is here. Move aside\!"

With a shout, the noisy orc team immediately quietened down.

Then, a fat super fatty that was like a ball slowly walked out of the passageway that the orc team made way on a tall female elephant.

The orcs immediately stood respectfully with their heads lowered, looking very respectful of this camp leader.

The fat chief carried a super big spiked club on his shoulder and looked quite compatible with his fat and huge body.

The orc leader riding a big wild boar hurriedly went up and said obsequiously with a face full of smiles, "Chief, I discovered a few little elves. They're all like flowers and jade, with tender skin and meat. There's also an elf youth among them, white, tender, and handsome. Hehe, if Chief likes him, you can take him in."

"Bang\!"

The fat chief slapped him in the face and sent him flying. He flew a few meters away and landed in the orc pile.

However, the head of the orc was rather strong and seemed to be used to being slapped. It hurriedly got up from the ground and wiped the blood flowing from the corner of its mouth. It went up to flatter him again. "I was wrong, I was wrong. I shouldn't have said anything."

The fat chief looked coldly at Chu Xiaoye and the others and said roughly, "Do you all know how to fart?"

The orc leader hesitated for a moment and said uncertainly, "Chief, according to my knowledge, the elves eat nectar, fruits, and other food. Their bodies are very clean, and they probably won't fart. Even if they know how to fart, they probably won't smell too bad."

"Kill\!"

When the fat chief heard this, he immediately lost interest and issued a kill order.

The moment this was said, the other orcs around felt their hearts ache, but they did not dare to say anything. They could only look anxiously at the orc leader.

The expression of the orc leader also changed. He hurriedly smiled obsequiously and said, "Chief, those little elves are very beautiful. Many of our subordinates have yet to taste women and like these little elves very much. Why don't we bring them back and let our subordinates play with them? It's not too late to kill them when we have had enough fun, okay?"

The fat chief looked at the elephant herd.

For some reason, when this fat chief appeared, the elephant herd that surrounded him suddenly dispersed and relaxed their vigilance.

The little elephant that was surrounded also walked out with its tail wagging. It even took the initiative to walk towards the fat chief, as if it had seen its family.

Not only did the adult elephants not stop them, they also followed behind and walked over, looking very docile.

It turned out that the targets they had just cried out for help were these orcs.

"Chief, from the looks of it, these little elves saved these elephants."

The orc leader rolled his eyes and said with a smile, "Why don't you show mercy and spare their lives, Chief? It can be considered as thanking them for the elephant herd."

Lanisi suddenly raised her sword. "We don't need to thank you. Just kill us. Don't even think of capturing us\!"

The fat chief looked over again and said hoarsely, "Little elf, can you fart? The very smelly kind?"

Lanisi was stunned for a moment and did not know how to answer.

"If you don't know how to let go, kill him\!"

The fat chief said coldly with a face full of disdain.

This was when Chu Xiaoye and the elven girls realized that this fatty was actually a woman. What hung down from her chest was not muscles, but a woman's chest.

Vilis suddenly pointed at Chu Xiaoye and said, "He knows how to let go\! The very smelly ones\!"

If he could survive, let him live. He was an outsider in this mission and should not accompany them to their deaths.

"Oh? Kid, you know how to fart? The very smelly and smelly kind?"

The fat chief's eyes lit up. He rode his female elephant over and said, "Try letting one out. If you satisfy me, you can live. If you dare to tease me, hmph, I'll cut off your butt first, then skin you alive and feed you to the dogs\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in a daze. He tried and realized that he could not let go at all.

Unless he became a lion.

How was he familiar with this fatty's hobbies?

"It looks like he's teasing me\!"

The fat chief's thick brows stood up and he said roughly, "Someone\! Press this kid to the ground and raise his butt\!"

The orc leader and another orc immediately walked up.

Chu Xiaoye immediately shouted, "Wait\! Chief, I do know how to fart. Furthermore, the fart I fart is definitely one of the few smelly farts in the world. Furthermore, there are many of them, so many that you can't imagine\!"

The fat chief sneered and said with a mocking expression, "Have elves also learned to brag? This chief has long smelled the world's most smelly fart. As an elf, no matter how smelly your farts are, can you smell worse than that fellow? I'll give you a minute. If you can't fart or your farts are ordinary, you'll be doomed\!"

That fellow?

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. The more he looked at the fatty, the more familiar he felt.

It was not that her appearance was very familiar, but her unique naivety was very familiar. Furthermore, when the elephants saw her, they actually looked as if they had seen their family. She, the dignified leader, actually brought so many orcs to save them after hearing the cries for help from the elephant herd.

These signs made him suspicious.

"Sorry, Lord Chief, I'm still farting for the time being."

Chu Xiaoye explained honestly.

The fat chief's face sank and he said with a murderous expression, "Looks like you're playing with me\! Good\! Very good\! Tie him up for me and pull off his pants\! This chief's spiked club hasn't seen blood for a long time and is already unbearably hungry\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "Wait\! Please calm down, Chief\! It's not too late to tie me up after I ask you a few questions."

"What are you, kid? You dare to ask my camp leader a question\! Get down\!"

The orc leader was furious. He raised the big knife in his hand and slashed at him\!

Chu Xiaoye swung his sword and sparks splashed everywhere. He actually cut the saber into two\!

"What a sharp sword\!"

Not only was the orc leader not angry, but her face was also filled with surprise. She drooled as she looked at the sword in his hand and said, "Kid, you still dare to resist, right? I'll let you scream miserably later, making you wish you were dead\! Your few elf beauties will scream to death like you\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at him coldly and said, "In a while, let's see who lives a life worse than death\!"

He looked at the fat chief on the elephant's back again and said, "Chief, let me ask you something. Do you know a lion that can fart? A young, handsome, coquettish, and handsome lion?"

The teasing expression of the fat chief sitting on the elephant immediately froze. His body suddenly trembled and he widened his eyes and narrowed them, looking at him in shock.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her expression and was even more certain. He smiled and said, "You like that lion's big smelly fart, right? If I said that I would let out that smelly fart too, and it's even more smelly, more, and more delicious than that lion's fart. Do you believe me?"

The orc leader said angrily, "Bullshit\! Just you… Ah\!"

Unexpectedly, before he could finish speaking, the fat chief kicked him in the face and sent him to the ground. His face was covered in blood, but he hurriedly knelt on the ground and did not dare to speak.

"Who… Who are you?"

The fat chief's voice started to tremble as she looked at the unfamiliar young elf in front of him in bewilderment.

When Chu Xiaoye saw this, he was relieved and very excited. He said, "Guess?"

Then, he smiled and said, "Honorable Chief, although you don't know me, I definitely know you. You like elephants, smoke, and have a serious smoking addiction, right, fat girl?"

The moment this was said, the fat chief's entire body trembled. She let out a scream and jumped down from the elephant's back. She pounced at him excitedly and screamed, "It's you\! It's you\! Fart\! Fart quickly\!"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"
