Chapter 390: Untitled

Callie was dead.

She was cruelly killed not far from the pride's camp and not far away from her companions.

Her skull was smashed, her neck was broken, and her stomach was cut open.

She died exceptionally miserably.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of this lioness and looked at her wide eyes and terrified and distorted face. The miserable appearance of her children on the grass on that night previously surfaced in his mind.

A lion was born to fight.

A lioness lived her life to reproduce and raise offspring.

As for this lioness, her life was so miserable that she did not even leave behind a descendant.

Of course, this was nothing to animals.

There were many worse things than her.

However, to Chu Xiaoye, this matter was definitely not over.

Every member of the pride of the cold father was a witness to his growth. They were his family that he had relied on and lived and died with.

Therefore, he had to take revenge.

No matter how strong the other party was or what kind of existence he was in this forest, he had to let the other party know that the king of the grassland would always be the king, no matter where\!

Chu Xiaoye slowly raised his claws and covered Callie's eyes.

Pit and the two warthogs worked hard to dig holes in the grass at the side. Then, they buried Callie's corpse deeply.

The prey at the side let out cries of pain and despair.

At this moment, the hunger from his body woke the pride up.

Only by eating his fill would he have the strength to take revenge.

From the previous hunting situation, many of the herbivores on the grassland had fled to this forest. They were either advancing, looking for a home again, or settling down and starting to adapt to the environment here.

Chu Xiaoye assigned prey to the pride. He, Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, and Molly enjoyed a huge water buffalo.

Of course, there was also the little human girl with a small appetite.

Blue's family of four was self-sufficient and ate the prey they caught.

In the forest, leopards were easier to survive than lions. Their natural ability to climb trees and sneak attacks could let them live very comfortably here.

However, like the grassland, forests also had cruel competition and inviolable territorial sovereignty.

Although the current Blue was very strong and powerful, after two rounds of blood rain, this ancient forest would also nurture powerful lives and even hide more ancient and terrifying creatures.

Therefore, it was safest to follow the pride.

Furthermore, they had long treated themselves as a part of this pride.

Just like the honey badger and a three-headed warthog.

However, they were different from warthogs. Their abilities and value were much greater.

As for the three warthogs, who could guarantee that they would not eat them in the future when the pride was extremely hungry?

Even Chu Xiaoye could not guarantee it.

Pit was very honest and smart. It had been emphasizing its value. Therefore, every time the pride stopped to rest, he would work hard to dig pits.

Pits had many uses. Their main use was to avoid danger.

Not only could he help the cubs avoid danger, but he could also help himself.

As for Little Mi, his value had already been reflected in the python previously.

As long as he was in the pride, all the venomous snakes were only spicy sticks that were crunchy when chewed.

In this team, only the human girl seemed to be useless.

Her value had yet to be displayed.

However, she received the best love and protection.

Fortunately, she did not eat much.

The little girl was holding a knife and squatting beside Chu Xiaoye, cutting the beef piece by piece. Every piece was very thin.

She placed the beef slices in the broken hollow horn and prepared to gather them to let Chu Xiaoye marinate and dry them for him.

However, just as she filled the empty horn, Chu Xiaoye snatched it with his claw and poured it into his mouth. He swallowed it and threw the horn to the ground roughly.

The little girl looked at him quietly, but she was not angry. She picked up the horns from the ground and prepared to continue cutting the beef.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye slapped her and slapped the bull horn in her hand to the ground. He looked at her coldly, no longer as gentle as before.

The little girl was stunned for a moment. She thought that there was not enough food and that she was not qualified to continue enjoying it.

She lowered her head and picked up the horns on the ground again. Then, she stood up and prepared to retreat to the side.

Indeed, she was the least useful to the pride.

If there was not enough food, she was indeed the least qualified to eat.

If this team had to abandon one or sacrifice one, it would definitely be her.

The little girl knew her limits.

She lowered her head and prepared to walk further away.

However, before she could leave, Chu Xiaoye had already used his sharp golden claws to cut a small piece of beef from the cow's ribs. He placed it on the tip of his claws and handed it to her.

The little girl's dejected expression immediately recovered.

"Thank you."

She extended her small hand and took the piece of beef. She squatted down again and prepared to cut it with a knife.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly extended his claws and pushed the piece of beef into her mouth with all his might.

The little girl widened her eyes and wanted to struggle and refuse, but she saw his fierce gaze and could only open her mouth obediently.

Now, she finally understood.

It was not that this young lion king did not let her eat together, but it did not let her cut it into pieces to gather them. She could only eat it on the spot.

Although she did not know the reason, after the little girl understood, she immediately threw down the bull horn in her hand and pulled out the beef in her mouth. She cut it into a thin piece with a knife and placed it in her mouth.

Indeed, this time, this young lion king did not interrupt her.

Fresh beef had a strong stench. When she chewed it, blood flowed everywhere. However, the little girl no longer felt as uncomfortable as when she first ate beef.

She could even taste sweetness from this piece of fresh beef.

Her appetite was very small, and a small piece of beef filled her stomach.

The huge water buffalo in front of her was soon eaten by a few young lions into a white skeleton.

After everyone was full and left the skeleton, the little girl came close and took out a knife, preparing to scrape off some meat from the bones and crawl into the horns to store them.

However, before she could move, Chu Xiaoye, who was beside her, slapped the bull horn in her hand away again.

"No food is allowed to be stored\! Not at all\!"

This was Chu Xiaoye's current attitude.

Although the little girl did not understand why he was doing this, she was very obedient. After running over and picking up the horns, she walked to his side and sat down. Her body was tilted slightly and she leaned on him, rubbing against his warmth.

The sun soon set.

After eating and drinking their fill, the members of the pride lay together to rest.

The Jerry brothers, Blue Eyes, and the others took the initiative to ask for instructions. They wanted to patrol and stand guard in the surrounding forest, but they were rejected by Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye ordered everyone to rest in place and not go anywhere. Even if it was convenient, they had to make do.

It was not easy to travel at night, let alone split up.

Chu Xiaoye knew that the enemy would appear again.

Under his orders, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Molly, and Catherine climbed up the tree and hid in the dense leaves to rest.

Pit brought the two young cubs and hid in the cave.

After the sky turned dark, this primitive forest was even more sinister and cold.

The cold crescent moon rose to the branch, but it was tightly blocked by the dense leaves and could not shed any light.

The cold wind blew and the leaves rustled.

The little girl leaned against Chu Xiaoye and curled up into a ball. Her two arms hugged his neck tightly, but her beautiful blue eyes were wide open and she could not sleep.

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes and could not sleep either.

The feeling of being abandoned and homeless was not good.

"Crack\!"

A slight noise suddenly came from the distant night.

Chu Xiaoye's ears twitched and he quietly narrowed his eyes.
