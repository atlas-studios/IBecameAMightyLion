Chapter 403: Untitled

The sound came from afar.

It was like the buzz of a bee, but it seemed even louder.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he looked up.

In the black sky, a black mass pressed down like a huge black cloud\!

It was the group of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes\!

Logically speaking, the trees here were tall and the leaves were dense. Even if the Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes were in the sky, they would find it difficult to discover the creatures in the forest, let alone fall with such fanfare and a murderous aura.

Their goal was clearly very clear, and they landed from the sky.

The buzzing immediately sounded like thunder and rumbled\!

Half of the sky was almost covered by the densely packed Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes\!

However, Chu Xiaoye had seen the huge demon mosquito king last time. This time, it did not seem to have appeared.

Seeing the group of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes quickly approaching overhead, Chu Xiaoye immediately faced a great enemy. He immediately growled and let the pride approach him.

He looked up and continued to run forward.

However, just as the Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes landed more than 100 meters above them, they suddenly changed directions and pounced behind them with a buzz.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and turned to look.

The humans who were holding guns and running around in the forest full of bushes and thorns suddenly stopped and looked up. They started to shout in panic.

It seemed that those humans had long known this group of bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes.

As for this group of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes, they were clearly here for them.

Chu Xiaoye realized that the humans chasing behind him seemed to be stronger and taller than ordinary humans. Their movements were as agile as monkeys. Even with guns in hand, they came and went like the wind, walking on the ground in this forest without a path\!

They were definitely not ordinary humans\!

Chu Xiaoye stopped and let the pride continue to run forward.

He climbed up a big tree at the side and looked over. Two golden lights flickered in his eyes, and he could see them exceptionally clearly in the night.

Those humans were wearing black soft armor and strange helmets. Their faces could not be seen. Seeing the group of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes pouncing with a murderous aura, they immediately gathered together and squatted on the ground. They pulled out strange weapons from their backs and aimed them at the sky.

"Boom —"

An explosion\!

The weapons in the hands of those humans suddenly sprayed out green flames and thick smoke\!

The black mass of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes had just pounced close when they were lost in the black smoke and lost their direction. Many Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes were dizzy and fell.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly shocked.

These humans were clearly long prepared. They actually carried such weapons to deal with the Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes. Clearly, they had already fought these Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes and knew their weakness.

Then, why did they come to this primitive forest with guns?

Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of the ferocious tiger and black lion he had encountered previously. Their bodies were branded with the mark of humans.

Could those animals be the test subjects of these humans?

Did these humans come to this primitive forest this time to continue looking for other animal test subjects?

"Buzz…"

There were too many Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes\!

Even though those humans held powerful weapons, they were still unable to kill all the Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes. More and more Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes broke through the black fog and landed on those humans.

Many Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes started to attack from other directions while sticking to the ground.

When those humans gathered, they could only point their weapons at the sky and could not care less about other directions. Even if the humans squatting at the outermost edge could point their weapons at the ground, they could not do it flawlessly\!

The bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes had strong life force and were not afraid of death. They advanced one after another. Before long, they were crawling all over the bodies of those humans.

However, those humans were wearing soft armor and did not show any skin. Even if a sharp blade slashed on them, they could resist.

The sharp mouth of the Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes broke continuously. Then, under the attack of the smoke, they fell to the ground and cried out.

The humans continued to spray smoke as they laughed, looking very pleased.

When Chu Xiaoye saw this scene, an extremely complicated feeling arose in his heart.

The strength of humans still did not change.

Even these mutated Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes could not do anything to them. Their intelligence could always make them stand at the top of the biological chain in any environment.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a low growl suddenly came from the forest beside him\!

Then, a group of strong figures ran over. As they roared like wild beasts, they pounced ferociously at the humans squatting on the ground and started to bite crazily\!

Their eyes were scarlet and looked exceptionally terrifying in the night\!

The group of humans who had been laughing proudly a second ago immediately let out terrified cries. They picked up their guns in panic and started shooting with all their might\!

The group of red-eyed monsters did not seem to be afraid of bullets. Although their bodies were shot, they still bit with all their might. Furthermore, they used their claws to tear off the human helmets and the soft armor on their bodies and continued to bite\!

When the humans' helmets and soft armor were removed and their skin was exposed, the remaining Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes that had yet to die immediately took this opportunity to pounce on them. Their sharp mouths pierced in like daggers\!

"Ah —"

The cries of humans constantly sounded in the forest in the night.

Some red-eyed monsters died completely after their heads were broken by bullets.

In the blink of an eye, most of the thirty-plus humans were pushed to the ground and could not get up again. The remaining humans immediately abandoned their companions and fled in panic.

However, just as they ran for a distance, a few tall animals suddenly jumped out of the dark forest and sent them flying with a bang\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at them. The eyes of the animals were scarlet like antelopes and were extremely familiar. They were extremely similar to the red-eyed monster they had seen in the human village\!

The few humans who were sent flying fell heavily to the ground and could not get up for a long time.

A few red-eyed monsters pounced forward with a roar and tore them into pieces\!

Chu Xiaoye had once seen those Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes attack those red-eyed monsters. Now, he realized that they were working together to deal with humans.

Obviously, the strength of humans terrified these mutated monsters. Only by cooperating could they continue to survive.

Seeing that the humans were quickly eliminated, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay any longer, afraid that he would be discovered by the terrifying red-eyed monsters. He immediately jumped off the tree and left.

Catherine followed behind him silently with a calm gaze and almost no fear.

Chu Xiaoye secretly admired this female cub.

At the same time, he understood why there were very few animals in this dense forest. They had probably fled in fear by the group of humans or those monsters.

He could not stay here for long. He had to leave as soon as possible and find a new territory.

He hoped that he would not encounter humans and those monsters again.

When Chu Xiaoye chased after the team with Catherine, Mixed Fur and Belita had already fainted and their lives were in danger.

The members of the pride were helpless and dejected.

Blue and the female leopard surrounded their daughter, feeling extremely sad.

Such an injury was fatal for animals.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and stopped on a hill. He let Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the others go to the tree to guard and pay attention to the movements at the foot of the mountain.

Just as he was about to walk over to see the wounds on Mixed Fur and Belita, the human little girl suddenly slipped down from the big black bear's back. She pulled out the knife at her waist and walked close to Belita.

Blue, the female leopard, and Belia bared their fangs and let out threatening growls.

Although they were not afraid of this little animal, the sharp thing in this little hand was extremely terrifying, and it was even sharper than the horns and antelopes.

The little girl stopped and hurriedly explained, "Don't be afraid. I won't hurt her. I'm here to help her take out the bullet."

However, other than Chu Xiaoye, no one understood or accepted her good intentions.

Because no one would trust her.

To the entire team, other than being a burden, she was useless.

Belia growled and bared her sharp claws, telling her to scram.

The little girl looked at Chu Xiaoye with a pitiful expression.

She really wanted to help this cute little leopard.

Although she was not sure if she could save her and she had never done this before, she had seen this treatment method before.

If they let the bullet be embedded in the flesh and delayed any further, this leopard and the lion would die.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and walked in front of Belita. He looked at the wound and gestured for Blue and the female leopard to not be nervous and let the little girl try.

Belita's wound was on her butt. That bullet was not fatal.

If the little girl could successfully remove the bullet and he used saliva to disinfect the wound, there should be no problem.

Blue looked at him and rubbed his head gently against his wife, retreating silently.

His sad eyes revealed a hint of hope.

He believed in this young king.

He originally thought that his daughter would definitely die, but now, it seemed that there was still hope.

Belia could only make way.

The little girl hurriedly walked over and rubbed her head gratefully against the golden mane on Chu Xiaoye's neck. Then, she leaned close to the wound on Belita's butt with a grave expression.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left. He walked to Mixed Fur's side and looked carefully before flicking his golden claw.

The sharp golden claws easily pierced the skin near the wound.

Blood flowed out.

"Roar—"

Mixed Fur suddenly woke up from the pain and thought that an enemy had ambushed him. He opened his mouth and bit, but he was slapped to the ground by Chu Xiaoye.

Mixed Fur woke up and turned to look. He endured the pain and did not say another word.

The other members of the pride watched this scene silently from the side. They were shocked and puzzled, as if they were secretly thinking why their king still had to add wounds to Mixed Fur's wounds.

On the other side, the sharp blade in the little girl's hand also cut open the muscles on Belita's wound.

The female leopard felt her heart ache.

Could she really save her daughter this way?
