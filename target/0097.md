Chapter 97: New Life

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye flicked his claws and hurriedly protected Maya. He bared his fangs, his muscles tensed, and his face was ferocious\!

A round head suddenly popped out from the grass and a pair of amber eyes looked at him anxiously and worriedly.

It was Catherine\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and stared at her fiercely, feeling a little embarrassed and angry.

He almost peed his pants\!

If there was a bigger python, he really did not have the confidence to save Maya\!

Catherine was stunned for a moment. Seeing that he was okay, she looked at the python that was dismembered beside her and hurriedly turned around to escape.

She had been following behind and hiding in the bushes in the distance.

However, she suddenly heard his roar and saw that the vegetation here was shaking and rocks were flying everywhere. She knew that something had happened, so she hurriedly ran over and prepared to help.

However, he had clearly resolved it.

But why was he so fierce?

She was just worried about him and wanted to come and help.

Thinking of his fierce appearance just now, Catherine was secretly sad as she walked back.

But soon, she was infatuated again.

He actually tore such a big snake into pieces. He was indeed her idol\!

Brother Ye was great\!

The python was still twisting and rolling in place.

A strong smell of blood filled the air.

Chu Xiaoye immediately left with Maya.

He planned to bring Maya back to the pride's camp. It was definitely much safer there.

However, when she walked down the hill, Maya stopped.

Her stomach hurt and she seemed to be giving birth soon.

Perhaps this was related to the python's entanglement just now\!

She hurriedly turned around and walked towards the rock pile at the side, stumbling into a cave.

Chu Xiaoye could only follow her and guard the surroundings carefully.

He expanded his range and took advantage of the night to search the surroundings, afraid that another python would sneak over.

Suddenly, the cries of hyenas rang out near the python's corpse.

Clearly, hyenas had discovered the python's corpse and were chowing down.

In a season where food was scarce, such a large amount of snake meat was definitely a sumptuous meal\!

Chu Xiaoye regretted not bringing Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei along. He also regretted chasing Catherine away so quickly just now.

Otherwise, they could have helped bring back some flesh.

But now, he definitely did not dare to go too far away from Maya.

If hyenas took this opportunity to approach, the consequences would be unimaginable.

He hid behind a rock on the rubble and pricked up his ears, staring coldly at the top of the hill.

The hyenas' cries became noisier and noisier.

Clearly, the number was growing rapidly.

Even if you killed a group of these animals, another group would soon migrate from elsewhere.

It was impossible to destroy them.

Unless you had the time and energy to run all over the grassland.

Suddenly, a hyena bit a piece of flesh and ran down the hill.

Its rank in its species was low. After snatching the meat, it had to stay away from its companions and quickly swallow it.

Otherwise, it would be snatched away.

It bit the meat and came close to the pile of rocks. It immediately started wolfing it down.

Chu Xiaoye lay behind the rock and held his breath, not moving.

In less than a minute, the hyena devoured the piece of flesh.

Its mouth was filled with blood. It raised its head and looked at its companions who were still snatching the meat. It prepared to go up and see if there was any flesh that was left.

Right at this moment, it suddenly smelled a very special scent.

It lowered its head, and its nostrils fluttered. It followed the scent and slowly walked towards the cave where Maya had given birth.

Soon.

It became excited and quickened its steps\!

Chu Xiaoye hid behind the rock and did not move. He stared at him coldly and quietly flicked his sharp claws.

He did not know if this hyena smelled the scent of blood on Maya's body or if it smelled the scent of Maya's labor.

He only knew that he had to kill this hyena before it cried out\!

It had to be silent\!

If it alarmed the large pack of hyenas, no matter how powerful he was, he could not take care of Maya and the young cubs, who were extremely weak at this moment.

The hyena lowered its head and walked over unguarded.

Chu Xiaoye's muscles were tense. His claws were burning slightly as he stopped breathing. His gaze was cold, as if he was a venomous snake hiding in the dark, preparing to deal a fatal blow\!

On the hill, the hyenas were still snatching the python's flesh.

They split up and occupied various spots, eating ravenously.

No one noticed the hyena's movements\!

When Chu Xiaoye was patrolling previously, he had already wiped away the blood and scent on his body in the grass and mud.

At this moment, there was no wind and there were also rocks concealing them. It could be said that he was hiding flawlessly\!

"Whoosh—"

Just as the hyena was about a meter away from the rock, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and pounced on it\!

The male hyena did not have the time to react before it was pushed to the ground\!

Just as it was about to open its mouth to roar, two rows of sharp teeth sealed its throat with a crack\!

At the same time, a sharp claw reached into its mouth, blocked its mouth, and pierced ruthlessly into the depths of its throat\!

It widened its eyes and opened its mouth. It wanted to close its teeth and bite down fiercely, but it could not use any strength\!

Soon, it closed its eyes.

On the hill, the hyenas were still clamoring for food.

No one realized that one of their companions was lying at the foot of a hill not far away. His throat was bitten by a young cub and he was dead.

After a long time, Chu Xiaoye crawled on the ground and dragged the hyena's corpse down the rubble slowly. He walked into the distance and threw the corpse into a bush.

He did not want the hyenas to smell and find him.

Therefore, when he ambushed the hyena, he tried his best to prevent it from bleeding too much.

When he returned to the rubble where Maya gave birth, the hyenas had already started to leave one after another. No one came to find their lost companion.

The python's corpse was clearly eaten clean as well.

After the hyenas left, Chu Xiaoye approached the cave where Maya gave birth to see the situation.

A low growl suddenly came from the cave\!

Maya bared her fangs and looked at him with a dark and cold gaze, her face filled with ferocity.

Obviously, she had already given birth.

At this moment, if any living creature dared to approach, including the cold father, she would bite with all her might without hesitation\!

Now, she was a mother.

Everything around her was an enemy\!

To not let her misunderstand and be nervous, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to approach again and immediately retreated into the distance.

He lay on the hill and looked at the distant grassland.

A glimmer of light gradually appeared on the horizon.

The pride of the cold father finally welcomed new life.
