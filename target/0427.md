Chapter 427: Untitled

This did not seem to be normal.

Under normal circumstances, bad people would only be judged by the power of justice after they had done evil for a long time and rubbed all the good people.

But now, this lion died before it could even show the face of a bad person.

Wasn't this a little cruel?

Looking at the miserable appearance of the lion being beaten to death by a group, Chu Xiaoye sympathized.

Before leaving, he peeled off the lion's fur and prepared to keep it by his side to mourn.

Regardless of what the other members thought, he knew very well that this fellow had long harbored ill intentions. That front leg was probably bitten off by him to use the ruse of self-harm.

His clumsy acting skills made him look like a clown in front of him.

"Let's go\!"

The pride continued forward, stepping on the ground covered in fallen leaves and looking at the majestic mountain ahead.

Two days later.

They climbed halfway up the mountain and encountered another group of lions.

This pride did not have many members. There were only two lions, six female lions, and five young cubs.

When the two sides met, Chu Xiaoye's side appeared very calm, but the other party was facing a great enemy and was ready for battle. The two lions actually made a move to escape at any time.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not do anything to them or scare them. He left with the pride.

Before long, they encountered a second pride.

The pride was rather huge. There were five lions, more than ten female lions, and some young cubs. Their physiques and spirits looked good.

When the two sides met, they immediately became vigilant of each other.

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and took a few steps forward in excitement, showing a strong desire to fight.

However, the other party was clearly very careful. The lion and the female lions protected the cubs at the back and formed a formation, not leaving the team easily.

The five lions were all strong lions and were not angered by Little Curly Tail's provocation. They stood carefully side by side to protect the lionesses and cubs, advancing and retreating together.

Little Curly Tail found it boring. Just as he was about to provoke them further, he was called back by Chu Xiaoye.

They encountered two groups of lions in succession when crossing this mountain. Clearly, there was something attracting them on the other side of this majestic mountain.

The only thing that could attract lions was food.

Perhaps on the other side of the mountain, a large number of herbivores were gathered.

The herbivores had a high requirement for the environment. If they really gathered there with their families, the bad situation there would definitely not be too bad.

Chu Xiaoye's pride urgently wanted to find a new territory, a new home, and settle down.

Perhaps, there would be an unexpected surprise waiting for them on the other side.

Chu Xiaoye could not wait to continue traveling with the pride.

After traveling for five consecutive days, the members of the pride finally could not hold on anymore. They were all exhausted and hungry.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the mountain peak. He should be able to go up in another day.

If the exhausted and hungry pride encountered a strong enemy, they would definitely be unable to withstand a single blow.

Therefore, no matter how anxious they were, they could not joke with the lives of the pride.

Chu Xiaoye found an open space covered in rocks in the forest and let everyone stop to rest.

He brought Little Curly Tail and the others to walk around the nearby forest, hoping to find some prey.

With his previous experience, he only brought a few young fellows and the six female lions, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and the Jiela sisters. They stayed in place to protect the pride.

As for the Chino brothers, they followed behind Chu Xiaoye.

These two fellows could not fight, but they could still do some manual labor.

Today was a rare sunny day. The sun had yet to set and the mottled sunlight landed in the lush ancient forest. The stars were dotted and jumped on the thick leaves on the ground, like a scene from a fairy tale.

However, there were no princesses, witches, princes, or white horses here. There were only those beasts that did not look good.

There were clearly more wild beasts here.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and did not walk far before he saw a group of strong wild deer.

They were not the only team that took a fancy to this group of wild deer. In the forest not far away, there was also a group of gray wolves that had long been lying in ambush there, waiting for the best opportunity.

The arrival of the pride made the wolf pack nervous and angry, but they were unwilling to give up this beautiful thing that had reached their mouths.

They made a prompt decision and immediately started to move.

Under the lead of the alpha wolf, the wolf pack charged bravely and pounced at the strong wild deers.

The wild deers immediately let out terrified cries and started to flee in panic.

The wolf pack had already surrounded them from all directions. As they chased, they turned around and looked warily at Chu Xiaoye and the other uninvited guests.

More than twenty gray wolves surrounded the five wild deer and started to pounce and bite.

The other wild deer took the opportunity to escape and actually rushed in the direction of the pride's ambush.

It was naturally difficult to refuse a dinner that was delivered to his door.

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed out of the bushes with the pride. In less than a moment, they caught the remaining ten-over wild deer in one fell swoop.

With dinner settled, everyone finally relaxed.

However, the pride's hunting attracted the dissatisfaction of the wolf pack.

In the wolf pack's opinion, they were the first to discover and attack this group of wild deer. Even if they could not leave all the wild deer behind, they would never allow other competitors to snatch food in front of them. Furthermore, they were so brazen\!

The wolf pack bit the five wild deer to death. Then, under the lead of the alpha wolf, they walked towards the pride.

Although their bodies had mutated and become much taller and stronger than before, they still could not compare to lions.

Fortunately, there were many of them. Furthermore, they were extremely intelligent and united.

The unity of wolves was not something that lions and hyenas could compare to. They would even die in battle for a certain member. Furthermore, they were extremely vengeful.

The wolf king was a slightly larger gray wolf with a scar on its forehead. Its sharp gaze was cold and calm. It had already changed from the nervousness and anxiety when it first saw the pride to calm and courage.

They were frequent visitors to this forest. Not only did they have the numerical advantage, but they also had the geographical advantage.

Regardless of victory or defeat, they could protect their tribe from extinction.

Therefore, they dared to find trouble with a group of lions.

However, in the eyes of the pride, this group of gray little fellows was really courting death.

When wolves attacked and prepared to attack, they would not use their roars to increase their aura and courage like lions. They relied on their intelligence, tacit understanding, and the command of the alpha wolf.

The wolf pack came close and was not in a hurry to attack. Instead, they looked coldly and threateningly at the pride and the prey lying on the ground.

They clearly told this group of outsiders that these prey belonged to them.

They would let bygones be bygones if they left prey behind. If they dared to resist, they could only fight.

More than twenty strong gray wolves gathered together, their gazes cold and murderous.

They seemed to be very confident, especially when they saw that the lions were standing in place without moving, neither roaring nor rushing to attack.

Obviously, the lions were already afraid.

In this forest, they were the absolute boss. Even those powerful leopards did not dare to step foot in this place after being taught a lesson by them.

How could this group of newly arrived lions not be afraid when they saw that they had all sorts of advantages?

The alpha wolf brought the wolf pack and took another step forward. He pressed forward step by step, preparing to use his aura to suppress the other party's last courage and determination.

However, these lions still stood in place and did not move. They only looked at them in a daze. They did not leave or show any intention of fighting.

Was he scared silly?

The alpha wolf felt that something was wrong, but it did not know what was wrong.

At this moment, the Chino brothers, who were standing at the front of the pride, could not help but raise their claws and point behind them. Their eyes were filled with pity as they looked at them.

Poor little things, where is your prey?

The alpha wolf seemed to have realized something late. After being stunned for a few seconds, it suddenly turned around and was shocked, shocked, and furious\!

The five wild deer they had just bitten to death were actually being dragged up the tree beside them by the five young lions\!

"Roar\!"

The alpha wolf finally could not help but roar. It immediately returned with the wolf pack and pounced angrily.

"Bam\!"

The prey Chu Xiaoye was biting suddenly fell from the tree. Then, he immediately jumped down the tree and picked up the prey again.

At this moment, the alpha wolf had already rushed over angrily with the wolf pack.

Chu Xiaoye immediately picked up the prey and ran towards the forest in front of him. He also turned around and gave the Chino brothers a look.

The Chino brothers grinned and muttered tacitly in their hearts, Our king is so cunning.

Although he was muttering, he still had to complete the mission.

They immediately started to move the prey on the ground with the five female lions.

The wolf pack was already furious. They seemed to have lost their minds from this humiliation and ran away crazily after Chu Xiaoye.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly, who were on the tree, jumped down with their prey in their mouths and started to follow Chu Xiaoye's orders to help transport the prey back.

As for Catherine, she obviously left with her king like a shadow.

Although Little Curly Tail felt that it was very fun and was very interested in participating in this game of teasing the wolf pack, his brother's orders and responsibility made him tell himself very clearly that the most important thing was to transport the prey back safely.

Everyone was waiting for them at the camp.

As for his brother, they could not catch up to him no matter how fast they were.

This was not just about speed and strength, but also intelligence.

Chu Xiaoye bit the prey and ran in the forest with the wolf pack. Even if there was no airflow from behind, the big gray wolves could not catch up to him.

He could have led the pride and killed these gray wolves, but he did not.

His goal was food and definitely not to kill.

"Whoosh\!"

Seeing that the distance was far enough, Chu Xiaoye stopped running forward and jumped up. He jumped onto a big tree with the prey in his mouth and started eating on the tree.

The wolf pack surrounded the tree, their upper bodies standing upright as they let out angry and hateful roars. They were also drooling like puppies begging for food, causing Chu Xiaoye to sympathize with them.

Chu Xiaoye bit off a piece of internal organs and threw it down.

The two big gray wolves immediately lowered their heads and started fighting.

However, before they could eat it, the alpha wolf immediately rushed over and bit the two big gray wolves away fiercely, glaring at their two companions.

"Idiot\! How can you tolerate such an obvious humiliation? Where's your dignity and pride as wolves?"

The two big gray wolves that were snatching food immediately lowered their heads in shame and retreated.

The alpha wolf raised its head and roared angrily, ordering the wolf pack to surround the tree. Then, it naturally lowered its head and bit the internal organs of the prey on the ground, swallowing them.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was eating with relish on the tree, a familiar figure suddenly jumped over from the tree behind and landed beside him.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at her. He was about to reprimand her for not listening to his orders, but he accidentally licked her with his bloody tongue and said silently, "Eat."

Catherine froze in place with a trace of blood at the corner of her mouth. She was like a stone sculpture and did not move.

The wolves under the tree were even more furious.

Especially the alpha wolf that had just lost its mate. Its eyes were red.
