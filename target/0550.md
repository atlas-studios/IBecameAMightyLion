Chapter 550: Vilis' Justice

At midnight.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly woke everyone up and continued on his way.

At night, wild beasts would appear, but it was definitely much more complete than during the day.

Furthermore, his eyes could penetrate the darkness and see very far. He could discover danger in advance.

If it was just an ordinary beast, Catherine could handle it. If it was an orc, they would hide or take a detour.

At dawn, they hid in the bushes to rest.

At night, they continued to travel.

Three days later, they finally walked out of the grassland safely and entered the undulating mountains and overlapping forests.

Although this mountain range was not on the map of the orc empire, it was even more dangerous.

Because there was no country managing this place and it was bordered by the four great orc empires, there were a large number of dangerous orcs hiding inside, doing all sorts of dirty transactions and transactions. Some forces of the orc empire even participated in it and divided the dark benefits.

"This is the notorious Floralee Mountain. It's said that it was named after a black widow. Grandfather often reminded the merchants of Bingluo City that they were not allowed to step foot here, let alone do business with the people here."

Doya introduced softly with a worried expression.

It was not easy to pass through here safely.

Lanisi said with a grave expression, "I've heard of this place too. It's said that there are people killing, stealing, selling slaves, and eating black food every day. Many missing girls and children in the Orc Kingdom are trading here."

Vilis asked curiously, "Since this place is bordered by the four orc empires, why aren't there any countries occupying it? Or send an army to eliminate the bandits here. Isn't that enough?"

"Shortie, you're thinking too simply."

Although this was the first time Chu Xiaoye had heard of this place, he knew at a thought that the forces here were definitely complicated. There were probably many big forces participating in the four great orc empires and dividing the profits here in the dark. Furthermore, there were too many mountains and the terrain was complicated. It might not be useful to send an army in. It would not be worth it to occupy this place.

Vilis glared at him. "Shut up\! I'm not talking to you\!"

Doya was about to explain when a voice suddenly came from the forest in front of her and was approaching.

Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "Hide\!"

Fortunately, the vegetation was lush and there were many places to hide.

They split into two groups and hid in the two bushes at the side.

Soon, a few strong figures walked over as they spoke.

There were a total of five people, all orcs with horns on their heads.

"Damn it, that bastard Matteo pressed the price too low today. We shouldn't have sold it\! We finally caught this little thing with great difficulty and it looks fresh. It's only twelve or thirteen years old and it's already sold this much. Second Brother, what are you thinking?"

"Stop talking nonsense\! This is his territory. If we don't sell it to him, do we have to cross the mountains and sell it to others? What if others pay a lower price? Since we're here, we naturally can't return empty-handed. Brother is in need of money now. If you can't get back the money, do you believe that Brother will sell your wife?"

"Fourth Brother, forget it. It's okay if we sell it. It's not the first time we're doing business with that bastard. Furthermore, the price is not too low. That little thing's identity is special. We have to sell it quickly. If we're discovered, we'll all be doomed."

"Sigh, what a pity. If I had known that that bastard would pay such a low price, I would have broken down that little girl first before selling her. You don't know how painful it is for me to tolerate such a beautiful girl."

"Hahahaha, Fourth Brother, don't be anxious. There are many chances. Let's go back and find another one. At that time, you can enjoy it first."

The five orcs spoke as they walked past the two bushes.

Right at this moment, Vilis suddenly rushed out of the bushes. With a bang, she pulled out her huge sword and spun. With a whoosh, she cut off the head of an orc.

"There's an ambush\! Run\!"

The other four orcs were terrified when they saw this. They immediately turned around and ran without hesitation.

Vilis' spinning storm had already been activated and her body was sent flying by the huge sword in her hand. With a whoosh, she caught up to the orc at the back and cut off his skull.

"Ah â€”"

The orc let out a miserable scream and continued to run.

After running for more than ten meters, he fell to the ground.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's arrows also shot out.

The two orcs fell to the ground.

Just as Vilis was about to chase after the last orc, a figure suddenly jumped down from the tree. With a silver flash, it actually cut open the orc's stomach\!

The orc's intestines flowed all over the ground, but in his fear, he still continued to run forward. Then, with a bang, he tripped over his intestines and fell to the ground. He twitched a few times and could not get up again.

Catherine landed on the ground and jumped onto the tree again, observing the surroundings vigilantly.

Vilis looked up at her and turned around to return. When she walked in front of the corpse of one of the orcs, she raised the sword in her hand and cut off the orc's lower body with a whoosh\!

The huge sword loli's face was filled with anger. She looked up at Chu Xiaoye and said, "Let's save that girl\!"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He originally wanted to teach her a lesson and tell her not to be so rash next time. Now, seeing her angry and indignant appearance, he could not say anything in his heart.

The girls looked at him and waited for his decision.

"Vilis, we have a mission this time."

Chu Xiaoye paused for a moment and said slowly. Before the huge sword loli could flare up, he hurriedly said, "However, it's only right to help when you see injustice on the road. Let's go and see the situation first. If the conditions allow, we'll save them. If the conditions don't allow and it's too dangerous, we can only give up. Vilis, I have to tell you again. You have to be obedient. If there's anything you want to discuss with me and listen to my decision, understand?"

Vilis gripped the hilt of her sword tightly and turned around with a cold expression, ignoring him.

Chu Xiaoye frowned and said, "Don't throw a tantrum. You just heard Doya and Lanisi say that this place is very dangerous. If you continue to be stubborn, you won't be the only one harmed. Your queen and all of us will also be harmed. You can choose justice, but please don't selfishly risk other people's lives, understand?"

Vilis turned around and looked at him. "As long as you don't call me shorty."

Chu Xiaoye smiled and said, "Alright, Lady Vilis."
