Chapter 242: The Little White Lion's Entanglement

The path was bloody.

The originally spotless snow ground was now covered in blood and broken corpses everywhere.

Under the trampling of the giant rhinoceroses and elephants, the dead enemies turned into meat paste and mixed with the snow on the ground. They could not tell each other.

Even if Chu Xiaoye walked carefully, he still stepped on quite a bit.

He finally walked out of this battlefield and heaved a sigh of relief.

Looking back, the powerful white lion did not follow.

Tilly turned to look at him and Catherine behind him. She was beaming with joy.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and was overjoyed.

Even the rhinoceros bodyguard did not follow.

Soon, they arrived at the forest.

The mixed fur stood on the hill at the edge of the forest. He had long been waiting anxiously.

When he saw them from afar, he immediately ran over with the pride.

There were tigers in the forest and super lions outside the forest. They were terrified and did not sleep for the entire night.

Tilly glanced at them and told them to return to the grassland first.

She would only bring Chu Xiaoye and Catherine back to the snow mountain. As for these fellows, they were not qualified.

The mixed fur lion king stopped not far away and looked at her, not daring to come over again.

Clearly, this once majestic lion king knew how small and lowly he was after seeing the white lion on this snow mountain.

Tilly ignored them and turned to look at Chu Xiaoye. She blinked playfully and walked in another direction.

However, after walking for a distance, she suddenly realized that something was wrong. She turned around and saw that there was nothing behind her. The little lion and the female cub were actually walking in the opposite direction with the group of lions.

That was the direction to return to the grassland\!

Tilly was stunned for a moment before she hurriedly turned around and chased after him, roaring angrily.

Didn't this bastard say that he would go back with her to study his body?

"Roar—"

She roared angrily and blocked their path, glaring at Chu Xiaoye.

Before she could ask, Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked in front of her and slapped her head, causing her to fall to the ground.

Without a bodyguard by his side and his brother following him, the female cub actually dared to be so arrogant in front of him. Wasn't this courting death?

Tilly lay on the ground and looked at him with grievance. Her light blue eyes were filled with tears.

"You're lying to me\! Didn't you say that you wanted to go back with me?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her mockingly.

"Do you really think that This King will believe your nonsense? You want to lure me into a trap and take revenge? Dream on\!"

The reason why he pretended to be interested previously was that with her brother beside her, he naturally had to think of a way to leave quickly.

Now, she was alone and he was naturally not afraid.

"You're despicable\!"

Tilly jumped up in anger\!

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with her. He brought the mixed fur lion king and the others around her and prepared to leave.

The identity of this female cub was not simple. It was better not to tangle with her too much and return to the grassland early.

"Roar—"

Seeing his attitude, Tilly could not help but roar angrily and pounce on him.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and swung his claws.

"Bang\!"

The two feet collided\!

His body trembled and he took a few steps back.

Tilly flew back and landed on the ground. She glared at him with flames shooting out of her eyes and gritted her teeth in anger.

Catherine's gaze turned cold and she stood beside Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at her, telling her to retreat.

The little lioness did not know how to control her strength and would open her stomach at every turn. If she accidentally killed this little white lion, it would be troublesome.

Furthermore, there was no death grudge between them.

Since this little white lion wanted to fight, he wanted to try and see who was the strongest between him, the golden-clawed lion king, and this golden-clawed female lion\!

He narrowed his eyes and looked at her provocatively.

Tilly was furious. She pounced forward again and swung her claws.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the claws she raised. She said they were claws, but she did not show them. She only wanted to slap him.

As a dignified lion, he naturally could not be slapped by this female cub.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly jumped up and raised his claws.

The yellow and white feet slapped each other heavily again.

A huge force came from his feet\!

This male and female young lion landed on the ground at the same time and took a few steps back.

Then, they sprinted again and jumped up.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

They fought five times in a row and were evenly matched.

They tacitly did not show their golden claws.

Catherine stood quietly at the side and looked at the battle that did not belong to a battle with a complicated gaze.

Even the mixed fur lion king could tell that this was not a battle. It was clearly the young couple sparring. They did not even dare to use their claws and teeth, afraid of hurting the other party.

It was boring.

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Tilly and Chu Xiaoye separated again and landed on the ground.

This battle continued for an hour.

Tilly's feet started to feel numb and her breathing started to become heavy.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he still stood in place calmly and looked at her in high spirits, as if he had endless strength.

Such a battle that relied completely on strength was extremely exhausting.

However, he was still full of strength and looked like he could last for a few more hours.

Seeing that he could last so long, the anger in Tilly's heart immediately turned hot. She was even more unwilling to let him go. With a whoosh, she rushed up again\!

Chu Xiaoye had just raised his claws when he saw her jump up. She suddenly put away her claws and hit him with her head. Her eyes were filled with grievance and determination, as if she wanted to die wholeheartedly.

If Chu Xiaoye used the strength he used just now to slap her again, even if he did not shatter her head, he would at least slap her into a plant lion and make her faint on the spot.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye immediately put away his claws and hurriedly jumped to the side to dodge.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, this little white lion still lowered its head and hit hard at the place he was standing\!

In the end, his head hit the hard ground. With a crack, he broke the thick ice and his entire head was inserted.

As for her body, she was stuck outside. Her tail hung down and she did not move or struggle.

He seemed to have fainted.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly ran over and slapped the ground, shattering the ice and saving her.

Tilly lay on the ground with her head covered in snow. She closed her eyes and still did not move.

Chu Xiaoye reached out with his claws and patted her face, her head, and her butt. There was still no reaction.

He stood up and looked at Catherine and the mixed fur lion king, indicating that it had nothing to do with him. She had knocked herself down.

This was fraud\!

Fortunately, they were his subordinates and no one would say anything.

"Let's go."

He turned around and prepared to leave with the team.

As for the little white lion, let her lie down.

Unexpectedly, he had just taken two steps when Tilly suddenly opened her eyes and stood up. She cried out and ran over to lick his tail, looking stupid.

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and faced her, signaling her to scram.

"Roar\!"

Tilly let out a childish cry and leaned in front of him. She lowered her head and opened her mouth. Saliva was still flowing from the corner of her mouth as she crawled into his abdomen, as if she was drinking milk.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly pushed her away and slapped her to the ground, looking at her strangely.

Could it be that the female cub had been knocked silly?

Tilly immediately got down from the ground and charged at him unyieldingly. She cried out as if she was asking for milk.

Chu Xiaoye was embarrassed and angry. He was a male, so where did the milk come from?

"Bam\!"

He slapped her head again, then raised his claws and pointed at Catherine, telling her to find this lioness cub.

Seeing that he was pointing at her, Catherine immediately lowered her head in panic.

She did not…

Tilly still clung to him, looking hungry and waiting to be fed.

Chu Xiaoye was helpless and could only run.

Tilly cried out as she ran as well, looking unwilling to give up until she got milk.

Soon, they left the icy plain and came to the tunnel at the foot of the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye looked back. The little white lion was still following behind and looking at him pitifully.

"Roar—"

He finally could not help but roar angrily, baring his fangs and revealing a threatening gaze.

He really wanted to bite\!

"Roar\!"

Tilly immediately called out and ran towards him excitedly. She drooled as if she had heard her mother calling for her daughter to drink milk. She smiled until her eyes were narrowed and she almost could not see.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and ran.

Crazy people were indeed terrifying. They could not be provoked\!
