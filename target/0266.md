Chapter 266: This King's Genes\!

In this world.

There was no medicine for regret.

In the blink of an eye.

The ten-over black lions all fell to the ground and could not stand up again.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

The pride that had survived the edge of death looked at their backs in shock.

Suddenly, under the lead of the lion, this pride that had nowhere to go actually ran and followed them.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and hesitated for a moment before ignoring her.

When they walked to another grassland, they heard the sounds of killing in the night and the desperate roars of lions.

The lion was fighting with his life. The lionesses protected the cubs and fled in all directions.

The two black lions chased after a mother and son pair and ran over. Just as they ran dozens of meters away, the mother and son pair were pushed to the ground.

The two black lions bit the mother and son.

The lionesses and young cubs could not resist at all and died on the spot.

More female lions and young cubs fell to the ground under the pursuit of the black pride, turning into miserable corpses.

A few black lions saw Chu Xiaoye's team and only hesitated for a moment before turning to leave to chase after the other lionesses and young cubs.

The pride at the back of the team looked at the black figures in the distant night, their eyes filled with hatred and fear.

Molly's eyes also revealed deep hatred, as if she recalled the scene of her tribe being cruelly slaughtered that night.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and continued forward with the team.

Suddenly, a young lion protected the two young cubs and ran over.

Behind them was a strong black lion.

Seeing that the black lion was about to catch up to them, the young lion immediately turned around and roared as it pounced on them.

As for the two young cubs, they continued to run and came in front of Chu Xiaoye's team. However, they were frightened by the huge bodies of the mixed fur male lions and froze in place, trembling.

The young lion was no match for the black lion at all. After a few bites, the black lion pounced onto the ground and bit its throat\!

"Whoosh\!"

A white figure rushed out of the team. Golden light flashed from his right claw and he grabbed half of the black lion's face\!

"Roar\!"

The black lion immediately let out a miserable roar and jumped up.

However, before he could retaliate, Tilly's golden claw grabbed him again and pierced into his head, pulling off half of his skull\!

The black lion's body turned limp and it fell to the ground, instantly dying\!

However, his miserable roar called for more black lions not far away.

"Roar\! The other party might have been a tribe with more males and fewer females.

The combat strength of this tribe was naturally very terrifying.

After all, there were rarely teams with more than ten lions on this grassland. Even teams with five to six lions were rarely seen.

Therefore, they were naturally invincible.

However, the team they saw now seemed to have many lions. Furthermore, the size and aura of six of the lions really made them a little afraid.

"Roarâ€”"

More than twenty black lions stopped five meters away and let out threatening roars, as if they were measuring each other's strength and chances of winning.

One of the black lions suddenly let out a high and long roar, clearly calling for reinforcements.

If Chu Xiaoye continued to tolerate this, more black lions would arrive and their team would fall into an unprecedented crisis.

Once the other party had too many and disrupted their formation, there would definitely be members injured or dead.

Therefore, when the black lion roared for reinforcements, Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision. He immediately roared angrily and rushed up with the young generals.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and flesh splashed\!

He would never show mercy to people who performed actions that threatened his pride\!

He originally wanted to walk on his own and not provoke these black killers. However, since the other party wanted to kill him first, he could not blame him for being cruel\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Golden claws danced and blood splashed\!

He brought Catherine, Tilly, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei and rushed into the black pride to kill crazily\!

More than twenty black lions pounced at them in shock and anger, but they realized that before they could open their mouths to bite, their jaws, faces, and even heads were grabbed by these young lions\!

Broken limbs, chin, head, and blood flew everywhere in the splashing blood, rising and falling\!

In a moment, more than ten black lions fell to the ground. Some could still let out miserable cries, some fainted from the pain, and some died on the spot.

The remaining ten-over black lions were already terrified. They did not dare to stay any longer and immediately fled in panic.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not going to let them go\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flickered and the lion's head landed\!

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

Little Curly Tail's tail was like an iron whip that swept away the fallen leaves. It swept away the black lions that wanted to escape and crawled on the ground. Before they could stand up, Catherine and Mei Mei had already rushed up, opened their stomachs, and bit their spines\!

In the blink of an eye, the twenty-over black lions all fell into a pool of blood and could not stand up again.

The young lion and the two young cubs beside him were frozen in place, looking at this bloody and terrifying scene in shock.

Lars watched with his blood boiling. He was helpless that his body was too thin and his strength was too weak. He did not dare to go forward. He was excited, dejected, and inferior.

The cold father and the female lions were also stunned.

They knew how strong Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were, but they never would have thought that Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, and the little white lion were so strong\!

They originally thought that the strongest in this team should be the largest brothers, Jerry.

Now, it seemed that this was not the case.

Previously, they were still wondering why these big fellows would listen to the golden-haired kid. Now, it seemed that the kid was clearly the most powerful.

What happened during the time he left?

Even his mother, Aisha, could not understand her eldest son anymore.

At this moment, the cold father suddenly felt a sense of superiority. He rudely pushed aside the mixed fur and blue eyes and stood in the middle of them like a short person. However, he raised his head and stuck out his chest, looking askance at the golden-haired kid with a very proud look.

"Look, this King's genes are still very strong\! This unfilial son was raised by this King since young\!"
