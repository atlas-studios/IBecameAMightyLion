Chapter 569: Dinosaur Island

With more than 200 people gathered, the goal was too big.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye knew in his heart that even on this island, it was impossible to use 200 businessmen to defeat more than 1,000 soldiers who were trained all year round.

Even if they won, they would suffer heavy casualties in the end and it would be meaningless.

Therefore, they had to think of other ways.

"Uncle Qin, lend me twenty Qin family members. They have to be healthy and not afraid of death\!"

Chu Xiaoye observed the forest environment and immediately ran to Qin Zhitan's side.

Qin Zhitan was running while panting. He was stunned for a moment when he heard this and said, "What are you going to do?"

Chu Xiaoye did not beat around the bush and said directly, "Our combat strength, weapons, and numbers are inferior to those navies. If we fight like this, we will definitely lose. Therefore, I need twenty people to lure those navies away. Then, your remaining people will immediately return and attack their two military boats. There should not be many people on those two military boats, and we can attack them easily. At that time, you will drive the boats to the shallows and dig holes, aiming your cannon at the island. As long as they return, you will open fire\! Those thousand plus people will definitely lose\!"

Qin Zhitan immediately stopped.

The other members of the Qin family also stopped in their tracks.

Qin Mo, who was beside him, said, "Young Master Chu, what about you?"

Chu Xiaoye said, "I'll bring the twenty people back from the sea, or hide somewhere until the thousand plus navy are defeated. If they catch up to me, I can only fight to the end. Therefore, these twenty people have to be fearless of death and willing to sacrifice for others."

Qin Zhitan did not think much and immediately said, "Nephew Chu, let me do this. I will personally choose twenty Qin family disciples to lure away those pursuers."

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "Uncle Qin, you can't. You can't run at all, and you don't know how to hide in the forest. The pursuers behind are about to catch up. Uncle Qin, don't hesitate anymore. Otherwise, none of us will survive\!"

"Young Master Chu\! I'm willing to go\!"

The first to speak was actually the young man named Qin Ci. He had been furious previously and was preparing to settle scores with Chu Xiaoye.

"Young Master Chu\! I'm willing to go too\! Anyway, my parents are already dead. I'm not afraid of death\!"

"Young Master Chu\! And me\! I run fast. Those bastards will never catch up to me\!"

"And me\!"

Hence, many young descendants of the Qin family raised their hands.

Most of their families had died in the hands of the soldiers. At this moment, they naturally wanted to take revenge.

If they did not sacrifice, everyone in the Qin family would be wiped out.

"Alright\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately chose the tall and long-legged twenty young men and said, "All of you listen to my orders. Let's just run forward and lure away those pursuers. Don't stop fighting. Even if someone falls behind, don't care about him\!"

The twenty young men agreed in unison with fearless expressions.

Chu Xiaoye said to Qin Zhitan and the others, "Run towards the forest on the left immediately. It's best not to break the bushes. There's a river there. Climb into the bushes on the riverbank and don't move at all\! If the enemy is chasing after you, jump into the river and escape\! Quick\!"

Qin Zhitan did not dare to hesitate and immediately ran towards the river on the left with the remaining hundred plus people.

At this moment, the cries of the more than 1,000 soldiers behind him became clearer.

Chu Xiaoye pulled out the sword at his waist and instructed the twenty young men of the Qin family behind him, "Everyone, try your best to split up and break the surrounding bushes. Roar and slow down. When the pursuers catch up, we'll increase our speed."

Lanisi and the others also followed stubbornly beside him.

"Alright\! Let's go\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately ran forward with the others. As he slowed down and ran, he cut the surrounding bushes.

Soon, the pursuers behind them saw them and roared as they chased after them.

"Run\! Run\!"

The twenty young men deliberately shouted as they ran.

In order to make the pursuers not pay attention to the left, Chu Xiaoye landed behind with the elven girls and let Denise and Fei'er shoot backward as they ran.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The archery of the two elven girls was very powerful. With the sound of the bowstring, the Southern Tang Navy fell to the ground one by one.

"Chase\! Chase\!"

The enemies were even more furious. They roared and chased after him, not paying attention to the traces left behind in the forest on the left\!

Luo Fei and the others successfully led the thousand-plus people forward.

After the thousand-plus people left majestically, Qin Zhitan, who was lying in the bushes by the river, immediately got up and returned quickly with the hundred-over people, running towards the sea where the boat was stopped.

As Qin Mo ran, he said worriedly, "Father, what should Young Master Chu and the others do?"

Qin Zhitan's expression was grave as he said, "They should be fine. Let's occupy those two military boats first and wait for them."

Actually, everyone knew that those who lured away the pursuers would probably be sacrificed.

Little Guai was hugged by a strong man and said loudly, "You're all cowards\! Why don't you go instead of letting Brother Chu die? Cowards\!"

The members of the Qin family ran in silence and did not speak.

Soon, they arrived at the sea.

However, they did not rush out of the forest immediately. Instead, they circled to the other side of the stopping boat and used the cover of the rock to quietly go down into the water, then swam over from the side.

Qin Mo and some other people who were not good in water hid on the shore and waited.

There were people left on both military boats, but there were not many of them. There were only twenty or so in total. When the Qin family swam close with Old Wu's crew, a crew member on the deck realized and immediately screamed.

However, it was already too late\!

The people immediately increased their speed, split up, and climbed up from around the two big boats.

The crew on the military ship could not spare enough manpower to resist\!

Soon, the two military boats were filled with the people of the Qin family and Old Wu. They did not have any mercy and killed the twenty-over crew members with hatred and anger in their hearts.

At this moment, Qin Mo and the others boarded the boat from the shallows.

Everyone activated the two military boats and drove them into the shallows, stopping there. Then, they started to pick up their tools and destroy the bottom of the cabin boat.

"Fire\! Attract those navies back. This way, Young Master Chu and the others might still be alive\!"

Someone suggested.

Qin Zhitan thought for a moment and said, "Alright\! Fire\!"

Hence, the two military boats fired cannonballs at the island.

"Boom\! Boom\!"

The cannonball landed on the island and rumbled, causing sparks and mud to fly and destroying the forest.

The entire island was trembling\!

"Roarâ€”"

A terrifying roar suddenly sounded from the valley in the middle of the island\!

Then, a huge black-haired gorilla that was dozens of meters tall roared and walked out of the valley\!

At the same time, more roars came from the valley.

T-rexes, Parasaurolophuses, Baryonyxes, Stegosauruses, Triceratops, Pterodactyls, and other tall dinosaurs ran out of the deep and vast valley, letting out world-shaking roars\!

Chu Xiaoye, who was running in the forest, suddenly saw the huge figure outside the forest\!

"Boom\!"

The ground trembled and the trees swayed\!

The sounds of running and roaring like thunder rolled towards the forest\!
