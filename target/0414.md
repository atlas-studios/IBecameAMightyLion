Chapter 414: Untitled

Belia looked at them in a daze.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine looked at each other in a daze.

Although they did not communicate with each other, they naturally cooperated flawlessly. They were proficient and tacit, as if they had rehearsed it many times.

Thinking of the danger just now, Chu Xiaoye still had a lingering fear.

Thinking of how this female cub had saved him without hesitation just now, a warm current surged in his heart.

He raised his claws and rubbed the lioness cub's head gently. His gratitude was overflowing.

Catherine lowered her head slightly and narrowed her eyes. Her heart was beating rapidly. She was nervous, happy, and docile like an obedient kitten. She no longer looked like the cruel Ripper.

Just as the atmosphere was harmonious, Chu Xiaoye suddenly slapped her head and slapped her to the ground. Then, he glared at her fiercely, warning her not to do this again in the future.

After warning her, Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked to the trap. He looked solemnly at the sharp branches stuck in the ground.

Catherine lay on the ground and looked up at him in shock. She muttered in her heart, "So… so violent."

The branches at the bottom of the trap were trimmed very sharply and inserted very neatly, but they were not something an animal's claws could make.

Although the animals' intelligence had generally increased after the two rains of blood, it was impossible for them to reach this stage.

This trap was not inferior to the traps he had previously created and was even more exquisite.

It was very possible that it was built by humans\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He immediately jumped onto the tree beside him. His eyes flickered with a golden light as he carefully searched the surrounding forest.

If humans appeared in this ancient primitive forest, it would be a disaster for all animals.

Because in front of human guns, any animal's hard fur could not withstand a single blow.

No matter how animals evolved and mutated, humans' advanced intelligence could make them invincible.

They could quickly make restrained equipment and weapons against the characteristics of every animal, just like the soft armor on the bodies of the agile humans previously and the smoking weapons on their backs.

Of course, they were not invincible.

In front of nature, they were no different from these animals. They were also very small and could not withstand a single blow.

"Roar —"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was solemnly searching for movement around him, Belia suddenly let out a soft cry like a cat. Then, she jumped up and went to his side. She started to twist her butt again and rubbed his body passionately.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye was furious and did not show mercy. He slapped her face.

At this time, she still dared to be horny\!

Belia was caught off guard. Her body tilted and she fell from the tree. With a bang, she fell heavily to the ground, landing on her back.

She struggled on the ground a few times and flicked her limbs. She could not stand up, as if she had broken her spine.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly jumped down from the tree and rushed in front of her.

Catherine also got up from the ground and rushed over.

Belia let out a low growl and struggled with all her might, but she still could not get up.

She lay on the ground and looked at Chu Xiaoye pitifully with her amber eyes. She did not blame or resent him. There was only fear and sadness in her eyes.

He seemed to be saying, "Alright, King, I can't stand up again. You can finally get rid of me."

Chu Xiaoye was at a loss. For the first time, he felt guilty and regretful for his violence and temperamental nature.

All along, this female leopard had no ill intentions towards him. It was just pure love and desire for sex. It could be said to be every animal's instinct.

Furthermore, when he fought the black lion back then, the sisters had always fought beside him and lived and died with him. They had never feared death or retreated.

Now, he was annoyed by the humans and took his anger out on her. He hit her off the tree and made her fall like this.

Even if there were no feelings, as the king of this team, he could not feel at ease.

Belia lay on the ground, her amber eyes actually flowing with crystalline tears. No one knew if she was sad about her body or sad that this young lion king had never accepted her from the beginning to the end.

An animal would definitely die if it broke its spine.

Perhaps she already knew that she could no longer stand up and could no longer follow this team down.

Chu Xiaoye felt extremely guilty and did not know how to explain to Blue, his wife, and Belita.

"Roar… Roar…"

Belia looked at him with tears in her eyes and let out a pitiful cry, as if she wanted to be intimate with him before she died.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and walked close. He lay beside her and leaned closely against her body.

Belia opened her limbs with difficulty and hugged him. She buried her head in his neck and cried. She rubbed against him blissfully, her body trembling.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of his saliva.

He knew that his saliva definitely did not have that effect, but perhaps it could reduce her pain and even let her survive even if she could not stand up.

At most, he would bring her to live with him in the future.

When they found a new territory and a new home, they would build a hut for her and let everyone hunt for her.

Her parents and sisters would never give up on her.

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate. He immediately lowered his head and used his claws to press against her neck. He raised her head and started to send saliva into her mouth.

The moment he stuck out his tongue, Belia widened her eyes and was completely stunned. Her entire body could not help but tremble. She was not frightened, but excited.

Catherine stood at the side and narrowed her eyes.

Belia closed her eyes and was very engrossed. She even took the initiative. When she could not help it, she flipped her body and pressed on Chu Xiaoye. She was extremely excited and rubbed against him without minding herself. She was so proud her tail curled up into the sky\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye finally woke up. He flicked his limbs and sent her flying. Then, he jumped up from the ground and cursed in shock and anger.

Of course, cursing was equivalent to roaring in exasperation.

Belia was sent flying into the air by him. Then, she twisted her body and agilely jumped onto a big tree at the side with a whoosh. She grinned and stuck out her tongue like the human girl, laughing loudly.

"I finally succeeded. Hahahaha\!"

"Pui\! Pui\! Pui\! Pui\!"

Chu Xiaoye started to spit on the ground with all his might, but he could not spit out anything. He was embarrassed and furious, like a little girl who had accidentally lost her chastity.
