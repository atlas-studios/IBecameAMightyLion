Chapter 393: Untitled

The night retreated.

When the sun rose, Chu Xiaoye happened to wake up.

The sun shone brightly on the surface of the forest, but it ignored the darkness at the innermost corner.

The ancient forest was still dark and gloomy.

The other members of the pride did not sleep for the night and were nervous.

At this moment, he finally relaxed a little.

When they were on the grassland, the night was their paradise. They liked to hunt, kill, and flaunt their strength at night, displaying their various skills.

Now, the night made them afraid and worried. They did not even dare to sleep.

No one knew when that terrifying enemy would appear and how he would quietly come to their side and kill them.

Callie's tragic death and Little Chino's attack really terrified them.

Finally, at dawn, everyone thought that they could set off. They stood up and stretched, preparing to leave this troublesome place as soon as possible.

However, Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and did not express anything.

The cold father looked up at him, wanting to see his true intentions from this unfilial son's eyes, but he found nothing.

After this series of events, the cold father no longer dared to make decisions on his own and act smart. He no longer doubted and opposed the decision of this unfilial son.

He had to admit that this unfilial son was smarter than him.

This was nothing to be ashamed of. After all, it was his son. It was natural.

The sun gradually rose into the sky.

Chu Xiaoye was still lying on the tree and had no intention of leaving.

The members of the pride looked at each other, but did not dare to urge him. They could only continue to rest in place with puzzled thoughts.

The little girl finally woke up, but she was confused and could not remember what happened last night.

She thought that she had only slept well and had two especially strange dreams.

In her first dream, she vaguely remembered that the king seemed to know how to speak. No, he knew how to write and could communicate with her in language.

How was this possible?

How could a lion understand human language?

It seemed that she still could not forget human things and even dreamed of them.

The second dream was even more magical and absurd.

The king's butt was suddenly on fire, emitting black smoke. It was very terrifying and also carried a terrifying stench that made her tremble even when she thought of it now.

She was suffocated to death.

Fortunately, it was just a dream.

There was no fire here. How could the king's butt be on fire? Furthermore, she had only seen humans fart and never seen lions fart.

She felt that human farts were the most smelly.

The king had always smelled good.

The little girl rubbed her sleepy eyes and got up from the ground. She originally wanted to greet the king on the tree warmly, but seeing that the atmosphere of the pride seemed a little wrong, she did not dare to speak. She could only wave at the tree and say in her heart, "King, good morning."

Chu Xiaoye was a little surprised to see that she was still so friendly and warm to him and did not seem to be afraid at all. Could it be that the little girl liked to eat farts like that little elephant?

This fetish really caught him off guard.

The pride lay on the grass in the forest, as if they treated this place as their territory. They lived their days lazily, waiting for the next hunger and hunting.

Chu Xiaoye knew that there was definitely a pair of eyes staring at him from the depths of the forest, and they would be extremely anxious and angry.

How could he be willing to be occupied by outsiders? As the one and only king of this territory without any natural enemies?

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and pretended to search the surroundings with Little Curly Tail, Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, and Catherine, but he did not go far.

After confirming that the tiger was far away, Chu Xiaoye immediately instructed the three warthogs to start digging pits in the grass around the camp.

The members of the pride of the cold father, the Jiela sisters, and the other lionesses started to help.

They had already understood that this young king wanted to take revenge for Callie, who had died tragically, and kill the cruel attacker completely.

In the evening, the pit had been dug and fallen leaves covered it.

The pit was not deep, but there were many. With the tiger's strength, Chu Xiaoye did not expect these pits to trap the other party. He only hoped that he could let out a little noise when the other party quietly approached.

He did want to take revenge for Callie, but he definitely did not want to see another team member sacrifice.

When the sky was about to turn dark, Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and jumped onto a big tree at the outermost edge of the pride's camp. He climbed to the highest point and hid between the dense leaves.

Catherine, Mei Mei, Little Curly Tail, and Molly climbed up the surrounding trees and paid attention to the movements in the distant forest.

The other members of the pride were as usual. They lay in the grass and dozed off, watching the two young cubs running and playing, but they were extremely nervous.

Chu Xiaoye placed the little girl alone on a big tree to avoid being attacked by the tiger.

After everything was prepared, the sun finally set.

The ancient primitive forest returned to darkness.

On the tree and under the tree, every member waited quietly. They were all paying attention to the wind and grass around them.

Seconds and minutes passed.

The night was even darker.

The members of the pride had never felt that the night was so unbearable.

There was nothing abnormal during the first half of the night.

In the second half of the night, just as the members of the pride were feeling sleepy and gradually relaxed their vigilance, they suddenly heard a light noise in the forest beside them.

Then, the fallen leaves on the ground rustled, as if something was approaching.

The members of the pride immediately pulled themselves together and waited solemnly.

"Whoosh—"

A figure suddenly ran out of the bushes.

Blue Eyes, who was lying nearby, suddenly jumped up and pounced over\!

The other members jumped up and roared angrily, surrounding him.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Molly, and Catherine also jumped down at the first moment and pounced at the figure.

In the end, when Blue Eyes pressed the figure to the ground, everyone was shocked to discover that the thing that suddenly ran out of the bushes was actually a fat wild rabbit.

Furthermore, the wild rabbit's leg was already injured.

Chu Xiaoye, who was about to jump down from the tree, suddenly realized that something was wrong. He looked up and his eyes flickered with golden light. He suddenly saw a pair of cold eyes strangely appear behind the little girl\!

This shock was no small matter\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and spat out a stream of air from behind him. With a whoosh, he pounced at the big tree the little girl was hiding in\!

This was the fastest speed he had reached so far\!

It arrived almost instantly\!

A huge claw suddenly slapped the little girl's head from behind\!

With this claw, even rocks would shatter into pieces, let alone a body of flesh.

However, before the claw could land, Chu Xiaoye had already shot over. With a bang, his entire body hit the black shadow heavily like a cannonball that had been fired\!

The black shadow was sent flying on the spot.

The little girl also cried out in fear and fell from the tree.
