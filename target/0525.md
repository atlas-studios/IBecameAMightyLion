Chapter 525: Lord Night is So Amazing\!

Noisy footsteps came.

No elves were found in the cave where the ferocious tiger rushed out.

Hence, all the orcs gathered towards this cave.

"Be careful that there are ferocious beasts inside again."

With the lesson just now, the orcs did not dare to approach the hole directly.

A few orcs walked forward with torches and roared at the dark cave to chase them away.

After a while, seeing that there was no movement inside, an orc courageously went forward and threw the torch in his hand into the hole.

If there were ferocious beasts inside, they would definitely be frightened and rush out.

"Captain, there doesn't seem to be anything inside."

The orc reported.

"Let's go in and take a look\!"

Since there were no ferocious beasts, the orcs were no longer afraid. They immediately held their weapons and walked towards the cave.

At this moment, Lanisi and the others, who were hiding in the cave, were holding their weapons in the darkness, feeling despair.

There were many orcs outside, and the periphery of this snow forest was probably already surrounded by orcs. They could not escape.

Even if they rushed out of the encirclement of these orcs, where could they escape to?

The bridge was not repaired and the horses had been let out. They had nowhere to run.

When the orcs' footsteps approached the entrance of the cave, Vilis, who was guarding at the front, straightened her body and prepared to rush out.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly got up, pushed the Queen away, and came to her side. He pressed down the sword in her hand and looked at her with his dark eyes. He whispered, "Stay here and don't move. Protect Her Majesty."

Then, he turned to look at the pink-haired girl behind him and said softly, "Are you afraid of death?"

Fei'er's gaze was determined as she said, "No."

"Then, follow me\!"

Chu Xiaoye pulled out his sword and suddenly passed by Vilis and rushed out of the cave. He shouted, "Your Majesty, follow behind me\! Charge\!"

Catherine followed behind him and rushed out.

Fei'er was stunned for a moment before she immediately reacted. She held her bow and rushed out without hesitation.

Lanisi stood up, but Denise pressed her shoulder.

Vilis held her sword and froze there. She looked at the figure that rushed out with trembling eyes. Although she was short, she was stretched and tall by the moonlight.

Before the few orcs who had just walked to the entrance could react, they saw a figure rush out of the cave at lightning speed. With a bang, he used his body to send them flying.

Then, a lion followed.

Then, another tall and beautiful elf girl rushed out.

The first figure that rushed out was still shouting, "Your Majesty\! Follow behind me\! Charge\!"

"Elven Queen\! It's the Elven Queen\! Catch them\!"

The orcs were immediately excited and fought to pounce on the beautiful elf girl.

"Don't hurt the Elven Queen\! The general has to be unharmed\!"

The Orc Captain hurriedly shouted and let the Orc archers put down their bows.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and rushed towards the orc captain who was riding a horse and giving orders at his fastest speed.

Before the orcs blocking in front of him could react, he rushed over like lightning.

Of course, these orcs were not interested in him at all. All the orcs pounced at the "Elven Queen".

Whoever caught this "Elven Queen" first could obtain the highest reward of the general\!

"Whoosh\!"

When he was more than ten meters away, Chu Xiaoye used the speed of his sprint to suddenly jump up and pounce on the orc captain riding on the horse.

The orc captain was shocked to see him so fierce. He hurriedly raised the huge mace in his hand and smashed it forward fiercely.

"Bang\!"

With a loud bang, sparks flew\!

The sword in Chu Xiaoye's hand slashed at the spiked club with great strength. It actually cut the huge spiked club in half and then cut the orc captain's chest\!

The orc captain did not have the time to scream and fell off the horse.

Chu Xiaoye landed on the warhorse, turned around, and rode on the horse's back. He slapped the horse's butt hard with the sword in his hand. The horse neighed and its hooves fluttered. It fled in fear and rushed towards Fei'er, who was surrounded by the orcs\!

The war horse was covered in thick armor and the armor in front of its neck was even covered in sharp thorns. It raised its hooves and charged over unstoppably.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The orcs who had red eyes and wanted to grab the Elven Queen were sent flying.

"Your Majesty, get on the horse\!"

When Chu Xiaoye rushed to Fei'er's side, he immediately bent down and extended his hand. Fei'er grabbed his hand and ran a few steps with him. She jumped gently and jumped lightly onto the horse's back.

Catherine followed closely beside the horse and did not force herself.

The weapons in the orcs' hands were fatal to her.

Chu Xiaoye brought Fei'er and ran on his horse. Soon, he rushed out of the orc's encirclement and headed towards the distant ice and snow forest.

"Chase\! Chase\!"

Seeing that the Elven Queen they had obtained was saved again, the orcs were furious and roared as they chased after her.

Soon, peace returned.

Vilis stuck her head out of the hole and looked at it vigilantly for a while. Then, she said to Lanisi in the hole, "Your Majesty, come out quickly. Let's hide in the cave at the side."

The orcs had just searched the cave at the side. Other than the ferocious tiger, there was nothing else inside.

The ferocious tiger's corpse was still not far from the entrance.

If those orcs returned, they should not enter the cave to search again.

The three elf girls immediately switched to the cave.

Lanisi's expression was dejected. For the first time, she felt so useless and ashamed. Just now, in that critical moment, she only thought of charging out and dying in battle, but she could not think of any solution, let alone think of using herself to exchange for others to live.

As for the youth, he rushed out without hesitation.

The cave was exceptionally quiet.

The three of them thought of the dangerous scene just now in the darkness and the brave figure appeared in their minds.

"Night will definitely be fine."

Lanisi muttered, as if she was comforting the other two girls or herself.

Vilis hugged the huge sword and leaned against the wall, looking out of the cave. "That fellow is very fast and so cunning. The orcs will definitely not be able to catch him."

The huge sword loli was silent for a while before she turned around and looked at the Queen. "Your Majesty, now, I don't object to you marrying him."

Lanisi lowered her head with a sad expression. "Vilis, now, I already feel that I'm not worthy of him. No wonder he despises me. I must be very stupid in his eyes. I'm not worthy of being a queen."

Vilis frowned and said, "Your Majesty, don't underestimate yourself. Your Majesty is not stupid at all. It's just that that fellow is too demonic. Furthermore, he was only a lion to begin with. He has no right to dislike you."

Lanisi smiled bitterly and said, "Even lions are smarter than me, and you're saying that I'm not stupid?"

Just as Vilis was about to speak, footsteps suddenly came from outside.

Her expression changed. She pulled out her sword and guarded the entrance of the cave.

A figure wearing animal skin and messy hair walked over quickly with a sword in hand.

"Your Majesty, the orcs are here\! But there seems to be only one."

Vilis took a few steps towards the entrance of the cave and clenched the sword in her hand. She prepared to wait for the orc to approach the entrance of the cave before suddenly rushing out to kill him.

In the cave, Denise had already aimed her arrow at the entrance.

"Vilis, it's me\!"

Suddenly, the short figure that looked like an orc let out a familiar voice.

"It's Night\!"

Lanisi's face was filled with excitement. She stood up and rushed out.

Chu Xiaoye came to the entrance of the cave and looked at the huge sword loli, who was guarding the entrance with her sword and still had a vigilant expression. "Fei'er and I changed into Orc clothes and cut off their hair and scalp and wore them on our heads. That's why we fled back."

As he spoke, he threw a few more sets of clothes and hair on the ground and urged, "Change into them quickly. The orcs might return again. We have to take advantage of the night and leave this place as soon as possible\!"

At this moment, Fei'er also ran over wearing animal skin and the messy hair of an orc.

She thought that the Queen was still hiding in that cave.

"My nose is more sensitive and I can smell Her Majesty's scent."

Chu Xiaoye explained.

Lanisi immediately changed into the orc's clothes with Vilis and Denise and put the orc's scalp hair on his head. Although it was dripping with blood, he could not care less.

"Where's your lioness cub?"

Vilis asked curiously.

Chu Xiaoye looked outside and said, "On the tree, they're investigating the enemy."

After they were dressed, Chu Xiaoye immediately brought them out of the cave and into the forest.

At this moment, Vilis saw a figure jumping agilely in front of the tree above them like an agile ape.

After walking for a distance, Catherine suddenly stopped and changed directions.

"There are Orcs in front\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately brought the elven girls and changed directions, walking towards the forest on the other side.

Catherine had been looking at the distant forest from the tree. As long as she discovered an orc, she would immediately use her tail to inform them and quickly change directions.

However, sometimes, when there were fewer orcs and they had no choice but to advance in that direction, they could only barge in.

Suddenly, Catherine stopped again and wagged her tail, telling the people below that they had discovered an orc ahead.

They had already changed directions just now. There were Orcs in the forest on both sides and there were many of them. Therefore, they could only barge in forcefully this time.

Vilis pulled out her sword.

Fei'er and Denise drew their arrows and got ready to shoot.

Chu Xiaoye immediately said, "Put away your weapons and pretend to be searching the forest. Walk over directly. Attack when you're close. It's best to let the other party scream. Otherwise, it will alarm the orcs in other directions."

The three female elves immediately put away their weapons.

"Don't be afraid. Follow behind me and walk over quickly."

Chu Xiaoye had already heard the footsteps of the orcs in front of him. He comforted them in a low voice and quickened his steps to walk forward.

Soon, five to six orcs walked over while looking around.

Chu Xiaoye held the sword at his waist and walked over with the four girls. With a rough voice, he was the first to shout, "Have you found the Elven Queen? If you can't find her, no one can think of returning\!"

When the few orcs first saw them, they immediately became vigilant and tightened their grip on their weapons. However, after seeing their attire, they relaxed a little. Just as they were about to ask, they heard the other party take the lead to ask. Furthermore, his tone sounded rather strict, as if he was in a high position.

A tall orc at the front immediately weakened his aura. He immediately lowered his body and said carefully, "I… haven't found her yet."

"Trash\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and walked in front of him quickly. He suddenly pulled out the sword at his waist and cut his neck with a whoosh, actually cutting his head up.

This sudden change not only frightened the orcs opposite them, but also Vilis and the others, who were following behind. They did not know if they should rush up and fight at this moment.

"Trash has no right to live\! This is what the General told me to pass on to you\!"

Chu Xiaoye glared at him. He held the bloody sword and walked towards the few orcs behind.

The few orcs were terrified and froze in place. When they heard him mention the General, their expressions changed and they were terrified. They did not dare to raise their weapons to resist.

"Trash\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised the sword in his hand and cut off the head of another orc.

Then, he said, "The general said that whoever dares to be lazy will have this outcome\!"

The remaining orcs immediately turned pale in fear. They hurriedly knelt on the ground and begged with a sobbing tone, "General… General, please spare us. We only went to poo…"

"Hmph\! The General said that even pooping is not allowed\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised the sword in his hand and cut off the head of a third orc.

The remaining three orcs were so terrified that they went limp. They even threw the weapons in their hands to the ground and trembled as they kowtowed and begged for mercy.

Obviously, that orc general was already famous for his ferocity and everyone was afraid of him.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his sword and cut off the fourth head.

The remaining two orcs still knelt there and kowtowed repeatedly, trembling. They cried and begged, not having the courage to resist.

Chu Xiaoye was already short and the orcs were mostly tall. It was a little difficult to cut their heads off. Now that they were kneeling uniformly with their heads lowered, it was much easier for him to cut their heads off.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye cut off another fifth head.

Standing behind him, Vilis, Lanisi, and the others were completely stunned.

Why did these ferocious orcs look even more stupid than them? They were actually kneeling here neatly with their heads lowered, waiting obediently for their heads to be cut off\!

"Pfft\!"

The last orc had his heart pierced by Chu Xiaoye and died on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye was mainly afraid that he would cut off too many heads and blunt the sword in his hand.

After a few battles, he felt that he could already use the sword in his hand easily. When he swung it, it was much more agile than before and could almost change all sorts of positions quickly.

"Let's go."

He bent down and wiped the blood on the blade on the orc's clothes before inserting it into the sheath and continuing forward.

Catherine jumped to the front again.

The few elven girls hurriedly followed behind him. After walking far away, they still turned around to look at the orc corpses in the forest behind them, feeling that they had yet to react.

No one expected him to kill the tall and strong orcs so easily.

"Lord Night is so powerful. Fei'er admires you so much\!"

Fei'er whispered excitedly.

Lanisi smiled and said, "I admire him too."

Vilis snorted and did not speak again. Clearly, she admired him deep down but would never admit it.

As for Denise, she was still mute.

Suddenly, Catherine, who was jumping above him, immediately stopped on the tree in front of him and wagged her tail quickly.

However, she did not change directions immediately.

"There are many orcs, ahead and to the left and right\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately saw through all her intentions and his expression changed.

It was already too late to change directions.

Unless they turned around.

However, if they turned around, they would be chased by this large group of orcs and have to run forever. Then, the path they had painstakingly walked previously would be wasted. Furthermore, there might be other orcs behind.

Once they were surrounded again, they would be doomed.

The expressions of the female elves were ugly. They looked at him and waited for his decision.

Vilis said anxiously, "Let's go back and return to the previous cave. Anyway, they have already searched. They should not go again."

Chu Xiaoye ignored her. It was impossible to turn around. If they did, not only would all their previous efforts be wasted, their chances of leaving this snow forest would become increasingly slim.

"Continue forward\! Follow behind me, lower your head, and don't speak. Just follow my movements\!"

The footsteps were getting closer and closer. Catherine, who was above him, was becoming more and more anxious. Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and continued forward, then started to run.

When the four elven girls saw this, they could only lower their heads and run behind him, but they were terrified and helpless.

The orcs in front of him soon appeared. There were a lot of them, about hundreds of them. Some were walking, and some were riding warhorses. They surrounded the forest in a fan shape and were rushing over quickly.

When Vilis saw this scene, she was secretly shocked and her face turned pale.

The orc cavalry were strong, fierce, and fast. Even if they wanted to escape, they could not escape.

Chu Xiaoye brought them and continued to run forward.

When the orcs saw them, Chu Xiaoye suddenly shouted anxiously, "Quick\! The Elven Queen is over there\! She killed many of us and is escaping towards the cliff\! Quick\!"

"Bam\!"

He ran in a hurry and suddenly fell to the ground, panting and looking exhausted.

The four elven girls behind him were stunned at first, but then they immediately mimicked him and fell to the ground. They lowered their heads and panted heavily.

When the orc heard this news, they immediately roared and increased their speed.

"You really saw the Elven Queen?"

An orc cavalry at the front asked excitedly.

Chu Xiaoye panted heavily and pointed at the forest behind him. "Over there\! She brought a few guards and killed many of us\! Especially the short elf beside her. She held a sword and was invincible. She cut off the heads of our companions\! We could not stop her at all\!"

"Chase\! Chase\!"

The orcs were extremely excited. The cavalry quickly rushed past Chu Xiaoye and the others. As for the ones walking, they were afraid of falling behind and ran crazily, letting out terrifying roars.

Chu Xiaoye and the others were still lying down, panting. They looked like they were too tired to stand up.

When a team of orcs ran past him, Chu Xiaoye raised his hand and said, "Help me, help us quickly. We can't walk anymore…"

However, the orcs fought to snatch the credit, and no one bothered with him.

Soon, hundreds of orcs roared and ran into the distance in the blink of an eye, running towards the cliff.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and observed for a while before suddenly standing up and saying, "Let's go\!"

The four elven girls hurriedly got up and followed behind him.

Catherine continued to jump above him and looked down to investigate the enemy.

Suddenly, piles of bonfires that had yet to burn appeared in the forest in front of him. A few orcs were sitting there and chatting. They should be the few that had stayed behind in the group of orcs just now.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and walked over quickly.

"Eh, why are you back so soon? Just the few of you?"

One of the orcs saw them and asked in confusion.

Chu Xiaoye held the sword hilt and walked towards them quickly. He reprimanded angrily, "You're being lazy again\!"

With that, the sword light flashed and slashed the neck of the talking orc, cutting off his head.

The other orcs beside him immediately stood up with shocked expressions.

"You…"

Just as one of the orcs was about to speak, Chu Xiaoye stabbed him again and pierced into his heart\!

"You're elves\!"

Another orc reacted and shouted.

The orcs here this time were not women. They were all men and were very strong. However, when he looked at the few of his own kind in front of him, he realized that two of them were very short, and the other three, although taller, were very slender. They looked like men\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Denise's arrow shot over and pierced into his throat\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's arrows quickly shot over.

Vilis' huge sword also spun and slashed over.

Queen Lanisi chased after an escaping orc and caught up to him in a few leaps. She pierced through his back\!

Catherine also jumped up. With a silver flash, she cut open the stomach of an orc and even cut the armor on his body into two\!

The seven to eight orcs guarding here fell into a pool of blood in the blink of an eye and could not make any sound.

"Go\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and immediately left with a few elven girls.

Now, it was as if he was the leader of this team. Every word he said was like an order. No one dared to question or object. Even Vilis, who had always been opposing him, was surprisingly obedient at this moment.

"There's still about two kilometers ahead before we can walk out of the snow forest and enter the mountain."

Lanisi was very familiar with the environment here, but there were orcs everywhere. Now, she could only rely on Catherine, who was above her, to grasp the direction and rely on the young man beside her to bring them out of the encirclement.

"Catherine, move forward directly. Don't change directions again\!"

Chu Xiaoye said to the sky and suddenly realized that there were a few horses tied to the forest beside him. They should belong to the orcs from just now.
