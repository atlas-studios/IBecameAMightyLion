Chapter 576: Little Curly Tail's Wait

The river water dried up.

Even the lush forest disappeared. The cracked ground was filled with desolation, as if it had been burned.

The bark of the towering tree had already disappeared. The branches were withered and there was no more leaves on the branches.

The entire tree had completely lost its life.

The cave under the tree had actually collapsed and was buried in the soil.

Where was the pride?

Chu Xiaoye paced around the familiar and unfamiliar land, looking and smelling, but he could not see any traces left behind by the pride, nor could he smell any familiar scent.

The ground was dark and filled with charred marks left behind by the fire.

Humans had come to this land\!

The evening sun pierced through the muddy sky and landed on this lifeless land, on his tall and stiff body.

He stood under the tree until the sky turned dark.

Catherine stood behind him and accompanied him, motionless like his shadow.

Night fell.

A full moon rose to the bare branches.

The breeze blew and a faint smell of blood drifted in the air.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and walked towards the grassland in the east.

The roar of a lion came from afar, but it sounded unfamiliar.

Chu Xiaoye paused for a moment and still walked over.

A kilometer away.

On the long dry swamp, a young lion was being attacked by another five lions.

The young lion leaned against a big tree and bared its fangs. Its back and face were covered in wounds.

As for the five strong lions opposite, three of them had blood all over their faces. One of their eyeballs was grabbed out and the other's neck was almost bitten off. They looked even more miserable.

The two sides seemed to have fought for a long time. Now, they were panting heavily, baring their fangs and starting to brew for the next battle.

"Roar—"

The lion that had lost an eye was exceptionally furious in the pain. It immediately roared angrily and pounced at the young lion under the tree.

"Whoosh\!"

The young lion suddenly turned around and swung its tail. Its thin whip-like tail actually slapped the one-eyed lion's face, causing its head to tilt and it to fall to the ground\!

"Roar—"

The other four strong lions immediately roared angrily and pounced forward together.

The battle started again.

The young long-tailed lion did not face it head-on. Instead, it turned around and ran, but it did not run fast. The iron tail behind it curled up. When the adult lion behind approached, it suddenly pulled out. With a bang, it slapped the closest adult lion and it fell to the ground in a sorry state, its face covered in blood.

The other adult lions continued to roar and chase.

The young long-tailed lion started to run around the tree. As it ran, it wagged its iron whip-like tail.

After a while, only an adult lion was left chasing relentlessly.

The young lion immediately stopped in its tracks and swung its long tail from behind. With a whoosh, it wrapped around the adult lion's neck. Then, it suddenly swung its butt and sent the adult lion flying, hitting the big tree at the side\!

"Bang\!"

Before the adult lion could react, its brain exploded from the impact and it died\!

On the inner side of this adult lion's hind leg, a number mark left behind by a human appeared\!

Not only were these five adult lions strong, they were also very united and brave. Over the past few days, they had already slaughtered dozens of strong lions.

It was not that they were not strong, but the young lion in front of them was too strong.

The remaining four adult lions saw their companions die, but they did not escape in fear. Instead, they roared angrily and pounced bravely together again.

When the young lion saw this, it immediately turned around and jumped up suddenly. With a whoosh, it actually jumped onto the big tree at the side.

A lion's body was heavy and was not suitable for climbing trees. If he was not careful, he might fall down and his sharp nails might even break. However, the young lion in front of him was as agile as an ape. He instantly jumped up the tree and looked at ease, as if he had climbed up countless times.

The four adult lions immediately ran under the tree, raised their heads, bared their teeth, and roared, provoking each other.

The young lion squatted on it to rest and did not respond.

"Whoosh\!"

Suddenly, one of the adult lions actually jumped up and was five to six meters tall. It suddenly bit the neck of the young lion on the tree\!

Unexpectedly, the young lion was already prepared. It swung its tail and actually wrapped it around the adult lion's neck with a whoosh like lightning. Then, it swung its tail and suddenly threw it into the sky, causing the adult lion to fly out.

"Bang\!"

The adult lion fell heavily to the ground, its head lowered and its neck broken. It widened its eyes and died instantly\!

Just as the three lions were in a daze under the tree, the young lion on the tree suddenly rushed down and pounced on one of the lions, biting his neck\!

The other two lions were about to pounce on them to save them when the young lion actually bit the adult lion's spine and suddenly rolled on the ground, causing the two lions to instantly stop in their tracks, not knowing how to bite.

Right at this moment, the young lion stopped rolling and jumped up from the ground.

As for the adult lion on the ground, its neck had already been bitten off by him. It lay limp on the ground, roaring and struggling with all its might, but could not get up.

At this moment, the remaining two lions finally became afraid and turned to run.

The young lion did not intend to let them go. With a whoosh, he rushed up like lightning and suddenly jumped up. He rode on the back of one of the lions and bit its spine\!

Then, the young lion jumped up again and swung its tail, wrapping it around the hind leg of the last adult lion. It suddenly pulled and pulled it to the ground, dragging it back.

The adult lion was terrified and furious. It turned around and wanted to bite off the tail\!

The young lion swung its tail and sent it flying. It did not fly away, but circled above its head\!

The young lion quickly turned around and the adult lion above him also quickly turned around in midair. The wind beside his ears roared and the surrounding scenery quickly spun.

The adult lion was dizzy and instantly lost the ability to resist.

"Bam\!"

The young lion swung its tail and smashed it heavily to the ground. It suddenly raised its head and smashed down fiercely again. This repeated until the adult lion was smashed until its flesh was blurry and it was long dead. Then, it let go of its tail.

The young lion stood in place, panting heavily.

Right at this moment, many green lights suddenly lit up in the surrounding darkness\!

At the same time, annoying sounds came.

The intense sounds of battle here attracted the attention of the hyenas that were hunting at night nearby\!

The young lion had long experienced those hyenas.

They were stronger, more united and fierce than before, and were full of energy, cunning, and intelligence.

The strong hyena queen was like the colorful big cat that her brother had dug a trap and killed. She had a special aura.

That aura seemed to be… the scent of the humans he had encountered in the past\!

The young lion did not hesitate much and walked towards the tree at the side, preparing to spend the night on the tree. Tomorrow morning, he would go under the withered towering tree to leave his scent.

Every few days, he would go there. First, he would climb up the huge tree and look into the distance. Then, he would leave his scent behind.

He believed that his brother would definitely return.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyena queen was giving orders and surrounded them majestically with more than thirty spotted hyenas.

The corpses of the five lions on the ground would let them eat their fill.

As for the young lion on the tree, if possible, they naturally would not let him go.

"Ahhh —"

Suddenly, the hyenas that were about to rush over to snatch the food were frightened and stopped in their tracks.

They looked in one direction at the same time.

Their queen was still shouting and giving orders a moment ago. At this moment, she suddenly let out a scream and stopped talking.

A terrifying giant figure slowly walked out of the darkness with their strong, brave, intelligent, and beautiful queen in its mouth\!

Their queen was very big and strong, at least twice their size.

However, at this moment, their queen looked so thin and small in the mouth of that huge creature. She was so pitiful that she could not resist at all. She widened her eyes and died.

The hyenas were shocked\! They peed their pants\!

They let out miserable cries and fled in all directions.

As for the young lion hiding on the tree, it widened its eyes and stared blankly at the huge and terrifying figure. It felt familiar and unfamiliar. It wanted to roar, but it did not dare to.
