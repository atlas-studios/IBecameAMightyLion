Chapter 410: Untitled

"Boom —"

A visible sound wave instantly surged forward like a huge tidal wave\!

The giant bats at the front could not react in time and were sent flying like fallen leaves. Their internal organs were shattered and they died\!

The group of giant bats following behind instantly lost all their strength. They immediately staggered in midair and swayed. They could not help but fall\!

The branches trembled and leaves fluttered\!

"Roar—"

The roar was like thunder, long and deafening\!

Even the companions standing behind Chu Xiaoye were dizzy from the shock. Their minds were buzzing and they almost could not stand steadily.

"Chi—"

The Chino brothers, who were standing at the back, peed their pants\!

The legs of six female lions behind the Jiela sisters' turned limp and they fell to the ground.

Only the human girl widened her eyes and covered her ears with her hands. She was not affected at all.

The big black bear beside her was already lying on the ground, trembling.

This was the first time this big black bear had seen this young lion king use such a terrifying skill that could shock a bear to death\!

In the mud pit not far away, the head that had secretly popped out had already retracted at some point in time.

As for the three jaguars that were preparing to die with the pride, because they were the closest to the sound wave and were hit head-on, they had already fallen to the ground. Blood flowed from their mouths and noses and they were struggling in pain.

Chu Xiaoye's lion roar lasted for a full two minutes before he slowly stopped.

The giant bats that were still covering the sky and covering the sun just a moment ago were all lying on the ground now.

The ground in front of him was filled with black giant bats. The closest ones were already dead, and the distant ones were still struggling on the ground in pain. Their internal organs were probably broken and they could not survive.

After resting on the ground for a while, only several dozens of giant bats with strong bodies flew up again.

However, they no longer dared to stay here for a second. After flying up, they immediately tilted and fled in panic. Soon, they disappeared into the dark night sky.

The jaguars were indeed different from regular jaguars and had astonishing physiques. Even in this situation, they quickly recovered some strength and got up shakily.

Chu Xiaoye stood there and looked at them disdainfully, opening his mouth again.

The three jaguars were shocked when they saw this scene. Their bodies trembled and they fell to the ground again with a bang.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly turned around and looked behind. He was about to signal Little Curly Tail and the others to quickly kill the three jaguars.

In the end, he realized that Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Molly, and even Catherine were lying on the ground. They were mimicking the human girl and covering their ears with their claws.

When they saw him open his mouth, they thought that there was still a terrifying lion roar.

Chu Xiaoye was anxious. He immediately glared at them and told them to get up quickly.

The recovery speed of the three jaguars was clearly very fast. If they delayed for a while, they might not have a chance.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine quickly understood his intentions. She immediately jumped up and rushed towards the three jaguars.

Before the three jaguars could get up again, those sharp silver claws pierced into their abdomen and instantly cut open their stomachs\!

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye finally relaxed. His limbs turned limp and he fell to the ground. Not only was he powerless, he was also dizzy and his head hurt.

This was why he did not dare to use the skill Lion's Roar easily.

Although this skill was powerful, not only would it hurt the enemy, it would also hurt the companions beside him. Furthermore, it would hurt him and consume most of his energy.

Once this lion roar ended, if those enemies were too strong and did not suffer fatal damage or were lucky to dodge, he would become a fish on the chopping board and be at their mercy in this extremely short time.

This was equivalent to a magic skill that dealt mass damage. When using it, he would need to expend a lot of mana. After using it, if a fellow suddenly survived or an enemy jumped out from elsewhere, charged over and slashed, he would not be able to resist at all and could only accept his death.

Although his mana recovery was very fast, he needed at least half an hour to rest. During this time, he could only rely on the protection of his companions.

If his companions did not arrive in time, he would die.

Therefore, unless he had no choice, he would never use this skill.

Of course, this was just a last resort.

If he had not decided to use Lion's Roar, he and his companions would have been torn to pieces by the giant bats.

He and his pride did not have any other way to deal with such enemies with sharp teeth, sharp claws, huge numbers, and flying abilities for the time being.

As for smelly farts, they might not be useful against these fellows.

What if when he farted, these giant bats would be happy instead of afraid. What if they liked to eat farts like the fat girl and suddenly rushed over to bite his butt? Wouldn't he die very miserably?

"Roar —"

The three jaguars whose stomachs had been cut open struggled in pain for a while before they died completely.

Catherine hurriedly came to Chu Xiaoye's side and looked at him worriedly.

The other members of the pride also looked over.

The little girl exclaimed, "King, you're so powerful\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately rubbed his body on the ground a few times and forced himself to get up from the ground. He had a calm expression, indicating that he was suddenly lying on the ground because his body was itchy.

Catherine looked at him with her dark eyes, as if she was saying, "Yes, I believe you."

Belia, who was originally full of resentment and preparing to leave, was completely conquered by the world-shaking lion king roar.

She twisted her waist and leaned over, rubbing her body against Chu Xiaoye shamelessly. As she rubbed, she swayed her butt, her eyes wandering and full of charm. Her eyes were filled with obsession. "King, I'm itchy too…"

Chu Xiaoye did not have the strength to slap her again. He took a few steps to the side and turned to growl at Little Curly Tail, asking him to come and help this pitiful female leopard.

Since her skin was itchy, you could slap it with all your might\!

Little Curly Tail immediately wagged his tail excitedly and ran over. He grinned at Belia, indicating that he was willing to serve her. "My iron whip is raring to go\!"

"Whoosh—"

Belia immediately jumped onto the tree.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and turned around to look at the mud pit.

Where did the female cub covered in mud go?
