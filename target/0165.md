Chapter 165: Battle of the Strong\!

"Eh?"

Chu Xiaoye felt that the figure seemed a little familiar.

Just as he was in a daze, the warthog suddenly seized the opportunity and jumped out with a whoosh, instantly escaping without a trace.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it and ignored it.

He stood up from the bushes and chased after the retreating figure.

They had not walked far when they heard the cries of hyenas coming from the forest in front of them.

Chu Xiaoye followed the dense grass and walked over quickly.

In the oak forest in front, five hyenas were surrounding a leopard and letting out fierce and threatening cries.

The leopard was not big and was clearly only a year old. It was the leopard that had left with the gazelle in its mouth just now.

Under normal circumstances, even adult leopards were unwilling to fight hyenas. If they were injured, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Therefore, many times, they would choose to retreat.

Under the threat of the five hyenas, the leopard in front of him still protected its prey. It bared its fangs and did not retreat immediately.

Chu Xiaoye was a little strange. There was a big tree beside him. Why did this leopard not drag its prey up the tree just now?

Could this gazelle be too heavy for it to move?

Just as the five hyenas bared their fangs and walked close, a figure suddenly jumped down from the big tree beside them with a whoosh and pushed the rightmost hyena to the ground, biting its throat\!

This was a male leopard with a strong body and well-defined muscles that were comparable to a lioness\!

When Chu Xiaoye saw this familiar figure, he was stunned. He immediately raised his head and looked at the top of the tree.

However, the tree was empty and there was no sign of the mother and daughter.

This male leopard was the powerful male leopard he had encountered on the way here and by the river in the forest.

At that time, this male leopard had relied on its super strength to bite the giant crocodile to death and defeat the python that had come to snatch its food, leaving a very deep impression on him.

Finally, when crossing the river, he seemed to see this male leopard with the mother and daughter pair.

This fellow actually appeared. That little leopard should be nearby too.

His smelly fart was already unbearable\!

The male leopard's sudden attack frightened the other four hyenas into retreating in panic, and they let out sharp cries while feeling weak inside.

As for their companion, her throat was already bitten by the male leopard. She widened her eyes and did not even have the strength to struggle.

"Roar —"

The young leopard immediately flaunted its might and roared at the four hyenas.

The four hyenas were terrified and furious, but they hesitated.

They were wandering hyenas and did not have any organization or formation. They only wanted to live well.

When they saw this strong and fierce male leopard, they were afraid.

However, they were unwilling to accept this.

"Whoosh—"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out from the grass two meters away from them. It was as fast as lightning and pounced on a hyena. With a crack, it locked its throat\!

It was a female leopard\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The remaining three hyenas were terrified. They did not dare to stay any longer and immediately fled in panic\!

Obviously, they had fallen into a trap.

They thought that there was only one young leopard, but they never would have thought that this leopard, who had always moved alone, would actually ambush them in groups here\!

They fled out of the bushes in fear and towards the distant grassland.

They would never come here again.

When Chu Xiaoye saw the female leopard, his heart skipped a beat and he looked at the other bushes.

Since this female leopard was here, then the little leopard was definitely here too.

However, now that their family was gathered and the male leopard looked like it was not to be trifled with, even if he really wanted to fart and smoke the little leopard, he could only give up.

The young leopard that first appeared seemed to be the child of this leopard couple.

However, she only went over to rub the male leopard's head and body and ignored the female leopard.

Obviously, that female leopard was not her biological mother.

She looked at the female leopard with undisguised disdain.

The male leopard suddenly raised its head and looked at the grass Chu Xiaoye was hiding in.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to have a conflict with this super attacker. He had to conserve his energy for tomorrow's battle.

He turned around and left.

Not long after he left, the female leopard walked to some grass not far away and called out gently.

In the grass, there was a female leopard lying there with her stomach turned and her limbs open. She was sleeping soundly and did not have any vigilance.

At this moment, the male leopard and his eldest daughter, Belia, had already started to eat their prey.

The female leopard turned around and looked at the father and daughter. She did not go over again and lay with her daughter.

The sky soon lit up.

After the heavy rain, the sky was blue as if it had been washed, and the grassland was even more lively.

Chu Xiaoye caught a black antelope and quickly ate it all.

As for the internal organs and head, he threw them to Doya, who could not hunt yet.

Doya learned etiquette from somewhere and always crawled in front of him, carefully expressing her gratitude and respect for him.

The jackal couple and the Chino brothers went out to hunt.

Be it the bushes or the grassland outside, there was plenty of food. He did not have to run too far.

When the sun rose and all sorts of herbivores came out to eat, the grassland was filled with a lively scene. The three female lions that had escaped last night finally returned with the lion for revenge\!

Three adult lions.

One of them was tall, strong, and majestic. It was clearly a local lion here.

The other two were the same size as the Chino brothers, but their fur was smoother and more glossy, and their bodies were stronger.

They were foreign lions, but after being nourished by this grassland, they had become stronger.

These two foreign lions followed respectfully behind the tall and strong black-haired lion. Their size and aura formed a sharp contrast.

One was the king, and the others were his subjects.

However, this king was not the true king of this super pride.

It was only under the orders of the king to bring these two foreign lions to guard this area and patrol the borders to deter other enemies.

Last night, when the three female lions found it, it brought these two foreign lions to chase away a group of hyenas that trespassed their territory. Therefore, it came this morning.

No lion would allow other species to trespass their territory and kill the lionesses of the pride\!

Therefore, at dawn, it brought two foreign lions and rushed over with a murderous aura.

It wanted to see how many heads and claws this daring invader had\!

"Roar—"

A low and angry roar sounded on the grassland illuminated by the morning sun.

The nearby herbivores were terrified and fled in panic.

The black-haired lion brought his two subordinates to this lush forest under the guidance of the three female lions.

In the bushes, the animals that were eating trembled when they heard the lion's roar.

Chu Xiaoye walked out of the bushes and stood in front of a tall Baobab tree. He raised his head and looked at the powerful lion with good genes and an imposing aura under the dazzling sun.

He knew that his life might be in danger today.

However, it concerned whether he could survive here.

Therefore, he had to face it\!

Perhaps the other party looked down on him, or perhaps their territory was too big and only three adult lions came.

This was good too. He did not need to hide and use any tactics.

Then, on the morning after the heavy rain, let's fight fair and square on this grassland that emitted the fragrance of soil\!

The Chino brothers and the jackal couple immediately rushed back when they heard the roar.

When they saw the huge and terrifying black-haired lion, they were terrified.

However, they still stood behind this young figure and did not leave.

They knew that if they fled or failed, there would be no place for them in this grassland.

Therefore, they also had to face it.

The Chino brothers bared their fangs and looked fiercely at the two lions behind the black-haired lion.

Their young king definitely had to deal with the most powerful lion, and the task of dealing with the other two lions naturally landed on them.

They had to use their courage and strength to prove themselves\!

"Roar—"

The three female lions roared angrily and walked over with the three male lions. They looked at Chu Xiaoye with hatred.

They seemed to be saying, "Kid, let's see how you can still jump around today\!"

The black-haired lion's cold gaze first looked at the Chino brothers, thinking that the two female lions were killed by these two invaders.

However, when he saw that the two adult lions were standing behind the young lion, he was clearly stunned. Then, his gaze became a little grave.

Obviously, he realized that this matter was not simple.

If the murderer who killed the two female lions and scared away the three female lions last night was this young lion, he had to think again.

He had gone through hundreds of battles with the lion king and defeated all sorts of experts of all sizes. He would not let his guard down just because this lion was too young.

He was not a brute\!

He stared at the young lion in front of him with a burning gaze and observed his body and aura carefully.

The aura of an expert would naturally be revealed.

However, he was very disappointed.

The young lion in front of him did not have any aura of an expert.

However, the other party's courage and composure really impressed him.

When the distance between the two was only three meters, the black-haired lion stopped and continued to size him up.

At this moment, the animals hiding in the bushes also walked out of the forest and hid in the grass outside the bushes. They widened their eyes and watched this scene curiously.

Belia ate her fill and left the remaining food scraps for the mother and daughter pair who came from the other side of the mountain. Then, she walked to the edge of the bushes and climbed up a big tree to look at the upcoming battle not far away.
