Chapter 36: Revenge\!

Half a month later.

The wounds on the four young cubs healed.

Lars seemed to have forgotten his encounter back then and continued to sleep and play without worries, waiting for food.

He repeated this happy life every day.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to continue practising all sorts of survival skills and continued to build the storage room on the tree.

The first storage room was completed.

The soft and tough branches of the bushes were extremely sturdy on the branches of the Baobab tree.

Even if Mei Mei lay in it, there would be no problem.

Chu Xiaoye placed all the dried prey inside.

Maya also walked out of the sadness of losing her daughter. Other than going out to hunt every day, she had been spending a lot of time with the lion recently.

A lioness who had lost her cubs would always go into heat very quickly.

Then, they would get pregnant again, gave birth to cubs, and continue to nurture them.

Although survival and reproduction were difficult for animals, it was a life every animal had to experience.

Callie seemed to be pregnant.

Every time the female lions went out to hunt, she would be left at home to take care of the cubs.

She ate a lot too.

The cold lion was exceptionally tolerant of her now.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he also keenly realized that the lion's gaze every time he looked at him, Little Curly Tail, and Lars was somewhat thought-provoking.

Especially Lars.

The lion's attitude towards him was exceptionally rough.

Now, Lars was already very big. Other than not growing a lush mane, he already had the body and strength a lion should have.

Of course, judging by his survival skills, he was still a child.

Lars's appetite also seemed to be growing.

Every time he enjoyed prey, not only would he eat a lot, he would also use his roars and sharp claws to chase away the lionesses, wanting to enjoy the best parts of the prey.

This was perhaps an animal's instinct.

The female lions did not mind.

However, his father, the lion, was unwilling to let him do so.

Every time the lion finished enjoying its prey alone, it would leave and let the lionesses and cubs enjoy it.

However, every time Lars wanted to monopolize the best parts of the prey, the lion would rush over and attack him.

In the end, the lion seemed to be addicted.

Every time Lars enjoyed his prey, even if he did not fight for it, he would be slapped a few times by the lion that suddenly rushed over. He could only eat a small amount grievously.

Lars's mother, the lioness with a broken tail, became silent. She did not help him or comfort him.

She seemed to understand something.

Chu Xiaoye could only watch silently every time. He could not change anything.

Because he knew that he and Little Curly Tail would experience the same thing as Lars in the future.

Seventy to eighty percent of young cubs, especially male lions, would not live past two years of age.

Other than a lack of food, they had to face the massacre of other adult lions and the wandering life of being chased out of the pride.

Lars was almost two years old.

He was getting closer and closer to the wandering life of having no one to rely on and surviving alone.

When Chu Xiaoye looked at him, he felt like he was looking at himself.

Hence, he worked hard every day.

He practised his survival skills and tried his best to become stronger.

Of course.

He had to take revenge for Gigi\!

On this night, the moon and stars were sparse.

The female lions, who had eaten their fill, lay in the grass to rest.

The lion went out to patrol the territory.

When Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were asleep, Chu Xiaoye quietly climbed down the tree and entered the forest at the back.

His nose was very sensitive and he could smell the scent left behind by hyenas.

When he was recuperating from his injuries, he had climbed onto a branch at the highest point of the Baobab tree to observe. Hyenas loved to appear in this forest.

Especially at night.

Not only were there many herbivores, there were also some hunters who hunted herbivores.

On the grassland, they dared to snatch any prey that a hunter caught.

Of course.

The hyenas that came out to hunt at night would not mobilize the entire tribe.

Every time there would only be two or three of them. When they were ordered to patrol their borders, they would sneak out to snatch some snacks and have a rare sumptuous meal.

Even if it was just a mouse, they would eat with relish and be in high spirits.

Chu Xiaoye followed the dense bushes and entered the forest.

The forest was very quiet.

Chu Xiaoye hid in the bushes and stopped advancing. His amber eyes stared ahead with a burning gaze.

Ten minutes.

Twenty minutes.

Half an hour passed.

There was still no movement in the forest ahead.

At this moment.

A squirrel climbed down from the tree and pricked up its ears. It looked around warily and then started to pick up fruits on the ground.

"Whoosh\!"

At this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out from the grass beside him. Before the squirrel could react, he bit his neck\!

The squirrel kicked its hind legs quickly and let out squeaking sounds. Soon, it quietened down and did not move.

The figure that suddenly jumped out had grayish-yellow fur that was about the size of a domestic cat. Its two ears were sharp and long, and its mouth was sharp like a fox.

It was about to leave with its prey in its mouth when two hyenas covered in spots suddenly ran over from the forest beside it and let out excited cries.

The fox was shocked and hurriedly changed directions to run towards Chu Xiaoye.

However, it was too small and had a fat squirrel in its mouth. It could not move fast at all.

The two hyenas let out threatening cries and quickly chased after him.

The fox had no choice but to put down the prey that he had painstakingly caught and flee in a hurry.

The two hyenas were extremely pleased with themselves. They called out to its fleeing figure a few more times before walking to the prey and preparing to enjoy dinner.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, the grass beside them suddenly swayed. Then, a figure pounced out like lightning\!

The two hyenas were shocked. They hurriedly bared their fangs and prepared to face the enemy\!

This speed and ambushing technique made them think that it was just a daring leopard.

They were not afraid of leopards\!

However, when Chu Xiaoye's sharp fangs suddenly pierced through the neck of a hyena, they realized that it was a lion\!

Although this lion seemed to be underage, why was his speed and movements, as well as his sneak attack and biting technique, so fierce and terrifying?

Chu Xiaoye bit the neck of a hyena and it fell to the ground\!

As for the other hyena, after its initial fright, it was furious to see that the attacker was actually a cub that smelled like milk. It immediately bared its fangs and pounced ferociously.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye waved his claws and slapped it away\!

At the same time, his sharp claws conveniently scratched a few deep bloody wounds on its head\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The male hyena that was slapped away was shocked and terrified. It did not dare to stay any longer and immediately crawled up, running away with its face covered in blood\!

Chu Xiaoye let go of the hyena in his mouth and looked coldly at its retreating figure.

Then, he followed it.

This was not called letting the dogs return to the mountain.

Instead, it was called letting the dogs find their nests and killing them in one fell swoop\!

At this moment.

Beside the grass that he had hidden at previously, on a big tree, a pair of leopards, a mother and daughter, were lying on a high branch, looking at him in a daze.

This cub was so fierce\!
