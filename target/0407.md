Chapter 407: Untitled

They continued forward.

Chu Xiaoye turned the peeled jaguar skin over and hung it on the back of the pit.

Although the jaguar was already dead, the smell on its body still made Pit tremble in fear.

This fat and strong warthog was trembling and careful as it walked, as if it was afraid of waking the ferocious beast on its back.

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team through the forest and arrived at a swamp.

The air was filled with a rotten stench and a strong smell of blood.

Chu Xiaoye saw the crocodile corpses lying in the swamp at a glance.

The crocodiles lay there in all directions, their heads or abdomen dripping with blood. The blood had yet to freeze completely, and they had clearly just died.

In the swamp pit full of fallen leaves, there was a mess and traces of fighting were everywhere.

Chu Xiaoye counted carefully. More than ten crocodiles had died here, but there were no signs of their flesh being eaten.

To be able to kill crocodiles in the swamp, Chu Xiaoye could only think of the extremely strong jaguar that could appear and disappear unpredictably.

Could it be that jaguars were appearing here again?

However, jaguars usually hunted crocodiles to eat them.

It was a little strange that so many crocodiles were killed but not eaten.

"Coo…"

The sounds of hunger suddenly came from the team behind him.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and then at the crocodile corpses in front of him. Since they were ownerless, it was a waste to leave them here. They would contaminate the air if they rotted. It was better to let them have it.

"Bam\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to bring the team over to enjoy the crocodile corpses, a mud bubble suddenly popped out from the swamp not far away. Then, a head covered in mud popped out and struggled with all its might.

"Roar—"

It was a female lion that was crying for help\!

"Boom\!"

A stream of mud suddenly rushed into the sky\!

Then, a thick crocodile tail flew out of the mud pit beside the head and slapped the mud pit heavily.

However, soon, there was no more movement.

Chu Xiaoye understood.

In the swamp pit, there was a female lion and a crocodile. The two sides seemed to be fighting. Furthermore, it seemed that the battle was about to end.

However, the lioness and crocodiles seemed to be stuck in the thick mud and could not climb out.

Could it be that the female lion was the murderer who killed these ten-over crocodiles?

"Roar—"

The female lion swayed her head and struggled in the mud pit. She called out again, her voice filled with panic and begging.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and thought that they were all of the same species. Furthermore, this feast tonight was all thanks to this lioness. It was natural to save her this time.

At the thought of this, he immediately avoided the mud pit under his feet and jumped over.

Coincidentally, there was a big tree beside him. Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the big tree and swung his sharp golden claws. With a few strokes, he cut off a strong branch and threw it into the mud pit.

Then, he jumped down from the tree and stepped on the end of the branch to fix it.

The head in the mud immediately swayed and approached the branch. Its two front claws grabbed the branch and it started to climb up with difficulty.

This lioness was clearly injured and her movements were very slow and strenuous.

Little Curly Tail immediately ran over and wagged his tail, preparing to help roll the female lion up. However, looking at the female lion's entire body covered in mud and how dirty it looked like a lion, he immediately turned his head to the side to observe the corpse of a crocodile.

The female lion had already become a mud lion. Even her mouth and eyes were covered in mud.

When they climbed up the branch, the female lion looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was at the edge of the pit and was clearly stunned. Then, she lowered her head and crawled with all her might. She finally climbed ashore and fell to the ground, burying her head.

Seeing that she was in such a sorry state, Chu Xiaoye did not care about her attitude. He immediately turned around and called for everyone to come and enjoy the food.

Since he had already saved this female cub, he would have no qualms eating these ten-over crocodiles.

Everyone was already hungry. When they heard his cry, they immediately ran over and started to wolf down the food.

Because this was a swamp and there were mud pits and traps covered by fallen leaves everywhere, Chu Xiaoye told everyone to be careful lest they fell accidentally.

He walked in front of the mud pit where the lionesses had climbed up and stared at the crocodile tail floating on the mud inside. Then, he called Little Curly Tail over and let him drag the crocodiles out with his tail.

From this thick tail, the crocodiles in the mud pit should be much larger than the dead crocodiles on the ground.

Although Little Curly Tail disliked mud, he was very active in his brother's orders.

He immediately walked to the edge of the pit, swung his tail, and wrapped it around the crocodile in the mud pit. Then, he twisted his butt and started to drag it up forcefully.

This crocodile looked quite heavy. Due to the mud, Little Curly Tail was unable to drag it up at once. Instead, he slowly pulled its tail out of the pit.

Just as Little Curly Tail used all his strength, held his breath, and prepared to use a divine dragon tail swing to swing the crocodile in the pit up, the crocodile's motionless thick tail suddenly swung and pulled him towards the mud pit with a whoosh\!

Little Curly Tail was caught off guard. He suddenly let out the breath he was holding and staggered, falling into the mud pit with a bang.

At the same time, the crocodile at the bottom of the pit actually used this force to suddenly jump up from the mud and land on the shore. It swung its tail and slapped Little Curly Tail, who had fallen into the mud\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye, who was originally looking at the little girl and the big black bear, immediately reacted. He jumped up and swung his golden claw. With a whoosh, he slashed at the giant crocodile's tail, causing a series of sparks\!

Although he could not cut this tail, he sent it flying and prevented Little Curly Tail's head from being crushed.

Little Curly Tail reacted quickly. Just as he fell into the mud pit, he swung his tail and wrapped it around the branch. However, because Chu Xiaoye had left, the branch could not be stabilised and he dragged it into the mud pit.

However, Little Curly Tail took this opportunity to move a distance. Just as he was about to sink, he swung his tail again and wrapped it around the tail of the lioness covered in mud on the shore with a whoosh. Then, he suddenly used his strength and swam towards the shore.

The female lion was shocked and furious, but she did not dare to attack. She could only grit her teeth and scratch the ground with her limbs. Her tail was in so much pain that her entire body was trembling and her face was distorted.

Little Curly Tail finally climbed ashore using her tail.

The female lion lay on the ground panting, even weaker than before.

This scene happened in the blink of an eye.

When Mei Mei, Molly, and the others rushed over, Little Curly Tail had already gone ashore safely and was shaking the mud all over his body.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he was fighting the huge crocodile.

Catherine was standing by the mud pit, but she did not care about Little Curly Tail's life or death. She was so cold it was like she was not a companion and her dark eyes were fixed on Chu Xiaoye, who was fighting the crocodile.

Before Chu Xiaoye was in danger, no one went up to help. They only surrounded the giant crocodile.

As the king of the pride, he had to give this little dignity.

Furthermore, although this giant crocodile was huge and fierce, it was clearly not a match for him.

Chu Xiaoye slapped it until it was dizzy and could not see north or south.

It opened its mouth and spun around crazily to bite, but it could not touch a single strand of Chu Xiaoye's fur.

Chu Xiaoye saw a flickering scale and a few deep scratches on the crocodile's back. It should have been left behind by the lioness.

This giant crocodile was clearly injured and was not a threat to him.

"Whoosh\!"

The huge crocodile's thick tail whipped at him like an iron whip.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not dodge again. Instead, he raised his sharp claws and, with a golden flash, attacked\!

"Chi—"

An ear-piercing metallic sound rang out and sparks flew\!

However, Chu Xiaoye's sharp claws still pierced through the hard armor. When the tail hit him, he cut it off\!

Blood sprayed out and the huge crocodile jumped up in pain. It opened its mouth and pounced at him.

Chu Xiaoye decided to test his strength. He stood in place and did not dodge. When the giant crocodile opened its mouth and bared its fangs to pounce on him, he suddenly straightened his upper body and pierced his two claws into the upper and lower jaw of the giant crocodile. Then, he suddenly used his two claws to break out. With a crack, the upper and lower jaw of the giant crocodile was broken\!

"Ah\!"

The little girl riding on the big black bear covered her mouth and cried out in shock. She was frightened by this dangerous scene.

The other members of the pride also held their breaths, feeling extremely nervous.

Catherine's body was slightly arched and she had already revealed her silver claws, looking like she was ready to pounce on him at any time.

"Bang\!"

The huge crocodile fell to the ground, its tail dripping with blood. Its upper and lower jaw drooped and it could not close it again.

It twisted in pain on the ground, turned around, and crawled towards the mud pit, as if it wanted to escape into the mud.

It was not angry, only terrified\!

Chu Xiaoye was a little shocked at its tenacious life force.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Little Curly Tail's tail suddenly jumped over and wrapped around the giant crocodile's broken tail. With a fierce swing, the giant crocodile's huge body suddenly flew up and hit the tree trunk at the side with a bang, dying completely\!

However, Little Curly Tail was not appeased. He continued to swing it and hit another tree\!

Blood immediately splashed and flesh became blurry\!

Although Little Curly Tail's tail was broken, it was still much longer than that of other lions. At this moment, not only was the wound healed, its strength seemed to have increased.

Just as Little Curly Tail was about to continue torturing the corpse, Chu Xiaoye immediately growled and stopped him.

This giant crocodile was powerful. If not for its injuries, it would not have been defeated so easily. The flesh of this crocodile should also contain higher energy than that of ordinary crocodiles.

If he let this kid throw it again, the giant crocodile's corpse would probably turn to dust in a while and it would not even be able to lick it.

After Little Curly Tail put down the crocodile, Chu Xiaoye immediately called for Catherine to eat.

He hoped that this female cub could continue to grow quickly so that she could help him conquer the world and guard the country, becoming his most loyal and capable general\!

Just as everyone was engrossed in eating, the lioness covered in mud quietly raised her head and looked at Chu Xiaoye.
