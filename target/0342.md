Chapter 342: Untitled

 At dawn.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and saw that the golden-haired little girl had already curled up under the tree and fallen asleep.

To be honest, Chu Xiaoye did not know how to deal with this human little girl. Be it driving her away or letting her stay, it was difficult.

If he chased her away, the little girl would probably become a delicacy in the mouths of carnivores before she even walked out of the grassland.

It would be even more absurd to let him stay.

Which lion would mix with a human?

Chu Xiaoye did not think of a solution and could only ignore her and treat her as air, letting her fend for herself.

Before dawn, Aisha had already brought Xi'er, Callie, Maya, and Molly out to hunt.

The scattering of the lions made the herbivores return to the grassland.

The delicious water grass was a delicacy that they could never throw away.

When the sun rose, Aisha returned to the camp with a few female lions and three strong and fat gazelles.

The cold father took one for himself.

Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, and Tilly ate the other two.

When the female lions hunted, they had already eaten one first.

As for the huge Blue Eyes and the rest, they hunted by themselves. With their speed and strength, hunting the herbivores on this grassland was a piece of cake. He did not have to worry about them being hungry.

While the members of the pride of the cold father were biting the antelope meat with relish, the golden-haired little girl cowered under the Baobab tree and looked at them trembling, her blue eyes filled with fear.

Soon, the three gazelles were eaten clean.

Tilly walked in front of the golden-haired little girl and flaunted the pearl on her neck proudly. She would swing her neck from time to time and lower her head to lick it lovingly a few times, as if she had completely forgotten where this pearl came from.

The golden-haired little girl widened her eyes and looked at her, seemingly surprised.

She did not understand why the animals on the grassland were wearing this thing.

Tilly seemed to enjoy her gaze and started to show off more.

However, the golden-haired girl's gaze and attention did not seem to be on her.

When Chu Xiaoye finished eating the gazelle meat, he walked into the bushes and prepared to find the leopard sisters. He told them not to run around for the next few days and to be ready to set off at any time.

Seeing him leave, the golden-haired little girl immediately stood up and followed behind.

She was afraid of the cold father's cold gaze and Little Curly Tail's fierce expression. She was also afraid of the other lions looking at her as if they were looking at the two gazelles.

Chu Xiaoye saw that she followed and ignored her.

Catherine followed behind the golden-haired girl and sized her up curiously. She always felt that her king had a special and contradictory feeling towards this strange little creature.

When Chu Xiaoye walked into the orchard, a fruit flew down and hit his head, but he agilely dodged it.

Then, he suddenly jumped onto a fruit tree beside him. In the blink of an eye, he jumped up to the top of the fruit tree and pressed a figure on the branch.

"Roar… Roar…"

"Big fart\! Bastard\! Bastard\!"

Belita roared and juice flowed from her mouth. She was pressed against the branch and almost broke it.

"Whoosh—"

Belia jumped over from the big tree at the side and landed on a branch above them. She loosened her teeth and smashed a fruit on Chu Xiaoye's head. Then, she took the initiative to climb down from the tree, curled her tail, and looked at him with watery eyes, as if she was begging to be bullied.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and extended his claws to slap Belita under him a few times. Then, he growled and turned to look into the distance. He told the sisters that he would leave in a few days and stay in the forest obediently for the next few days.

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, Belia threw another fruit at Chu Xiaoye's head. She looked at him provocatively, as if she was saying, "I'm not obedient. What do you want? Do you dare to bully me?"

Chu Xiaoye stood up and swung his tail, slapping her butt. He looked up and glared at her, telling her to stop messing around.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her. After getting down from Belita, he climbed down the tree.

The golden-haired little girl was standing under the fruit tree, looking up at him.

After Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree, he looked at her and hesitated for a moment. Then, he extended his claws and pushed a fruit on the ground to her feet.

This little girl had fled for her life yesterday and was terrified the entire way. She did not have the time to eat at all and was probably already hungry.

The little girl looked down at the fruit on the ground and seemed to swallow her saliva. Then, she bent down and picked it up, but she did not know where to start.

Chu Xiaoye walked close and extended his golden claw. He used the sharp tip of his claw to cut open the flesh of the fruit and cut it in half.

Immediately, juice flowed and the fragrance of fruits assaulted his nose.

The golden-haired little girl's eyes lit up as she looked at him and his golden claws in shock.

She did not seem to think that this lion king, who had saved her life, not only had a golden mane and claws, it also seemed to be very smart. He knew what she was thinking at a glance.

Smelling the tempting fragrance of the fruit, the little girl could not help but eat it immediately.

The first bite was very sour, but the second and third mouthfuls adapted to the sour taste and started to have some sweetness.

In a few seconds, the little girl ate the fruit clean.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped onto the fruit tree again and specifically chose two ripe fruits. He put them in his mouth, brought them down, and threw them in front of the little girl.

The little girl looked at him in surprise and gratitude. She hesitated for a moment and carefully extended her snow-white and tender little hand to stroke his head. Seeing that he was not angry, she was extremely happy and continued to eat the fruit. As she ate, she looked at him, her eyes curved into crescents.

Catherine, who was standing not far away, watched this scene in a daze. For some reason, she was a little envious.

"Bam\!"

Belia suddenly jumped down from the fruit tree and bared her fangs at the little girl, deliberately drooling.

The little girl's face turned white. She hurriedly ran to Chu Xiaoye's side and hid behind his mane, looking at this fierce leopard in fear.

Belia growled and looked at Chu Xiaoye in confusion, her face filled with questions.

What was this? Could it be another small pet like that warthog and honey badger?

However, the gaze in this young lion king's eyes was completely wrong.

Belia was a little angry and jealous. She had fawned over him all sorts of times but never received such treatment.

Chu Xiaoye did not explain anything to her and only gave her a warning look. His meaning was obvious. If she dared to hurt this little girl, the consequences would be very serious\!

Nature was cruel, with all sorts of terrifying weather and enemies and illnesses.

With this little girl's age and body, she could never survive here. Without fresh and cooked food and a good environment, she could not survive.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye only protected her as much as possible for the next few days. It could also be considered as finding some comfort for his human soul.

As for what she would do in the future, she could only leave it to fate.
