Chapter 494: Elf Boy

"Clang—"

This time, this baron pulled out the sword that symbolized his honor as a knight from his waist\!

"Scram\!"

His gaze was cold and the sword in his hand made a slashing posture. The striking scar on his face suddenly seemed even more ferocious and sinister.

Kallia was trembling.

There was a deep slap mark on this elf maid's face, and blood was flowing from the corner of her mouth. Her face was extremely pale and she looked very terrified. However, she still opened her arms and blocked in front of this cold baron, not letting him take away Lady Vilis' guest.

Although this guest was only two lions.

"Then, little thing\! I won't be polite\!"

A sharp glint flashed in Olis' eyes. He stopped talking nonsense and swung the sword in his hand, preparing to cut this blind little female servant into two.

However, a figure suddenly jumped out from behind the female elf and pounced at the sword he swung out\!

An ear-splitting buzz sounded and sparks flew\!

The web between Olis' thumb and index finger trembled and the sword in his hand almost fell out.

He could not help but take two steps back and hit the two elven guards behind him.

There were a few clear scratches on the blade of the sword in his hand.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of the fairy maid. The light on his claws was still flickering like flames.

His gaze was cold and murderous.

Obviously, these three elves wanted to take him away and kill him and Catherine.

They did not take the initiative to provoke them, but they suddenly attracted a fatal disaster. This unexpected disaster made him, who was once a lion king, feel exceptionally sullen and angry.

If he still had to hesitate and be soft-hearted in this situation, he was not worthy of being a king\!

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine was already on standby. Seeing the killing intent in his eyes, she immediately circled around to the side and pounced at the two elven guards.

"Clang\!"

When the two elven guards saw this, they hurriedly pulled out the sword at their waists.

However, Catherine was so fast that her sharp silver claws flashed and pierced through the armor on the chest of one of the elves, stabbing into his heart and cutting open his stomach\!

Olis was already frightened by Chu Xiaoye's claw. Seeing this scene, he knew that he could not escape. He immediately roared angrily, swung the sword in his hand, and slashed at the bald lion in front of him.

Chu Xiaoye did not use his direct agility and speed to avoid the sword he swung at him. Instead, he raised his golden claw that was flickering with claws and collided head-on with the sword.

He wanted to test how hard this golden claw flickering with claw light was\!

"Crack\!"

With another collision and sparks flying, the iron sword that Baron Olis had tempered hundreds of times actually broke\!

He held the broken sword and was stunned. He widened his eyes in disbelief.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not give him any chance to breathe.

He pounced forward and pierced his neck with his sharp claws that flickered with a cold light. With a light slash, he cut off his major artery\!

Blood sprayed\!

This battle-hardened Elven Baron's eyes bulged. He opened his mouth and spat out blood. He held the broken sword in one hand and covered his neck with the other. He took a few trembling steps back and sat on the ground.

Then, he fell.

He did not seem to believe that he would die under the claws of a wild beast.

On the other side, Catherine opened the stomach of another elf guard again.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the elf baron and soaked the still flickering golden claw in his blood, wanting to see if he could absorb something.

Right at this moment, he suddenly saw Catherine's pupils shrink. She suddenly roared angrily and pounced at him.

"Chi\!"

A sharp dagger pierced through his neck and through his entire neck\!

Then, the dagger was pulled out and inserted into his abdomen again. At an extremely fast speed, it stabbed three times\!

When Catherine roared and pounced behind him, the attacker had already grabbed his dagger and rolled back, jumping four to five meters away.

Catherine landed behind him, but her body was trembling. She turned around and widened her eyes, looking at him in fear.

Chu Xiaoye's neck was spraying blood and his stomach was spraying blood. His internal organs were about to flow out.

He turned around in shock and looked at the petite attacker with short silver hair.

The elven maid, Kallia, held a dagger covered in blood and knelt on the ground with one knee. The childish and cute expression on her face had long disappeared and was replaced by a malicious and pleased expression.

"Brother Lion, I told you that I can scare people too."

As she spoke, the corner of her mouth curled up, revealing two sharp canine teeth. Her facial features suddenly distorted, and her round and cute face suddenly elongated a little. Her watery big eyes also became narrow\!

In an instant, she turned from an elf girl to an elf boy\!

He was still as beautiful as a painting. His face was exquisite, and his silver hair reached his ears. His ears were sharp, but he no longer had the naive and childish demeanor of a young daughter. His gaze had become sharp and his face had become hard and cold.

At this moment, when he saw his true appearance, Chu Xiaoye, who was bleeding and on the verge of collapse, suddenly trembled and felt his soul tremble.

He widened his eyes and trembled.

It was not pain, despair, or anger, but shock.

He immediately recognized this elf boy with an exquisite face and a sinister smile, or rather, the identity of an elf youth.

It was him\!

No, to be precise, this elf boy was the true him and his true identity here\!

Annie's words echoed in his mind like the evening bell under the setting sun.

At this moment, he finally believed it.

It turned out that this handsome lion king, who had shaken the grassland and lived an unruly life, was really just another person's shadow.

How sad\!

"It seems that you recognized me."

The corners of the elf boy's mouth curled up. He smiled very proudly and beautifully.

He placed the dagger in his hand by his lips, stuck out his tongue, and licked the blood on it. He clicked his tongue and praised, "So my blood outside tastes like this. Not bad, not bad."

He suddenly raised his gaze and looked over again, showing a hint of surprise. "Aren't you going to fall? Are you unwilling, or do you hate me? If I beat you to it and made the first move, you must be very hateful and desperate, right?"

"Roar—"

A miserable roar suddenly sounded\!

Catherine suddenly turned into a bolt of lightning and pounced forward\!

At this moment, her speed was even faster than when his king sprayed air\!

Her eyes were scarlet and her aura surged. Her silver claws ignited with a dark and cold flame that jumped like a ghost flame\!

She was crazy\!

The elf boy's expression changed. He could not dodge in time and hurriedly swung the dagger in his hand\!

Catherine did not intend to dodge at all. When the sharp dagger flashed past her eyes, she had already pounced on the other party and bit his face\!

Two rows of sharp teeth bit in\!

"Ah —"

The elf boy let out an extremely miserable scream. He raised the dagger in his hand and stabbed at Catherine's neck\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

His arm holding the dagger flew out\!

Chu Xiaoye, who had been stabbed four times, suddenly had the strength to pounce over again. He cut off his arm with a claw and opened his bloody mouth, biting through his throat with a crack\!

The elven man widened his eyes and let out a painful chuckle. His body twitched a few times before he died completely\!

At the same time, the strange heat in Chu Xiaoye's body suddenly started to flow crazily.

His body trembled and his vision turned black. He fell on the elf boy's body, his teeth still biting the other party's throat.

The blood spat out from his neck and abdomen dyed with the blood of the elf boy.

Catherine loosened her teeth and looked at him in despair and sorrow.

At this moment, the sun had already set and night had fallen.

A scarlet crescent moon quietly climbed up the branch.
