Chapter 313: The Lion King's Desolation

The morning was bright.

On the tree, Chu Xiaoye opened his eyes lazily and looked down.

Under the tree, the lions were already lying on the ground hungry, sleepy, and lifeless. They no longer had the prestige and pride they had when chasing them previously.

Haas stood on the hill, looking up.

However.

At the foot of the mountain, there was no sign of a female lion.

More than 200 female lions went down the mountain to hunt. Now, a day and night had passed, but not a single female lion had returned.

Haas finally started to feel uneasy.

He was hungry too.

His appetite was greater than that of an ordinary lion.

In this forest, with his strength, he could naturally catch prey easily.

However, he could not leave.

Once he left, all his previous efforts would be wasted.

He continued to tolerate it\!

He believed that there would always be a female lion that would return with her prey.

At least, the female lions he pampered would not abandon him\!

"Roar—"

On the tree, dinner started again.

Little Curly Tail and Catherine jumped back with their prey.

This time, they caught two delicious deer.

The lions under the tree raised their heads and could not help but stand up. They drooled and stared blankly, almost forgetting their current mission. They wanted to kneel and beg.

"Smack\! Smack\!"

Little Curly Tail deliberately made a loud noise when he ate. He took a bite and looked down with a smile.

As for Tilly, she bit off a deer leg and deliberately swayed the fresh deer leg as she ate. From time to time, she would deliberately look like she could not hold on to the deer leg and it was about to fall.

The lions under the tree gathered below her greedily, raising their necks and waiting excitedly.

Even Haas could not help but look up from time to time, looking like he was ready to pounce on her and snatch the food.

However, even after Tilly ate all the food, not a single strand of fur fell.

Then, the necks of the lions stiffened, and they drooled as they lay on the ground. They looked dejected and desperate, and they were on the verge of death. They did not even have the strength to flare up.

"Roar—"

Has finally could not help but roar again.

He suddenly jumped up the tree trunk and actually climbed to the top of the tree extremely agilely with a ferocious and furious expression.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze froze. He immediately jumped onto another big tree at the side with Little Curly Tail and the other two.

Now, this golden-haired lion king had already taken a risk. With its strength, if they fought with their lives, the four of them would definitely lose more than they gain.

Anyway, the outcome was decided. There was no need for them to take the risk of being injured and fight head-on.

As long as he waited, the other party would naturally lose without a fight.

When they jumped onto another tree, the lions under the tree could only stand up lazily and chase after them weakly.

Chu Xiaoye would not underestimate these lions.

Although they looked lazy and weak now and could not withstand a single blow, if the four of them really jumped down the tree and fought them, they would definitely recover their strength immediately.

This was a matter that concerned their lives.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye was not in a hurry to go down the tree and continued to jump on the tree with Little Curly Tail and the others.

Haas jumped and chased after him on the tree.

Those lions were chasing under the tree.

Soon, the lions under the tree were so tired that they were panting and could not run.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to continue jumping with Little Curly Tail and the others, a familiar buzzing sound suddenly came from above.

He looked up and was shocked\!

Dense black dots enveloped over like a black cloud.

It was those extremely ferocious giant mosquitoes\!

Chu Xiaoye knew that he could not escape and could only defend.

Fortunately, he had already found a way to deal with these mosquitoes.

He immediately roared and let Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and Tilly stand beside him.

He was preparing to fart.

Catherine stuck close to his body and narrowed her eyes like a cat under the sun. She was so comfortable that she was dizzy and was about to snore.

As for Tilly, she actually crawled under him while lying on the ground.

Little Curly Tail stood beside him and looked up at the group of giant mosquitoes. His tail swayed gently behind him, looking eager to try.

If he swung his iron tail, not to mention these mosquitoes, even the rain would find it difficult to approach\!

Haas did not seem to know how powerful these giant mosquito killers were. Seeing the four of them stop there, he thought that they could not jump anymore. He was delighted and was about to jump over.

"Buzz…"

Right at this moment, the black mass of mosquitoes landed from the sky with a murderous aura.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to fart, the mosquitoes circled around them and did not attack. They rushed straight at Haas, who was preparing to jump.

When Haas saw this scene, he immediately roared angrily and swung his palm, slapping it ferociously.

They were just a group of mosquitoes, yet they dared to be impudent in front of him, the Golden Fur Lion King. They were courting death\!

"Roar—"

Unexpectedly, a few seconds later, he suddenly roared in fear and quickly crawled under the tree.

As soon as he landed, he quickly rolled on the ground\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The lions under the tree surrounded them and turned around, wagging their tails and slapping the mosquitoes.

The group of giant mosquito killers seemed to be angered and immediately split up, splitting into a few small groups and starting to chase after the lions wagging their tails around them.

Haas' golden fur stood up and his skin flickered with a silver luster. He suddenly trembled and actually shook off the mosquitoes that climbed up his body.

However, he was still dripping with blood and covered in wounds from being bitten.

Just as he was furious and was about to continue slapping these mosquitoes, he suddenly realized that the two subordinates beside him had actually fallen to the ground and quickly turned into two dried corpses\!

As for the mosquitoes lying on their bodies, their bodies suddenly swelled and became larger\!

"Roar—"

The lion's cries rose and fell.

Another few lions fell to the ground. After struggling for dozens of seconds, they quickly turned into dried corpses\!

As for the mosquitoes that had eaten flesh, they had already become the size of turtles and continued to charge towards the other lions with a murderous aura.

Seeing this scene, Haas' blood ran cold and he was terrified\!

He did not dare to stay any longer. He hurriedly roared and ordered everyone to escape. Then, he turned around and fled down the mountain.

Little Curly Tail, who was on the tree, was dumbfounded.

Tilly hid under Chu Xiaoye and shivered.

Seeing that the lions were fleeing in panic, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate. He hurriedly growled and fled from the tree with Little Curly Tail and the other two.

After escaping far, they climbed down the tree and ran down the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye believed that as the size of the giant mosquito killers increased, his smelly farts might find it more difficult to restrain them.

It might even suddenly be useless.

Therefore, they had to escape down the mountain quickly before the mosquito killers noticed them.

Haas' team was seriously injured again.

When he ran out of the forest in a hurry, he turned around and realized that there were only ten or so lions following behind him.

Thinking of how mighty and domineering it was when it came, and then looking at the sorry state it was in now, the golden-haired lion king felt even more miserable.

Out of the three hundred plus members that he had painstakingly gathered, there were only a dozen left.

How tragic.

Other than the dead lions and the lions that had disappeared, where were the female lions?

It was impossible for those more than 200 female lions to all die on this grassland, right?

If he was alive, he wanted to see the lion. If he was dead, he wanted to see the corpse\!

Where was the corpse?

Haas stood on the grassland and looked around in confusion, but he could not see half of the lionesses. He did not even see a corpse.

After the heavy rain, the grass was muddy.

A rainstorm brought them away, washed away their footprints and washed away the smell they left behind.

Haas was unwilling to give up. He searched along the way but still found nothing.

The hunger in his stomach and the dispiritedness of the ten-over lions behind him woke him up.

He had to eat his fill in order to continue searching.

However, this huge grassland was once full of herbivores. Why was there not even one now?

If he could not find food soon, the remaining ten-over lions following behind him would probably leave or never get up again.

Haas brought them for a few more kilometers, but they still could not see any prey.

Only a few rabbits crawled into the cave after seeing them from afar.

Haas stopped in place and thought for a while. He suddenly turned around and looked in the direction of the river.

"Roar—"

He immediately growled and walked towards the river with his ten-over subordinates.

Soon, they came to the river.

The river was also exceptionally cold. No herbivores came to drink water.

The crocodile that was always hiding in the river and preparing to attack the herbivores had disappeared.

Haas was disappointed and uneasy. He could only continue forward along the river.

Finally, he realized that there was a dead hippopotamus lying by the river.

Many vultures surrounded it and ate heartily.

Foxes, wolves, wild dogs, and some small carnivores snatched food again.

As for the hippopotamus, it had long rotted.

In the past, Haas would not even look at this piece of rotten meat. But now, looking at the little animals eating with relish, although he could smell the pungent stench of decay, he was still drooling.

"Roar—"

The ten-over lions behind him could not help but roar angrily and charge over\!

"Coo—Coo—"

The vultures spread their wings and fled.

The other small carnivores also fled.

Although the ten-over lions were hungry and dispirited, they were still very intimidating. They instantly chased away the animals.

They immediately surrounded the rotten hippopotamus corpse and wolfed it down.

The vulture cried out unwillingly not far away.

The wild dog watched helplessly from afar.

Haas lowered his head and walked over.

The bright sun shone and the river water glistened. His golden fur flickered with a charming luster under the light.

It was so striking, so majestic, and filled with charm.

This was a tall, mighty, and extremely beautiful lion king\!

However…

Under the gazes of the little animals, he walked towards the rotten corpse, squeezed open the two lions, and opened his mouth to eat.

"Ugh —"

He had just taken a bite when he felt his stomach churn and wanted to vomit.

However, if he wanted to survive, he had to swallow it\!

He gritted his teeth and swallowed the smelly piece of meat in extreme pain. It was also crawling with maggots.

He held his breath and did not dare to breathe in the rotten smell again. At the same time, he closed his eyes and started eating in an extremely miserable and humiliating manner.

He bit and swallowed.

Soon, he was numb.

Although the hippopotamus was huge, more than half of it had been eaten by the little animals and vultures. The remaining smelly meat was not enough for these lions to fill their stomachs.

With Haas's size and appetite, even half a hippopotamus would find it difficult to fill his stomach.

After a moment.

This rotten hippopotamus corpse turned into a white skeleton.

The ten-over lions were not full.

Haas brought them away and lowered his head, not having the face to look at the gazes of the little animals.

He was a dignified golden-haired lion king, a super lion king that commanded more than three hundred lions. Now, he had ended up like these little things, snatching rotten meat to save his life. It was a shame\!

He swore that he would wash away the humiliation today a hundred times\!

He had to tear that damn kid into pieces\!

No, he had to let the other party eat feces first and humiliate them before tearing them into pieces\!

Although he was eating rotten meat, the hunger in his stomach was finally suppressed.

He recovered his strength and continued forward along the river with the ten-over subordinates.

After eating something, his mind suddenly lit up.

If he was right, the more than 200 female lions should have gone home.

There was no prey here, but his territory had many prey. All sorts of herbivores came and went. They were tall, big, and their flesh was fresh and delicious.

Those female lions must have gone back to hunt.

He believed that he could definitely make a comeback\!

As long as he returned now, what awaited him would be the excited clustered and fawning of the female lions and the tender prey that he could not finish.

Thinking about it, he was drooling.

However, if he wanted to return to the territory, he had to eat again midway. Otherwise, even if he had the strength, the ten-over subordinates behind him could not hold on.

Fortunately, on the evening of the second day, he discovered a few old crocodiles in the river.

These crocodiles were huge and were four to five meters long. Even though they were old, they were still ferocious and strong in the river.

However, she still died miserably under his fists and sharp teeth.

This time, he and the ten-over lions ate their fill. Their stomachs were round and they were about to vomit.

This time, they were full of energy and walked home in high spirits.

On the morning of the third day, they stood on the grassland and finally saw their territory. Furthermore, they saw a group of female lions hunting.

That was their lioness\!

"Roar—"

Haas and the ten-over lions roared excitedly\!

Then, their manes fluttered and they looked majestic as they ran over excitedly.

However.

The female lions stopped in place and looked at them in a daze, as if they did not know each other. After being stunned for a few seconds, they suddenly turned around and ran, letting out anxious alarms.

Haas was stunned. Just as he was about to continue roaring and tell them to not be afraid, when this King returned, the roars of lions suddenly sounded one after another in his territory\!

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

Then, the densely packed lions' manes fluttered as they ran over angrily from all over the territory.

At this moment, Haas suddenly opened his mouth and was stunned to discover that this grassland that had just rained was so green.
