Chapter 534: Attacking Sunset Pass\!

I make the decisions in my territory\!

Just like how Chu Xiaoye had once done whatever he wanted in his territory on the grassland.

Here, Carter was the king.

When he was forcibly brought to the other party's tent by Carter's guard, he finally understood the taste of authority.

"Nice\!"

When he ate the fruit that Princess Carter brought over with her red lips, he praised sincerely.

"I said that I would reward you\!"

When he was tortured, this female general said this.

The rain of blood during the day was exchanged for the surging of the night.

Chu Xiaoye was very hurt.

A day later, the messenger pigeon brought news from the capital.

After knowing what happened at the border, the entire country was shocked\!

After knowing that the two young masters of the Lusni family had died tragically at the border, the entire Lusni family was furious and restless.

After knowing that Geck had committed treason, the king expressed his disbelief and tried his best to appease the current leader of the Lusni family, Prime Minister Glenn, and the princess consort. At the same time, he ordered the princess, Carter, to return to the country immediately and bring the corpses of the insiders and the two young masters back to the capital.

The king wanted to judge it personally.

This was the news on the surface and it soon spread throughout the entire Realm of Kast.

However, secretly, the Lusni family was already urgently contacting all the ministers and dukes loyal to their families, and the king, Robert, had secretly issued many orders and was already working to weaken the control of the Lusni family in the capital.

A storm was brewing.

The calm Kast Kingdom was in chaos\!

Before the messenger sent by the king could arrive, Princess Carter left the border with the twenty thousand troops and swung the army up to the capital.

At this moment, the loyalty of these twenty thousand soldiers to her still had to be tested.

However, three days later, this opportunity came quietly.

When Carter brought the army to Sunset Pass, she was suddenly blocked.

The heavy stone door was tightly closed. The soldiers on the city wall took out their bows and spears and waited solemnly.

The leader of the Sunset Pass, Mocaton, stood on the city wall in military attire. He narrowed his eyes and looked at the twenty thousand troops on the plains below. No matter how Princess Carter sent the soldiers to call for the door to be open, there was no response.

There was no doubt that Mocaton was a henchman of the Lusni family.

This was because his daughter, Letty, had married a young man from the Lusni family. As for the young man, he was currently leading the army in the capital to guard the city gate.

Carter's soldiers rode back and reported the situation on the city wall to the princess.

Carter's face was cold.

Before waving her army to attack, she looked at the elf youth riding a horse beside her.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the soldiers waiting solemnly on the city wall and sized up the thick and tall city wall. He asked, "How many people are guarding this Sunset Pass?"

Carter seemed to know these things like the back of his hand. He blurted out, "There are two thousand in total. They are all battle-hardened orc veterans."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the old city under the setting sun and said, "It's only two thousand, but one man can hold the pass and ten thousand can't open it. The city wall is tall and strong, and there's plenty of food and weapons inside. Even if there were only two thousand people, if we want to break through the city gate, we will suffer heavy losses. Princess, at that time, our twenty thousand people will be greatly injured. The gains do not make up for the losses."

Carter frowned and said, "Then you meanâ€¦"

"Wait."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the gray-haired old general on the city wall and said, "Out of the 2,000 old soldiers, there will always be a few who don't want to be accused of treason. No matter how famous Mocaton is, it was given to him by your Kast Empire. Once he's about to betray the country, the hearts of the people in the city will definitely be unstable. It won't be too late to attack then."

Carter nodded and said with a cold gaze, "I've already brought the siege ladder and the battering ram. At that time, I'll definitely let them see the might of my Carter army\!"

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "Now is not the time to brag. Princess, now, you have to walk close to the city gate and let the soldiers on the city see you. Furthermore, you have to tell them that you're the princess and that you're under orders to bring the army back to the capital. You have the king's orders. Whoever stops you will be a traitor. Furthermore, you have to put the corpse of the traitor, Geck, in front of them and let them see the consequences of treason with their own eyes."

Carter looked at him and suddenly smiled. Then, he reached out and pulled his fair face in front of everyone. He whispered, "Brother Night, you always surprise and reassure me. Of course, there's also satisfaction, like last night."

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched as he looked in front seriously.

"Harmo, bring out Geck's corpse\!"

"Yes, Princess\!"

Hence, Princess Carter brought Geck's corpse and walked in front. Under the escort of the army, they slowly approached the city of Sunset Pass.

Mocaton, who was standing on the city wall, raised his hand and said coldly, "Get ready\!"

The soldiers listened to his orders, loaded their arrows, pulled their bows, and prepared to fight.

"Lord Mocaton\!"

When Princess Carter walked close, she suddenly raised her head and shouted, "I'm Princess Carter. You should know me. Back then, when I accepted the order and came out of seclusion to take over the position of general in the border army, I passed by here\!"

As Princess Carter spoke, she brought Chu Xiaoye and the others out and walked under the city wall.

General Mocaton lowered his head and narrowed his eyes at her. After a while, he said, "Princess Carter, you're a border general. You should be guarding the border with your army now, not appearing here."

Princess Carter said, "Lord Mocaton, I'm under orders to return to the capital. Please open the city gate and let me pass."

Mocaton raised his gaze and looked at the twenty thousand army. "Sorry, Princess, I did not receive an order. You can return to the capital at any time, but you can't bring the border army. Without an order, I can't let them go."

Seeing that the old man did not listen to reason, Carter could only say coldly, "I have already received my father's secret order\! My father ordered me to return to the capital with the army immediately\! Lord Mocaton, are you going to disobey the orders of the king you're loyal to?"

Mocaton looked at her and said, "Princess, please take out His Majesty's secret order. If it's really His Majesty's orders, I'll open the city gate and let you through."

Carter said coldly, "Since it's a secret order, I naturally can't show it to you\! Lord Mocaton, I believe you have also heard the news about what happened at the border. Geck and his younger brother committed treason and committed a heinous crime. They have already been killed by me. Could it be that you're on their side?"

Mocaton said in a low voice, "Your Highness, it is not up to you to decide whether Sir Geck and his brother rebelled or not. The king will judge them personally. You have violated the law by acting first and reporting later. You did not receive the king's order and returned to the capital with the army, which is even more against the rules. I will guard this Sunset Pass and only listen to the king's orders. If you return alone, I will open the door immediately. However, if you want to pass through here with the army, sorry, I can only stop you\!"

"Mocaton\!"

The princess raised her voice and said angrily, "It seems that you are also in cahoots with Geck. You have long submitted to the Bolton Kingdom and wanted to stop my army here. Then, the Bolton Kingdom's army will come and destroy us all, right?"

Before Mocaton could answer, she shouted, "Harmo\! Bring out Geck's corpse\!"

Soon, Geck's body was carried to the bottom of the city and he lifted the white cloth.

"This is the corpse of the traitor, Geck\!"

Carter looked up and said loudly, "You are all warriors of the Kast Empire\! You have once defended your country with your blood and life\! You have resisted countless rebellions and the invasion of the Bolton Kingdom\! You have glory above your heads and your home country in your heart\! Now, are you going to betray your country, your king, and your family like Geck and Mocaton? The traitors will be despised by the world and will be infamous for ten thousand years\! Your descendants will be nailed to the pillar of shame forever, cursed by others, and forever be lowly\!"

On the city wall, the soldiers with bows looked at each other with different expressions.

Mocaton suddenly shouted coldly, "Fire\!"

Carter raised her head and stuck out her chest. Her eyebrows raised as she said angrily, "Who dares\!"

Then, she pointed at Mocaton and shouted, "You old thief\! You have long submitted to the Bolton Kingdom, right? I am the princess of Kast and the general of the border army\! I have once repelled the army of the Bolton Kingdom and snatched back the city that I, Kast, had once lost\! I fought bloody battles with the border soldiers and swore to guard the border and not let the enemy take a step forward\! I threw my head and blood for the country and the people and never cared about my life\! I am glorious\! I have no crime, but you want to shoot me now\! If this is not guilt and not treason, then what is it?"

As she spoke, Chu Xiaoye taught her in a low voice.

Her impassioned, indignant, and righteous words immediately weakened the soldiers on the city wall and shocked them.

"Fire\! Fire\!"

Mocaton shouted again, then walked to the side of a soldier and snatched the bow in the soldier's hand. He pulled the bowstring full and aimed at the bottom. With a whoosh, the arrow shot out.

However, just as his arrow flew out of the city wall, it was broken in half by an arrow that flew away and fell from above.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and said in surprise, "Denise, do you have a chance?"

Denise looked up and said calmly, "He's very careful. Only his helmet is revealed. His face will occasionally show, but it's always fleeting. There's not much chance."

"Mocaton\! You traitor\! I'm the princess\! What crime do I have that you want to kill me?"

Carter continued to shout at the top.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly said in a low voice, "Tell the higher-ups that the Bolton Kingdom's army is pressing on the borders and is about to invade. It must be that Mocaton colluded with the other party and leaked the news."

Carter suddenly pointed above and said angrily, "Mocaton\! I have already obtained evidence that you colluded with the Bolton Kingdom\! Now, just as I left the border, the Bolton Kingdom's army suddenly gathered at the border and is about to invade my country's borders\! This is clearly you reporting to the Bolton Kingdom\! Why aren't you admitting it? You and Geck tried to lead the Bolton Kingdom's army to invade my country. You betrayed the country and are guilty of a heinous crime\! Quickly open the city gate, bow your head, and admit your crimes. Come with me to the capital to see His Majesty\!"

"What? The Bolton Kingdom's army has already gathered at the border?"

"Didn't you hear a few days ago that their army had already left? Could it be that they deliberately released news to make us relax our vigilance?"

When the soldiers on the city wall heard this news, their faces were filled with shock and they looked at their general.

Mocaton's face was red as he said angrily, "Shoot\! I order you to shoot\! Shoot them to death\!"

The old general, who had always been calm and composed, was suddenly flustered and exasperated.

Although he knew that this was a false accusation, he was still guilty because he did have selfish motives. He wanted to help the Lusni family stop Princess Carter's army and even kill her.

Strictly speaking, he had indeed committed the crime of treason.

For an old general at his age who had guarded a border city for his entire life and was filled with honor, this matter was indeed a little against his conscience. He was ashamed and flustered.

He wanted to quickly kill this princess who was constantly using words to provoke him and provoke his subordinates.

"I order you to shoot\! Those who disobey will be executed\!"

Mocaton pulled out the knife at his waist and shouted angrily.

However, in his anxiety and anger, he accidentally revealed half of his red face from behind the wall.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Denise, who had been aiming for a long time, made a prompt decision and immediately shot the arrow that was fully drawn\!

"Pfft\!"

Blood splashed\!

The sharp arrow that flew away hit Mocaton in the eye and almost pierced through his entire brain\!

Mocaton was a veteran of hundreds of battles. The moment he was shot, he hurriedly hid behind the wall. At the same time, he suddenly raised his hand and grabbed the tail of the arrow. With a whoosh, he actually pulled out the arrow without hesitation, and pulled out his bloody eyeball along with it\!

When the two deputy generals beside him saw this, their expressions changed and they hurriedly squatted down.

At this moment, they knew that there was actually such a powerful archer hiding in the other party's army.

Mocaton did not scream. He covered his bloody eyes, gritted his teeth, and gritted his teeth in pain. He still shouted angrily, "Shoot\! Shoot\! They faked a royal decree and killed Lord Geck without permission, trying to lead the army to cause trouble\! We can't let them in\!"

The dignity of this old general was still present. After running this place for most of his life, he naturally had many loyal subordinates.

Hearing his roar, the soldiers no longer hesitated and immediately shouted, "Shoot\! Shoot\!"

Hence, on the city wall, arrows rained down.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly shouted, "Raise your shields\! Retreat\!"

The soldiers behind immediately rushed forward and raised their shields high, protecting them as they quickly retreated.

Carter gritted her teeth and said, "Sooner or later, I'll cut that old fellow into pieces and throw him out to feed the dogs\!"

She looked at Chu Xiaoye beside her and suddenly smiled. "It's a waste to feed the dogs. It's better to feed the lions."

Chu Xiaoye asked curiously, "You can still laugh?"

Carter smiled and said, "Of course, I've already done according to your method. Clearly, it's very effective. The news will soon spread in this Sunset Pass. Mocaton killed the royal princess, colluded with the Bolton Kingdom, committed treason, and submitted to the enemy. Those who are loyal to him might not continue to be loyal to him. As for those soldiers who have conflicts with him and those he has punished and insulted, they will definitely be restless. Anyway, his army will definitely be unstable. We have plenty of chances."

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked at the tall city again. "There's indeed a chance, but time waits for no one. The longer we delay, the more dangerous it will be. Mocaton might even send out news that you're leading the army to rebel and attack Sunset Pass, begging the other cities to send reinforcements. At that time, it'll be even more difficult for us to attack. Therefore, we have to resolve this matter as soon as possible."

Carter looked at him with shining eyes and said excitedly, "You have an idea?"

"Tonightâ€¦"

Chu Xiaoye had just said two words when the girl hurriedly said excitedly, "Let's continue to have a long talk tonight. You have to tell me your plan clearly. As long as your method is good, I will repay you in the future\!"

Chu Xiaoye's legs trembled and he hurriedly said, "Let's attack tonight\! Denise shot Mocaton in the eye. Now, Mocaton must be seriously injured and can't come out to command. As we attack, we'll shout. Some of the panicked soldiers will definitely not be able to resist opening the city gate secretly."

"Night."

Princess Carter looked at him affectionately and said, "It's good to have you. After we take the Sunset Pass, I'll definitely thank you properly. Don't refuse."

"Forget it\!"

Who would want your reward\!

Please be a good person and not repay kindness with ingratitude\!

Chu Xiaoye regretted falling for her trap. Now that he was riding a lion and could not get down, what should he do?
