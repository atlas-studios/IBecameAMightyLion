Chapter 235: The Little White Lion's Golden Claw

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye jumped in pain and suddenly raised his hind leg. With a bang, he kicked the little white lion's face hard and almost kicked her off the rhinoceros’ back.

Tilly was furious.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and was furious.

One's face hurt and one's butt hurt as they both glared\!

At this moment, the situation on the icy plain could be seen clearly.

The mixed fur lion king and the others were surrounded by a group of lions. They bared their teeth and roared, looking ready to fight.

The pride consisted of about ten members, all of whom had brown fur and were slightly small.

Only that lion king was about the size of a mixed fur lion king.

At this moment, he was roaring at the mixed fur lion king, as if he was comparing whose voice was louder. However, neither of them attacked easily.

Catherine stood at the back with a calm expression, keeping a low profile like a transparent lion.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that once a battle happened, she would immediately become a Ripper that made her enemies fear and despair. She would open her stomach and leave none alive\!

A truly powerful figure had always been very low-key.

Just like him.

The huge rhinoceros carried him and Tilly and walked over.

The two prides finally discovered them.

When they saw this giant rhinoceros, their expressions trembled and their bodies trembled, as if they were preparing to escape.

However, when they saw the two young lions on the rhinoceros’ back, they immediately froze in place.

The mixed fur lion king and the three lions behind him immediately widened their eyes in shock and joy. They were so excited that their eyebrows were flying and their tails were wagging.

The mixed fur lion king let out an excited roar, as if it was shouting at the lion king, "You're dead\! Our king is back\!"

As for the lion king, it did not look at him. Its gaze was always fixed on the little white lion on the rhinoceros’ back, respectful and envious.

Obviously, to the lions on the grassland, what the white lions on the snow mountain had was the dream they pursued their entire lives.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the rhinoceros’ back and deliberately squatted in front of the little white lion. He looked down at them, looking like he was the ruler of the world after the king returned.

Chu Xiaoye had seen this lion king and his pride.

The other party had naturally seen him before.

Back when they fought the enemies of the sea at the last battle on the island, they almost had a conflict.

At this moment, when the lion king saw that it was him, it no longer hesitated and immediately turned to leave with the pride.

Just this giant rhinoceros could kill them all. Furthermore, they had other helpers.

He knew that he could not afford to provoke this pride of the mixed fur lion king.

Before leaving, he looked deeply at the little white lion on the rhinoceros’ back and sighed secretly, his eyes filled with frustration.

When he was chosen by the white lioness previously, he thought that he could have a good time with her for a few days and nurture their feelings. Unexpectedly, in less than a day, he was chased back.

He felt wronged and ashamed, and he was suppressing his anger. Therefore, when he saw the mixed fur lion's pride, he really wanted to vent his anger.

However, to his surprise, the mixed fur lion king was not chosen by the white female lion. Instead, the young male lion in the opposing pride was chosen by the white female lion.

Now, this little lion had actually brought back a white female lion and a giant rhinoceros.

This dealt him a heavy blow.

The mixed fur lion king looked at his lonely figure as he left and roared proudly from behind, looking like he had won a battle.

Then, he brought the three lions, a female lion, and two warthogs and quickly walked in front of the rhinoceros. He raised his head and congratulated and submitted to Chu Xiaoye.

As for what to congratulate him for, everyone knew very well.

Chu Xiaoye must have done something to be abducted by the white lioness. Now that he was with this little white lion, something must have happened again.

Although he did not know what happened, it was very obvious that he, the young king, had already gotten the protection of the higher echelons of the snow mountain.

They would have a greater status here\!

Chu Xiaoye wanted to maintain a low profile, but his strength did not allow him to. He raised his claws and let them stand.

Then, he suddenly realized that Catherine was missing.

He looked up and saw that the little lioness was still standing in place, looking at him in a daze. No, she was not looking at him, but at the little white lion behind him.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He turned around and looked at the little white lion behind him. He sighed inwardly. That girl, Catherine, must be envious of this little white lion with beautiful fur and a rhinoceros bodyguard with a noble status.

He suddenly felt a little sad.

After all, the female cub had grown up with him and could even be said to have been raised by him.

Of course, he did not want to see her sad and feel inferior.

He swore that he would dominate the grassland and even this snow mountain in the future. Then, he would make her the most dazzling queen of all the female lions\!

Tilly also looked at Catherine.

She keenly sensed that this female cub was different from the others and that the other party's eyes were showing hostility towards her.

"Whooshâ€”"

She suddenly jumped down from the rhinoceros’ back, passed over the head of the mixed fur lion king's pride, and landed in front of the female cub. She suddenly slapped her.

Chu Xiaoye was furious. Just as he was about to roar angrily, Catherine suddenly raised her claws and collided with her claws.

"Bang\!"

The two female lions, one white and one brown, stood in place without moving and looked at each other coldly.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. Catherine's strength had increased again?

Suddenly, he realized that there was a flash of light beside Catherine's mouth. Then, a crystal whisker lit up\!

Tilly, who was standing in front of Catherine, was stunned when she saw this scene. Then, her eyes flickered and she opened her mouth, raised her claws, and revealed a friendly smile.

This was too human-like\!

The intelligence of this little white lion was beyond Chu Xiaoye's expectations.

Catherine looked at her raised right claw. The golden claw shone charmingly in the sun, just like him in her eyes.

She was stunned for a moment, and the coldness and killing intent in her eyes immediately retreated.

She lowered her head and slowly raised her claws, touching the cub's claws gently. The loneliness on her face was like snow in the wind, cold and unknown where it was going.

At some point in time, snow suddenly started to fall from the sky.

The sun was still there.

Nature also started to become absurd.

All the animals were experiencing all sorts of absurd and strange changes at this moment.

The only thing that did not change was her heart for him.

She was absolutely loyal and obedient to him.

Therefore, when she saw the cub's golden claws, she knew that he had already found his best companion.

And she would always be his shadow.

She was willing to be his shadow, willing to follow behind him forever.

Until the day he could not walk anymore.
