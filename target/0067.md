Chapter 67: Battle\!

The grass swayed.

The noisy barking of hyenas rose and fell densely.

More than thirty spotted hyenas rushed out of the bushes majestically under the lead of the new queen. They drooled as they looked at the pride and their prey with longing.

"Roar—"

Lars, who was standing at the front, bared his fangs and let out a roar, his gaze angry and fierce.

He hated these old enemies to the bones\!

The lion, the cold father, stood beside him and looked coldly at the group of enemies in front of him. He also let out a hoarse growl.

The corner of his mouth was broken and his mouth was full of blood. His thick mane made his fierce face look even more terrifying.

However, he was panting heavily with his mouth open.

The hunt and chase just now, as well as the hot weather, made him feel weak, hot, and tired.

He really wanted to lie down in the shade and rest for a while.

But.

With the crisis approaching, he had no choice but to continue to pull himself together and welcome the challenge of these old enemies\!

Callie and Maya were pregnant.

The other three female lions had exhausted their energy from hunting earlier. They were exhausted and their mouths were dry. They urgently needed to replenish their food and water.

The pride had no chance of winning.

However, how could he be willing to give up the prey that he had painstakingly caught?

He was a lion, the king of the grassland\!

How could he let a group of despicable and cunning bandits snatch his prey?

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared and charged towards the hyena queen in the hyena pack\!

To catch thieves, first catch the king\!

The lion could recognize the hyena queen at a glance. As long as he captured her, the hyenas would naturally scatter in panic\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas immediately started running.

Using the dense bushes around them, they ran around and created chaos, letting out ear-piercing cries.

Under the protection of a group of female hyenas, the hyena queen deliberately started to walk the lion. She did not run fast or slow, giving him hope of catching up but making it impossible for him to catch up.

The cold father chased for a while before panting and emitting smoke from his throat. He stopped in place and let out an angry roar.

"Hehehehehehe\!"

The hyenas let out mocking cries and deliberately circled the lion provocatively.

"Roar—"

Lars suddenly roared and rushed up\!

He pounced at the closest hyena, his movements fierce and his appearance fierce. He was unlike his usual lazy and timid self.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyena queen issued an order from afar.

The hyenas started to circle around the lion father and son pair and rushed towards the lionesses guarding the prey.

The five female lions surrounded the giraffe's corpse, bared their fangs, and let out hoarse low roars.

Callie, who was pregnant, was trembling.

They no longer had much strength.

If not for the fact that they were so hungry that they could not bear to put down their prey and the lion was here, they would definitely put down their prey and flee immediately.

They knew how cruel and cunning these enemies were\!

The enemy was huge, and they were at their weakest now. They could not resist at all.

The hyenas surrounded them fiercely.

The cold father and Lars wanted to return to save them, but they were surrounded by a few hyenas.

They chased and the other party fled, and when they ran back, the other party chased. They even took the opportunity to attack their backs.

The cold father and Lars were exceptionally furious and could only roar as they circled around them.

The hyena queen stood not far away and let out sharp and ear-piercing cries. She was commanding her army to attack one by one\!

Beside her stood five strong female hyenas.

Those were her guards.

More than twenty spotted hyenas charged ferociously at the exhausted female lions.

Little Curly Tail protected Aisha.

Mei Mei stood beside Xi'er.

Their brother was nowhere to be seen. No one knew where he went.

Aisha called out anxiously and looked around, but she could not find her other child.

Could he have been killed by these despicable enemies?

Or had he already fled?

Little Curly Tail looked at the hyena queen in the distance.

He knew what his brother was doing.

He believed that his brother would definitely be able to do it\!

His responsibility was to protect his mother\!

His mother was exhausted and could not fight anymore.

However, as long as he was here, these despicable enemies could forget about hurting their mother\!

His brother was very strong.

However, he, Little Curly Tail, was not weak either\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and took the initiative to pounce on a male hyena that had rushed close. His movements were as fast as lightning\!

The male hyena was just about to retreat when Little Curly Tail hit it to the ground and bit its throat\!

The other hyenas beside him were immediately frightened by his ferocity. After a short pause, they immediately relied on their numbers and pounced at him ferociously\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail was exceptionally brave. He did not retreat and let go of the hyena in his mouth. He roared and pounced at another\!

Seeing how brave her son was, Aisha's fighting spirit was immediately aroused. She roared and pounced forward\!

On the other side.

Mei Mei and Xi'er were also fighting ferociously.

Although Xi'er was blind in one eye, tired and hungry, she was still brave. She leaned against the giraffe's corpse and used her claws and teeth to roar and bite the hyenas that pounced on her\!

Mei Mei was much more agile.

The little lioness was extremely fast and her bite was extremely fierce. She used the giraffe's corpse as a cover and jumped left and right. She went back and forth and fled after taking a bite. She scratched and jumped away, causing the hyenas to be shocked and furious. They were furious, but they could not bite her.

The other three female lions could only lean on the giraffe's corpse and squat on the ground, facing the enemy passively. They used their sharp fangs and claws to make the hyenas not dare to pounce on them.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Under the hyena queen's furious roar, the hyenas that were still circling around could only bite the bullet and pounce on her ferociously\!

At the same time, three of the five female hyena guards beside the hyena queen rushed over.

The cold father was already exhausted. He squatted on the ground and panted heavily.

However, there were still four hyenas running around him, deliberately biting his butt from time to time.

The cold father had no choice but to bare his fangs and spin in place, roaring with a dry mouth.

He could no longer save the female lions.

Lars, who was at the side, was also riddled with wounds after biting a hyena to death. He was fighting three hyenas in the bushes.

Under the hyena queen's orders, the twenty-plus spotted hyenas surged towards the five exhausted female lions with a murderous aura like a tide\!

Little Curly Tail was covered in blood and continued to bite the surrounding hyenas ferociously\!

Three hyenas had already fallen around him.

In front of absolute numbers, Mei Mei had no place to jump and dodge. She was also injured.

The hyena queen, who was standing in the grass in the distance, immediately cried out in excitement when she saw that her victory was decided. She ran over with her two hyena guards, preparing to share the fruits of her victory.

At this moment.

The grass beside her suddenly moved.

Then, with a whoosh, a figure suddenly pounced out and bit her throat\!

The hyena queen and the two hyena guards beside her could not react in time\!

He was too fast\!

The violent collision knocked the hyena queen to the ground\!

His sharp teeth closed with a crack and bit her throat\!

The hyena queen opened her mouth, widened her eyes, and twitched. She was confused and terrified, desperate and unwilling.

She did not even see the appearance of this attacker clearly\!
