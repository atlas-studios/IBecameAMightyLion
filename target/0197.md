Chapter 197: The Battle to Protect Home\!

"Sss\!"

The pythons hiding in the turtle shell seemed to mind that the giant turtle was too slow. They hissed and climbed out from behind the turtle shell, charging into the bushes.

When they were at the sea, they liked all sorts of plants at the bottom of the sea.

Now that they had arrived at the grassland, they naturally rushed towards the bushes that were extremely beneficial to them.

Inside, they could move freely or climb trees. No one could do anything to them.

However, when they left the hard turtle shell, they realized that their terrifying fangs, thick bodies, and black mass did not result in an overwhelming situation. Instead, they died very quickly\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws and instantly cut the three pythons that crawled out of the turtle shell into two.

He retreated as he fought, putting the slow-moving giant turtles to the side first and killing only the black pythons that crawled out of the turtle shells.

Catherine, who was beside him, did the same.

With every swipe of her claws, she could cut open the bodies or heads of those pythons vertically\!

On the other side, the leopard family of four also jumped agilely and quickly waved their claws, killing the pythons that wanted to rush into the bushes, causing flesh and blood to fly everywhere\!

The two female lions covered in scars stood beside the Chino brothers. Their attacks were fierce, violent, and they even opened their mouths to bite the heads of the pythons\!

As for the cute violent bear mother and son pair, they relied on their thick skin, rough flesh and fat bodies. They hugged their heads and quickly rolled on the ground.

As they crushed the pythons, they even opened their mouths to eat quickly. They ate the heads of pythons one by one, crunching and biting until blood sprayed. They ate with relish.

In less than a moment, the grass was covered in the bloody corpses of those pythons.

When the remaining pythons saw this scene, they no longer dared to be anxious. They hurriedly crawled back into the hard turtle shell and let the giant turtles bring them forward slowly.

Although these giant turtles were very slow, they were not easy to deal with.

Be it Catherine or the leopard family of four, they could not do anything to them.

When their sharp claws grabbed them, the giant turtles retracted their heads into the turtle shell. Under their sharp claws, only white marks were left on the hard turtle shells and they became their strongest defensive weapon\!

Only Chu Xiaoye's golden claws could cut open the turtle shells and kill the giant turtle and python hiding inside.

However, there were too many of them. No matter how fast he was, he could not stop all the giant turtles from advancing.

If they were allowed to enter the bushes, those pythons would definitely rush out immediately and flee everywhere. At that time, the dense bushes and those tall trees would become their natural disguise. The creatures inside would be doomed\!

Therefore, no matter what, he could not let them climb into the bushes.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly shattered a turtle's shell with his claw. After killing the giant turtle and python inside, he rushed towards the other giant turtles.

The few giant turtles had already forced the leopard family of four to retreat.

No matter how they scratched, they could not cut open the hard turtle shell on the giant turtle's back.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not attack the tortoise shells of the few giant turtles again. Instead, he used his claws to grab the edge of the giant tortoise shells and suddenly flipped them up. The few giant tortoises turned around on the spot and lay on the ground. They swung their limbs and struggled with all their might, but they could not flip over anymore. They could only lie in place and struggle helplessly.

The leopard family of four was overjoyed when they saw this scene. They also used this method to start dealing with the huge turtle in front of them.

Unfortunately, because the turtle's shell was too heavy and there was also a thick and heavy python hiding inside, other than the strong male leopard who could flip it, the three female leopards did not have the strength to do so.

However, the male leopard was very fast. The huge turtles that ran in front of them were all turned upside down by his thick claws\!

These huge turtles that had been flipped over struggled helplessly for a few times and could only extend their heads. The pythons hiding in them had no choice but to crawl out of their tortoise shells.

At this moment, the leopard mother immediately brought her two daughters forward to kill them\!

In front of Catherine, Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that a huge turtle had been flipped over.

Chu Xiaoye had never doubted the strength of this female cub. After all, she had been a pervert since she was young.

Because the bottom of the huge turtle was not as stiff as the turtle shell on it, Catherine used her sharp claws to kill them as she flipped. Soon, her face was splashed with blood, and she looked like a bloody butcher.

Although the cute violent bear and her son were fat, they were not weak. They waved their claws repeatedly. After a while, they flipped the huge turtle in front of them and lay there patiently waiting.

Once the head of a snake or a giant turtle was revealed, they would bite it down with a crack, and as they chewed blood would spurt out. It was exceptionally cruel.

As for the Chino brothers and the two female lions, the brothers worked together and the sisters worked together to flip the giant turtles in front of them up.

The Chino brothers seemed to have found the joy of fighting. The more they played, the more excited they became. They even forgot the pain on their legs.

Chu Xiaoye saw that the situation seemed to have been effectively controlled and that the group of giant turtles could no longer move forward. He immediately relaxed and focused on killing the enemy.

However, right at this moment, the huge turtles that had been flipped over suddenly flipped back and continued to crawl\!

Chu Xiaoye looked carefully and realized that it was actually those pythons hiding in the turtle shell. They were twisting their heavy bodies and helping the giant turtle flip over.

"Roarâ€”"

At this moment, the Chino brothers, who were having fun, were bitten again\!

This time, their thighs were bitten by the giant turtle and python. They jumped in pain, but they could not break free.

The two female lions hurriedly rushed over and bit the necks of the giant turtle and python\!

The moment the Chino brothers broke free, they hurriedly limped back in fear. As they retreated, they roared and did not dare to go forward again.

The giant turtles turned around and started to shrink their heads as they advanced.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the shore was still dark. His heart turned cold and he continued to kill quickly.

There was no other way. He could only kill and retreat.

Otherwise, after being surrounded by those things, there would be sharp teeth and ferocious bites everywhere. There would be no way to dodge.

These giant turtles seemed to have started to form a formation. They were densely packed and there was almost no gap in the middle.

He had just killed a few in front of him when the ones behind him rushed up again. They attacked continuously.

Soon, the defence line was broken through and the black mass of the huge turtle army continued forward in armor.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and was only ten meters away from the bushes. If this continued, it would be troublesome when this group of giant turtles entered the bushes.

The leopard family of four was forced to retreat repeatedly.

The cute fierce bear mother and son were surrounded by the giant turtles. Their bodies were covered in wounds that were bitten, but they did not escape. They were still biting the heads of the giant turtles and pythons.

The surrounding giant turtles ignored them and crawled past them.

The Chino brothers and the two female lions were injured and limped back. Their sharp teeth and claws could not harm these hard tortoise shells, but the teeth of the giant turtles and pythons could bite them ferociously.

Therefore, they could only be forced to retreat step by step.

Only Chu Xiaoye and Catherine's defence line was still strong. However, when the huge turtle waves on both sides surged over, to avoid being surrounded in the middle, they could only choose to retreat.

Seeing that the bushes behind were getting nearer, the pythons hiding in the giant turtle were extremely excited. They started to bite the giant turtle's body in the turtle shell, urging them to move faster.

The huge turtle felt the pain and could only crawl forward with all its might.

"Boom\!"

Right at this moment, it was like a thunderclap was heard.

The ground trembled and all things lost their color\!

Not far away, a group of animals that were like small mountains swung their big ears and let out rumbling sounds as they ran over majestically\!

It was a huge herd of hundreds of super elephants\!

Under the lead of a leading elephant, the huge super elephant herd swung its long nose and ran over with a murderous aura. The ground they stepped on rumbled and they instantly crushed the black mass of giant turtles at the far side\!

The turtle and python inside the turtle shell saw Hades\!

The super elephants immediately split up and enveloped all the giant turtles on the grass under their thick and heavy elephant feet, starting to massacre them\!

In a moment, hundreds of giant turtles died on the spot.

The pythons hiding inside could not escape in time and were badly mutilated.

Even those who escaped died on the spot under those terrifying elephant feet\!

Blood splashed everywhere and flesh flew everywhere. The turtle shell that was as hard as iron seemed to be playing music at this moment. It let out continuous cracking sounds\!

The remaining giant turtles were immediately terrified. They hurriedly turned around and fled towards the river\!

The pythons hiding in them also crawled out of the turtle shell in fear and fled in panic\!

However, they were already too far away from the river, and the range of the super elephant herd was too wide. They ran very quickly, and before the pythons could crawl a few meters away, they were crushed into meat paste\!

The members of this super elephant pack were almost twice the size of ordinary elephants. They were even larger than the elephants Chu Xiaoye had seen in the herd last time and ran very quickly. Clearly, these were the largest animals on land and had started to evolve and mutate.

When Chu Xiaoye saw this group of terrifying big fellows charging over with rolling thunder, he hurriedly retreated to the edge of the bushes with Catherine and the others, afraid that these fellows would go crazy from killing and even kill them.

Elephants had always been docile. Even for carnivores, they would not take the initiative to attack and would often take the initiative to help some animals in trouble.

This time, they had mobilized in groups and killed crazily. Clearly, they had come for this group of marine creatures.

As the big brothers of the grassland, they naturally could not ignore the invasion of the sea species.

The elephant herd formed a formation and started to trample and chase, wanting to kill every giant turtle and the python inside.

In a moment, the grass that had just been black became the color of meat and blood\!

Under the constant running and trampling of this super elephant herd, there was almost no complete corpse or intact turtle shell on the entire grassland\!

The Chino brothers and the two female lions were dumbfounded.

The leopard family of four at the side were also frightened by the terrifying lethality of this super elephant herd.

"Mooâ€”"

Right at this moment, a cry suddenly sounded from the elephant herd.

Then, a tall and fat little elephant swung its nose and ran out of the elephant group. Its two slaps trembled quickly, and it looked extremely excited.

Or he looked like he was addicted to smoking\!

She rushed towards Chu Xiaoye\!

Behind her were two huge female elephants. Even if Chu Xiaoye stood in the distance and watched, he still had to look up.

The current little elephant was more than a size larger than before and was extremely fat. It looked strong and comical, but when it ran, it was much faster than before and did not seem to be struggling at all.

Seeing this little elephant run over with two huge female elephants, the leopard family of four turned around and ran.

The two female lions covered in scars were even more frightened and wanted to escape. They turned around and saw that their young king was still standing in place. They could only stop in place and tremble in fear.

At this moment, the Chino brothers beside them were extremely pleased and excited. They immediately raised their heads and stuck out their chests, standing in front of them to show that they were not afraid at all.

The might and courage of a lion seemed to finally be revealed in them at this moment\!

The two female lions looked at the two brothers, their eyes filled with shock and confusion.

When did these two fellows, who had always been timid, become so bold?

The Chino brothers looked at them with even more pride. They immediately took the initiative to run towards the little elephant with fawning expressions.

This was their big sister along the way\!

However, just as they ran in front of the little elephant, they saw it swing its nose and slap them away\!

The Chino brothers' weight now was at least 700 kilograms. Now, they were sent flying by the little elephant's nose. From this, it could be seen that this big, fat, little elephant had already evolved to a very abnormal level\!

The Chino brothers fell to the ground in a sorry state, but they did not dare to be angry, nor did they dare to lie still, afraid that they would be trampled into meat paste by the two huge female elephants behind the little elephant. They hurriedly got up and fled to the side of the female lions, looking dejected.

The little elephant swung its tail and hurriedly rushed in front of Chu Xiaoye. It looked down at him and flapped its big ears excitedly. Its thick and long nose could not wait to reach behind his butt and it was so excited that its entire body was trembling.

He seemed to be saying, "Brother\! Fart\! Hurry up and fart\! I can't take it anymore\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not stand on ceremony and slapped her nose\!

The little elephant immediately swung its nose to the right and slapped the faces of the Chino brothers, who had just returned from escaping. They staggered and fell to the ground again.

The two brothers lay on the ground with confused expressions.

The little elephant continued to extend its nose behind Chu Xiaoye's butt and fanned its ears. It let out a begging voice, as if it was saying, "Brother\! As long as you quickly start farting, you can slap me however you want\!"

The Chino brothers immediately trembled and hurriedly got up, hiding far away.
