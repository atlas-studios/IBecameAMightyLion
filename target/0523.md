Chapter 523: The Elf Girl Captured by Orcs

Two days later.

The wounds on Lanisi's body finally healed.

Other than her good physique, it was naturally thanks to Chu Xiaoye's saliva.

As for how Chu Xiaoye treated the Queen after showering that night, other than the two of them, no one knew.

Even Catherine did not see it.

She only knew that her eyes were fierce that night and she could not open them.

Before leaving, Lanisi waited outside the palace for a long time, but Princess Nalia still did not appear.

The fire dragon Dolma returned. The wounds on its body had formed scars, and it had no problem flying.

As for the other three green pterodactyls, they were still in the Elf City. Although it had always been Loli feeding them, this was their home. They were already used to this place and would not leave because of Loli's death.

On this trip, everyone was wearing the simplest clothes.

The armor was too heavy and it was difficult to move. It was also not beneficial for hiding and escaping.

Lanisi wore a red dress and stepped on Dolma's wings. She agilely climbed up and sat on its neck.

Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, Alice, Denise, and Fei'er climbed up and sat on Dolma's back.

Dolma was very big. Its surface was filled with ravines and thorns, and it was easy to sit and grab.

Princess Annie sent them off on the grass outside the castle with her elven guards.

After Lanisi left, she was the guardian of the elf city, or rather, the queen.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not see the anticipation and joy of rights in the eyes of this familiar girl. He only saw deep worry.

If they could not return in time, she could not protect the City of Elves alone.

"Sister, if things don't work out, come back as soon as possible."

Annie knew that things would not be so simple.

Even if Lanisi went personally, she might not be able to bring that person back. The two elves had long parted ways and walked their own paths, never meeting again.

A look of worry also appeared on Lanisi's face. She nodded and looked at her. "Annie, I'll leave the Elf City to you. If there's an emergency, go to the back mountain to find Nalia. Perhaps, she'll give you some good ideas."

Dolma slowly stood up and started to flap its huge wings.

The Queen's red hair fluttered like flames in the sun. She waved at the elves and looked ahead, never looking back.

Dolma flew up into the blue sky, up the white clouds, past the city, past the canyon, and then the abyss. Then, it slowly landed above the snow forest.

Chu Xiaoye regretted it.

He originally thought that he would ride this fire dragon until he reached his destination. Now, it seemed that this was not the case.

Lanisi seemed to have seen his confusion and explained softly, "Night, we are not the only ones with fire dragons. The Orc Kingdom also has them. Although they are very rare, we can't deal with them alone with Dolma. Every fire dragon has its own region and border. If Zhuo Ma continues to bring us forward, we will be easily attacked and discovered by the Orcs."

I see.

Chu Xiaoye naturally understood the territorial sovereignty of these animals.

Because he had fought more than once for the sovereignty of his territory.

Dolma spread its wings and slowly landed on the empty space of the snow forest.

The temperature difference between the two sides of the cliff was too great.

Spring bloomed in Elf City, but snow covered this side.

When they got down from Dolma, this fire dragon did not have any reluctance. It immediately flapped its wings and flew up, crossing the cliff and returning to the Elf City.

The previous battle frightened it.

"We're going on foot?"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt that this operation seemed a little unreliable.

It did not matter if he walked. After all, he had migrated many times, crossed mountains and sea, and passed through beast mountains and sea. It was not a problem at all. But what about these little elves?

Look, all of them were delicate girls. They were sure that they could travel a long distance, be exposed to the wind and sun, and cross the mountains.

Right at this moment, the neigh of a horse suddenly came from the forest in front of him.

Then, the cries of a few girls sounded. "Be careful, there are ferocious tigers\!"

Lanisi's expression changed slightly. She immediately pulled out the sword at her waist and ran over. "It's Wei Xi and the others\!"

Vilis carried the huge sword and ran the fastest. Just as she was about to draw her sword and rush over, she was stunned and said, "It's them?"

When Chu Xiaoye and the others ran over with Lanisi, they realized that five elven girls were leading horses in the forest. Under a big tree not far away, there were two strong white ferocious tigers glaring at the horses.

When Lanisi saw the two strong white tigers, she was also stunned. She held her sword and walked in front of the girls. She looked at the two white tigers with a complicated gaze and did not immediately go forward to chase and attack.

"Your Majesty, these two white tigers seem to be the two we let go previously."

An elven girl leading a horse said uncertainly.

Lanisi nodded and said, "It's them."

The two white tigers seemed to see that the situation was bad and immediately turned around to escape.

Chu Xiaoye looked at their backs and suddenly remembered that when he and Annie first came to the elves, they had seen two strong white tigers at the ice bridge. It should be these two.

However, why did they escape by themselves?

Furthermore, he had heard from Vilis that many of them had their own battle beasts or mounts. However, he did not see a single ferocious beast in the elven city these days. What was going on?

"Vilis, were the two white tigers just now the two I saw when Annie and I first came?"

At that time, the huge sword loli had welcomed them at the bridge and brought them past the two white tigers.

Vilis looked absent-minded. "It's them."

Before Chu Xiaoye could continue asking, the little lolita said, "Back then, when we discovered that the orc army was about to enter the snow forest, we thought that the entire Elf Kingdom would be doomed this time. Therefore, we let go of these two white tigers guarding the door and all the animals, including some war beasts."

It turned out that back then, the elves knew that they would die, so they let all the animals go in advance so that the animals they treated as friends and companions could live well.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye still admired the kindness of the elves.

"They definitely still know us, but it looks like they won't approach us anymore, let alone take the initiative to come over and become our friends and companions."

Vilis said sadly, then suddenly turned around and looked at him. "Are all beasts so heartless?"

Was he implying or mocking her?

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and looked at her seriously. "Lady Vilis, I don't know if wild beasts are heartless, but I know that any creature wants freedom. Beasts with freedom flowing in their genes and blood naturally desire freedom more. You caught them from the wild and raised them from young. You gave them a good life and taught them all sorts of combat skills. You stayed with them every day, thinking that you could become their friend. You even thought that they would be grateful to you, get close to you, and be loyal to you forever. However, you don't know that in their bones, they always yearn and yearn for the blue sky, white clouds, green mountains, and water they originally had, not your struggles and imprisonment, or their hypocritical love and companionship."

"Do you really like them?"

Chu Xiaoye asked her with a burning gaze.

Vilis was stunned for a moment before she nodded heavily. "Of course, I like them."

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "You don't like them. You're selfish. If you really liked them, you wouldn't have taken the initiative and imprisoned them by your side without their permission. If you really liked them, you should have given them freedom and let them choose the life they liked. You also saw just now that the two white tigers had just been released by you and knew you. However, when you came, they immediately fled. Do you know why? Because they were afraid, afraid of becoming your friend again. To put it bluntly, they were slaves."

Vilis' face turned red and she said angrily, "You're lying\!"

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "Just take it that I'm talking nonsense. However, Vilis, I've said so much and you only said three words. Clearly, you're unable to reason and have nothing to say, right?"

"Youâ€¦ you're bullshitting\!"

The huge sword loli was even more furious and flustered.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her mockingly and said, "Are you sure you want me to fart?"

Vilis' expression changed and she took a few steps back.

Lanisi hurriedly said, "Alright, Vilis, stop talking. What Night said might be right. He's a lion, so he naturally knows more about those animals than us. Since we've already let them go, let's not mention them again. We should go. At least we can pass through this snow forest when the sky turns dark."

The elven girls, who had been waiting here for a long time, brought the five horses over.

Lanisi turned to look at Chu Xiaoye and said, "Night, have you ridden a horse before?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before saying, "Does the zebras on the grassland count? I've ridden them a few times when I was hunting. There are also water buffaloes, gazelles, gnus, and elephants."

To be sure, it was a small elephant.

He suddenly thought of the fat girl who liked to eat his smelly farts. He wondered how she was doing now. When he went out to save Little Curly Tail and the others, he hoped to find her and bring her in.

"What about the lionesses?"

The huge sword loli mocked.

Chu Xiaoye said with a look of realization, "Right, there are also female lions."

After saying that, he woke up and immediately retorted, "And you\!"

Vilis' expression froze. She suddenly thought of the promise that day and the humiliating scene of her kneeling on the ground, bending down, and supporting herself with her hands.

Although he did not ride her, he hugged her from behind. If he was a lion at that time, he really rode her.

Vilis' face immediately turned red. She turned around and rode on the horse. She turned her head and looked elsewhere. She was so angry that her cheeks were bulging and her chest was bent. She ignored him.

Chu Xiaoye smiled victoriously at the queen. Then, he walked in front of a horse and jumped up elegantly.

However, before he could jump up and land, the horse seemed to have suddenly been frightened. It suddenly jumped forward and dragged the elf girl, who was holding the reins, to the ground.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye missed and fell straight to the ground.

The pain in his butt was a small matter. His crotch had also suffered a serious impact. Furthermore, when he jumped up, he was in a state of splitting his two legs. Now that he fell down, he was in a state of splitting.

Chu Xiaoye was in so much pain that his tears were about to fall.

The horse had already run away without a trace.

The elf girl got up from the ground. After chasing for a distance, she could only return with a sad face and an ashamed expression.

"Hahahaâ€¦"

Looking at Chu Xiaoye's split on the ground, his eyes wide open, and his distorted expression from the pain, the huge sword loli riding on the horse immediately swayed with laughter and almost fell off the horse.

Fei'er hurriedly ran over and hugged Chu Xiaoye's arm, wanting to help him up.

However, Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "No, no, no\! It hurts\! Close my legs first\!"

Fei'er could only let go of his arm and squat down. She started to move his thigh with all her might, causing Chu Xiaoye to let out a scream like a pig being slaughtered.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not help but punch Fei'er's exquisite face.

Fei'er fell to the ground and covered her nose with tears.

Lanisi hurriedly walked over, held his shoulder, and slowly pushed his upper body down.

When Chu Xiaoye lay back on the ground, he felt the pressure on his legs relax for a moment. Then, he started to slowly close his legs, causing the muscles on his face to twitch in pain.

The Queen also bit her lips, her eyebrows twitching as she tried to hold in her laughter.

Finally, Chu Xiaoye closed his legs and lay on the ground, looking exhausted.

Vilis was still laughing on her horse and could not stop.

With the help of Lanisi and Fei'er, Chu Xiaoye slowly stood up and exercised a few times. He immediately felt much better, but his balls still hurt.

"It's over. Lord Night's horse ran away. What should we do?"

Fei'er looked vexed.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said, "Don't you still have horses? I can ride yours."

Fei'er blinked her big eyes and said, "Then what should I do?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her legs and said, "Your legs are so long. It's a pity that you don't run."

Fei'er whimpered and pouted. "Sister Denise's legs are even longer than mine."

Of course, Chu Xiaoye was joking with her.

Even if he wanted to snatch the horse, he would not snatch this little elf's. After all, this little elf treated him very well. Before leaving, she had even brought him a few clothes, afraid that he would freeze on the way.

"Night, why don'tâ€¦"

Lanisi was about to speak when Chu Xiaoye suddenly looked at the giant sword fairy, who was still grinning from ear to ear on the horse. "Lady Vilis, can I ride a horse with you?"

"No\!"

Vilis rejected immediately.

Chu Xiaoye still walked over. Before she could react, he jumped up and sat behind her. He grabbed the belt at her waist and said, "You're the smallest here and won't occupy much space. It won't be too crowded if I sit with you. Just submit."

Vilis turned around and punched him in the face, but he nimbly dodged it.

Chu Xiaoye grabbed her small fist and the smile on his face disappeared. He said solemnly, "Lady Vilis, if you still remember that you're a member of the elves, if you still remember that I saved you, please correct your attitude."

Vilis glared angrily, but she stopped attacking.

Chu Xiaoye let go of her fist and said, "Let's go. His Majesty said that we have to walk through this snow forest before the sky turns dark."

Lanisi hurriedly said, "Vilis, let Night sit behind you. If you're really not feeling well, we can sit on a horse."

Vilis stopped talking and clamped her legs together. The horse walked forward.

Lanisi, Fei'er, and Denise got on the horses.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at the five elven girls and asked in confusion, "The bridge is broken. How did they come over?"

Lanisi rode her horse and caught up to him. She stood beside him and said, "Myna and the others did not return to the elves' city in the first place. They are the scouts of our elves and have been hiding at the frontline to investigate the news of the orcs. They were the ones who sent back the news of the orc army attacking en masse last time."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the ice and snow here and could not help but sigh. "It's not easy to stay here for long, especially for a few young girls. It seems that they must have suffered a lot."

Lanisi's eyes revealed a hint of sadness. "Yes, actually, suffering is not terrifying. They are just afraid of being discovered by the orcs. They usually hide in underground caves or rest in snow caves. If they are discovered by the orcs, they can only kill themselves. They can't escape and don't dare to be captured."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the snow forest in front of him and said, "I heard that this forest used to have an energy that could not be discovered or entered by orcs. It's the barrier of your Elf Kingdom. I almost lost my way here back then. Could it be that the energy has already disappeared?"

Lanisi sighed. "Soon, there's not much left. If we can bring High Priest Senna back this time, we will have a chance to start this snow forest again. Although the orcs built bridges and destroyed many, High Priest Senna will have a way to restore them to their original state."

"Is that high priest very powerful? More powerful than the high priest here?"

Chu Xiaoye asked curiously.

To him, a high priest who could use mysterious energy was definitely much more interesting than this noble and beautiful queen in front of him. Furthermore, the high priest would definitely not disdain to kiss him forcefully, let alone covet his handsome body.

Lanisi revealed a complicated expression. After a while, she said, "They were senior sisters and used to be close. However, in the end, they turned against each other. One left and the other stayed, never coming into contact again."

Chu Xiaoye could tell that many things had happened to the elves in the past, but he was not interested in these hatreds.

"Your Majesty, is there magic in this world?"

Chu Xiaoye was interested in these.

"Magic?"

Lanisi was stunned for a moment, then shook her head and said, "I've never heard of it."

Chu Xiaoye said, "Then how did the high priest at the back of your mountain activate that altar and summon Annie on the grassland? He could even talk to her and tell her many things?"

Lanisi smiled bitterly. "I'm not too sure about the details. It should be a magical force. If you ask Nalia, she should know."

Chu Xiaoye said helplessly, "Unfortunately, Princess Nalia doesn't seem to want to see me."

Lanisi also said helplessly, "Yes, you're not the only one she doesn't want to see. She also doesn't want to see her sister."

Chu Xiaoye immediately felt much better.

As the two were talking, Fei'er, who was walking in front, suddenly stopped. She reined her horse and looked at the forest in front of her. She whispered, "Your Majesty, there seems to be someone ahead."

Vilis immediately strangled the horse and turned around, wanting to jump down from the horse. However, she seemed to have forgotten that there was still someone sitting behind her. She flew up and kicked Chu Xiaoye's face.

Then, the two of them fell from the horse and fell to the ground.

Vilis glared at him and quickly got up from the ground. She took her sword from the horse and agilely rushed to the small hill in front of her. She hid behind a big tree and looked forward.

Chu Xiaoye followed and squatted behind her.

In the forest not far ahead, a bonfire was burning. A few figures in animal skins were sitting around it, talking in low voices.

At the same time, there were also a few figures peeing on the other side. They laughed as they measured their size and let out hehehe sounds.

On a big tree not far from these two groups of figures was a girl tied to it. From the looks of it, she should be a member of the elves.

She was completely naked and her hair was messy. There were a few bloodstains on her face and her face was haggard and blank. Clearly, she had been tortured for a long time.

Those figures were tall and strong. Some had strange horns on their foreheads and some had two fangs in their mouths. They looked extremely fierce and were clearly members of the orc tribe.

On the jumping bonfire, there was a burnt prey that let out sizzling sounds of refining oil.

Chu Xiaoye counted carefully. There were a total of fifteen orcs. Other than swords and staffs, there were also a few huge bows tied to the horses. Clearly, there were a few powerful archers.

At this moment, Lanisi walked over carefully with Fei'er and Denise and looked up.

The horse was tied to the tree and was very quiet.

Lanisi's gaze was fixed on the elf girl in the middle of the orcs.

She gripped the sword in her hand tightly, her blue eyes flickering with a cold light.

Vilis bowed and walked over.

Lanisi held her sword and walked over from another direction. At the same time, she looked back at Denise and Fei'er and told them to protect Chu Xiaoye, who did not know sword arts and had yet to transform for the time being.

Chu Xiaoye shook his head at her and rubbed Catherine's head beside him, indicating that he did not need protection. Catherine was enough.

Denise and Fei'er hesitated for a moment before they were pushed behind the Queen.

Seeing that they were moving forward, Chu Xiaoye retreated from the hill. He circled around for half a circle and walked towards the ten-over horses.

The few giant bows on the horse were very dangerous for him and the female elves.

He could not let those orcs get it.

"Who?"

When Vilis started to run with her huge sword, the orcs who were sitting around the fire and talking immediately sensed movement.

"It's an Elven warrior\!"

The orcs suddenly stood up and picked up the weapon beside them.

When they made a sound, Chu Xiaoye immediately brought Catherine and started running towards the horses.

Although he had transformed into an elf, his speed was still very fast\!

Another group of orcs who had just peed had already walked to the side of the tied elf girl and were about to touch her. Seeing this scene, they immediately turned around and ran towards the horses.

"Moke\! Quick, take the bow\!"

However, before they could run close, Chu Xiaoye suddenly swung the sword in his hand and ran in front of the horses with Catherine. He swung the sword quickly and cut off the reins on the trees\!

At the same time, Catherine suddenly roared and jumped up, pouncing on the back of a horse.

Hence, the ten-over horses immediately spread their hooves in fear and fled in panic. After a while, they ran into the distant forest and disappeared.

The few orcs were furious. They immediately pulled out their knives from their waists and roared as they rushed over.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and turned to run, his speed fast.

Catherine, who was about to rush up, immediately turned around and followed him.

Only three orcs caught up.

The other orcs swung their weapons and rushed towards Lanisi and the others. After all, the attraction of an elf girl was much stronger than that of an elf kid and a lion.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er did not miss their arrows. They shot out one by one, and the orcs fell to the ground one by one.

At this moment, one could tell how good these two girls were at archery.

The two of them were extremely accurate in archery, but in terms of speed, Fei'er was naturally much inferior to Denise.

Just as every arrow of Denise's took off the string and flew out, the next arrow was on the string. Before the first arrow could pierce the orc's body, the second had already flown out. Furthermore, every time she shot two arrows, she would move her body lightly, change her posture, run, stop, kneel, or jump up. Sometimes, she would even jump onto a tree, hook her two strong legs on a branch, and shoot from above.

Vilis, who was the first to rush out, had already merged with the sword in her hand. She wreaked havoc among the orcs like a storm, and the tall and strong Orcs could not resist at all.

In the blink of an eye, more than half of the dozen orcs had died and fallen into a pool of blood.

On Chu Xiaoye's side, the two orcs chased for a while before they saw a figure fall from the sky\!

Catherine jumped down from the tree and pierced her sharp silver claws into the chest of an orc. Then, with a whoosh, she cut open the orc's chest.

His entire stomach.

The other orc hurriedly stopped and swung the machete in his hand, but Catherine nimbly dodged it.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye had already stopped running. He held the sword with both hands and ran over. When this orc raised the weapon in his hand again, he suddenly jumped up, raised the sword in his hand, and slashed at his scalp\!

"Crack\!"

The sharp sword carried strong strength and cut open the machete the orc had raised above his head. Then, its might did not weaken. With a whoosh, it cut into the orc's head and actually cut the orc's head with its strange horns into two\!

The other orc whose stomach was cut open by Catherine was still crying out miserably on the ground. He had not lost it completely.

Chu Xiaoye raised the arrow in his hand and pierced through his throat.

When he ran back to another battlefield with Catherine, Lanisi and the others happened to have ended the battle.

The last orc seemed to be preparing to escape in fear. He was hit in the back by Denise's arrow and nailed to the trunk of a big tree. He struggled for a moment before dying completely.

"Night, are you okay?"

Lanisi held the blood-stained sword and asked in concern.

Chu Xiaoye waved the sword in his hand to show that he was fine.

Lanisi looked at the miserable elf girl tied to the tree with messy hair and walked over quickly.

"Whoosh\!"

She raised the sword in her hand and quickly cut the rope tied to the tree, then supported the elf girl.

Vilis, Fei'er, and Denise surrounded her and looked at her sadly and pitifully.

Every member of the elves knew what terrifying thing would happen when they were captured by the orcs. At that time, living might be a form of torture, and death was the best outcome.

However, most orcs would make you wish you were dead.

The elf girl in front of them was already covered in wounds and on the verge of death.

Lanisi held her shoulders and hugged her gently. Her eyes were filled with tears as she said with a trembling voice, "Don't be afraidâ€¦ The orcs that bullied you have been killed by us. We can go home."

The elf girl trembled and still lowered her head, as if she could not hear her.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the bonfire and looked carefully at the prey on it. A puzzled expression suddenly appeared on his face. This was actually a horse's head.

Suddenly, he looked at the ice pit at the side. Half of the horse's body was revealed and the saddle on its back was also revealed.

The saddle looked familiar.

His heart suddenly skipped a beat. This horse was actually the horse he had scared away previously.

"No\!"

His heart skipped a beat. Since these orcs had discovered this horse, they must have been vigilant long ago. How could they still be sitting here roasting meat and laughing loudly without being vigilant?

This was definitely not the state an orc who had been scouting the news at the front lines all year round should be in\!

"Your Majesty\! Be careful of that girl\!"

He suddenly raised his head and shouted at Lanisi.

Right at this moment, the elf girl in Lanisi's arms suddenly raised her head and revealed an ugly face with a big nose\!

"Pfft\!"

A sharp dagger suddenly pierced into Lanisi's body\!

The entire dagger almost sank into the ground\!

"Whoosh\!"

Vilis' face was pale. She suddenly slashed with her sword and cut off the girl's arm\!

"Your Majesty."

Denise and Fei'er hurriedly pounced forward and pushed the girl away.

Lanisi froze in place with a stunned expression. For a moment, she did not seem to have reacted.

Chu Xiaoye threw down his sword and ran away.

Scarlet blood flowed out of the Queen's mouth. The dagger seemed to have pierced into her heart.

The girl with her arm cut off lay on the ground and laughed ferociously.
