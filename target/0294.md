Chapter 294: A Natural Couple

Two days later.

The food hanging on the tree was finally dried perfectly under the cover of natural pure honey. Not a single one rotted.

Chu Xiaoye asked the cold father to call the elderly lions over and let them transport the food back themselves and store it in the caves in their territory to prepare for hunger.

These old lions were extremely excited.

Over the past few days, many older lions had broken away from each team and joined their team.

Now, this old pride already had more than 70 members.

Other than sighing, the former lion king would appreciate each other when they gathered. He would no longer be as cold and unruly as before and would be much more warm and tolerant.

There were also some wandering old lions that were accepted by them and became one of them.

The cold father watched as this team gradually grew stronger again and felt very happy every day.

At night, he always liked to go over and wander around, listening to the old lion kings talk about their wonderful deeds in the past and sighing about the magnificent life of lions.

During the day, he returned to the bushes and secretly went to the orchard to eat fruits and dance with the Belita sisters.

Belia taught him all sorts of charming and comical actions.

Anyway, during this period of time, be it day or night, the cold father had been very happy and fulfilled.

He seemed to have started to enjoy his beautiful life after retirement in advance.

This territory belonged to the furthest edge of the grassland. After a few battles, the black lions could not encroach on it for the time being.

Therefore, almost every day, many wandering lions would come and join them.

Other than the cold father's team, the other teams were also gradually strengthening.

Lars and One-eyed were busy accepting new members every day.

Occasionally, there would be some disputes, but they would quickly calm down.

As long as they could live well, no one was willing to cause trouble.

Compared to their previous life where they were in danger and wandering around, this life was too happy. What were they not satisfied with?

Of course, desire was endless.

This might be the case for any animal.

However, under the deterrence of Blue Eyes and the others and the deterrence of killing chickens to warn the monkeys, everything seemed to calm down.

The moon was beautiful tonight.

It was not the 15th of August, and no one knew what year it was. However, the moon in the night sky was round and bright. It was like a disc that hung there and was surrounded by many stars.

It looked very close, as if he could touch it if he raised his hand.

A snow-white figure stood at the top of the tree and really raised its claws, wanting to grab the full moon, but it only caught a breeze.

Tilly missed home.

She stood on the tree and looked up at the beautiful starry sky.

The scenery there was more beautiful than here, but there was no night sky that was so shocking.

It was snowy-white everywhere, pure and spotless. She had long been tired of looking at them.

However, she still missed home.

Chu Xiaoye quietly came to her side and extended his claws to stroke her snow-white tail. Then, he turned his head and looked at the majestic mountain range.

"Go back. You're not needed here."

His expression was very casual and annoying, as if he was despising her or chasing her away.

Tilly was very angry. She swung her tail and slapped him in the face. She bared her teeth with a fierce expression.

"None of your business\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and pushed her tail away, looking at her seriously.

"This is my territory and I'm the king here. How is it none of my business?"

Tilly suddenly turned around and raised her head, looking at him provocatively.

"I won't go back\! What do you want? Could it be that you can kill me?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her snow-white fur and ignored her fierce attitude. He looked at her sincerely.

"You don't belong here. Look at your fur. Don't you think that you're very conspicuous, extraordinary, and out of place in this team that's different from you all day long?"

The anger in Tilly's eyes gradually disappeared, but soon, a fog appeared.

She slowly lowered her head and shook her head.

"I don't think so. Meimei, Belita, and I are all having a good time."

Chu Xiaoye decided to make her recognize reality.

"However, you still don't belong here. Everyone keeps a distance from you. Even Mei Mei and Belita were only playing with you. They never treated you as a member of their team, and they never became friends with you. Be it in our pride or in the entire team, you have no place. Everyone keeps a respectful distance from you and doesn't treat you sincerely. Do you understand?"

Tilly slowly raised her head and looked at him with tears in her eyes.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled as he looked at her eyes in a daze. The emotions of this female cub were almost identical to that of a human. There was no difference at all.

However, he had to chase her away.

He had a feeling that the current calm was only an omen that a storm was about to arrive.

Those black lions were probably gathering their strength and preparing to deal a fatal blow to them.

This little white lion did not belong here, nor did it belong to the grassland on the other side of the mountain. She belonged to the snow mountain.

From her brother's strength and authority, he could tell that her identity was not simple. If anything happened to her here, he would not be able to explain himself.

If he angered those forces on the snow mountain, it did not matter if he was unlucky. He was afraid that his pride and the entire grassland would suffer.

Therefore, this little white lion could not be left alive.

"I can let Blue Eyes and the others escort you away."

Blue eyes and mixed fur had their own pride and home on the other side of the mountain. He could not keep them here for his dreams and responsibility. If they were unfortunately killed in battle, how could he explain to their wives and children when he returned in the future?

Tilly held back her tears and looked at him pitifully. She suddenly lay down with a begging expression.

"No… smelly fart king, don't chase me away. I will never provoke your authority again, okay?"

Chu Xiaoye looked determined.

"No\! You have to leave\! Leave immediately\! You're useless here. Furthermore, everyone hates you\!"

Tilly lowered her head and lay on the branch motionless.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei squatted on the branch below, not understanding why their brother wanted to chase this little white lion away.

The cold father, who had just returned from outside, looked up at this scene and cursed the fool in his heart.

Catherine, who was lying in the bushes under the tree, suddenly got up and climbed up the tree. She jumped up beside Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei and landed beside Chu Xiaoye. She looked coldly at Tilly opposite her.

Tilly seemed to feel her gaze and slowly raised her head to look at her with tears in her eyes.

"If I don't leave, will you kill me?"

She knew that this female cub was loyal to the smelly fart king and could do anything for him. She would kill whoever dared to disobey his orders.

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and looked at Catherine beside him, signaling that she was fine and to let her leave.

This time, Catherine was surprisingly not obedient.

She still stood beside him and stared at the little white lion in front of her.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was feeling puzzled, Catherine suddenly extended her claws and raised his feet, revealing the golden claws below.

Then, Catherine extended her claws and raised Tilly's feet, also revealing the golden claws below.

Then, her dark eyes looked at him and then at her.

"Look, the two of you were born to be a pair. It was not easy for you to meet, so why should you split up?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned.

Tilly's claws trembled and she hurriedly retracted them. She lowered her head tightly and tried her best to turn her eyes to look at his expression.

"Chi—"

Chu Xiaoye let out a human-like laugh and disdain. Then, he extended his claws and raised Catherine's foot high, revealing the silver claws below.

"Look, your claws are silver, and only gold and silver are a pair. Catherine, according to you, are we a match made in heaven?"

Catherine stiffened and raised her claws high. She did not move and looked at him in a daze.

"Bam\!"

Tilly swung her claws and slapped their claws down, glaring at Chu Xiaoye.

"Don't change the topic\! I'm not leaving\! I won't leave\! If you have the ability, kill me\! Twenty years later, I, Tilly, will be a beautiful lion again\!"

Catherine did not say anything else and immediately turned her head and jumped down. She passed by Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei and slipped, almost falling down. Then, she quickly climbed down the tree and crawled into the dense bushes, disappearing.

Mei Mei looked down at her retreating figure and thought.

Seeing that his brother was very angry, Little Curly Tail was also very angry. He immediately could not help but jump up and stand beside his brother. He raised his long tail and bared his fangs at the little white lion opposite him with a fierce and threatening expression.

"If my brother tells you to leave, you'll leave\! If you dare to be disobedient, be careful that I'll whip you into the sky with my tail\!"

"Bang\!"

A white figure flashed and slapped Little Curly Tail's head.

Tilly landed on his head and looked at him sideways. She instantly recovered her usual arrogance and arrogance with a disdainful and provocative expression.

She was not someone that anyone could bully\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail was furious. He immediately roared angrily and pounced forward.

"Bang\!"

Tilly slapped him again and sent him flying, not letting him approach at all.

Little Curly Tail curled his tail and hung on the branch. He bared his teeth and roared as he rushed up again.

In the end, he was sent flying again.

Soon, he completely understood that he was really no match for this little white lion.

Even if he used his tail, he could not even touch a strand of the other party's fur.

However, how embarrassing it was to be trampled by this female cub.

Furthermore, he was in front of his brother.

He roared angrily and jumped opposite the little white lion, but he did not pounce on it to ask for trouble again. Instead, he looked at her mockingly and mimicked his brother, laughing.

"Sister, no matter how powerful you are now, you will still be pregnant by my brother in the future\! At that time, let's see how you can still jump around\! I can't defeat the current you, but can I not defeat the future you with a big stomach? Just you wait\! Hehe."

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him and sent him flying.

"Idiot\!"

The cold father cursed again under the tree.
