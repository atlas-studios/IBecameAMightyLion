Chapter 62: Battle

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye's sharp claws suddenly pierced into the flesh at the tail of the wandering lion. He grabbed ferociously, and five deep bloodstains were instantly produced\!

"Roar—"

The wandering lion, who was about to bite Maya's neck, jumped up in pain. With a roar, it turned around and pounced at Chu Xiaoye\!

It looked ferocious\!

Chu Xiaoye did not continue fighting. After grabbing it, he ran away and jumped onto another Baobab tree with a whoosh\!

The wandering lion was shocked and furious. It bared its sharp fangs and roared as it chased under the tree\!

Right at this moment, another figure suddenly jumped out from behind and slashed the wandering lion's butt with a whoosh\!

He ran after slashing it\!

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail jumped onto the tree trunk and quickly climbed up\!

He stood on a branch, raised his claws, and looked at the flesh on them. He looked proudly and nervously at Mei Mei, who was beside him.

Although Mei Mei was a little afraid, she was eager to try.

Chu Xiaoye, who was sitting on another tree, hurriedly called out to stop her from being rash.

An adult lion was not to be trifled with. One bite was enough to take the cubs' lives.

A slight mistake would result in eternal damnation\!

They could be brave, but they could not overestimate their capabilities\!

"Roar—"

The wandering lion under the tree was furious after being grabbed twice by the brothers. As he roared, he circled under the tree and even tried to stand upright to climb up the tree.

However, his sharp claws could not support his heavy body\!

He slid down.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately called out to Maya from the tree, telling her to run away.

But.

Maya's two legs were already bitten and she was limping. She could not escape at all\!

Seeing that it could not climb up the tree, the wandering lion immediately turned around and roared again as he rushed towards Maya\!

He seemed to want to vent all his anger and hatred on this injured lioness\!

This time, Maya would definitely not be able to resist\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and rushed down from the tree, pouncing on the wandering lion again\!

"Roar—"

The wandering lion suddenly turned around, opened its bloody mouth, and bit at Chu Xiaoye, its gaze fierce and cunning\!

This diversionary tactic was how he had managed to survive to this day\!

Seeing that the wandering lion was about to bite Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, who was sitting on the Baobab tree, immediately trembled\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye quickly dodged. At the same time, he swung his sharp claws and suddenly grabbed the wandering lion's face\!

Then, he turned around and ran\!

He did not climb up the tree but ran towards the grassland\!

He wanted to lure this wandering lion away. It was best to let it stay away from Maya\!

He believed that with his speed, he could definitely escape from this wandering lion and even lure it to his cold father\!

"Roar—"

A deep wound immediately appeared on the wandering lion's face\!

It trembled in pain and suddenly roared angrily before chasing after Chu Xiaoye\!

However, it only chased for a few steps before it immediately stopped again. It turned around and pounced at Maya again\!

It could tell that this despicable cub was very fast\!

It would not fall for it\!

Seeing that the wandering lion did not succeed, Chu Xiaoye could only turn around and run towards the wandering lion again\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also jumped down from the tree and stood under the tree. They bared their fangs and let out roars, attracting the attention of the wandering lion\!

However, the wandering lion seemed to be determined to bite the pregnant Maya to death first\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate and could only increase his speed and pounce on the wandering lion\!

Since it could not be lured away, he would fight it\!

As long as he did not give this lion a chance to kill him, he was not afraid even if he was injured\!

The reason why he had dared to kill the hyenas and dared to risk everything to bite the hyena's neck was because he was not afraid of being injured\!

Furthermore, he was fast enough\!

After other animals were injured, as long as they got infected or recovered too slowly to hunt, it would be difficult for them to survive.

Therefore, they tried their best to avoid getting injured.

Ever since he knew the function of his saliva, he no longer had this worry.

At this moment, faced with the determination of this wandering lion to kill Maya, Chu Xiaoye could only take a risk and fight bravely\!

Although he still had the instinctive fear of an adult lion in his bones, he had to overcome his fear and become brave\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and pounced forward\!

The wandering lion rushed to Maya's side and suddenly turned around. It raised his upper body and two huge,sharp claws and ferociously pounced at her\!

If Maya was hit by these two huge claws, she would definitely fall to the ground.

At that time, she would not have a chance to get up again\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and jumped to the side. He quickly turned around and grabbed the wandering lion's butt\!

A deep wound appeared again\!

"Roar—"

The wandering lion roared angrily and turned around to bite Chu Xiaoye\!

Chu Xiaoye's movements were as fast as lightning. He turned around again and turned behind the wandering lion\!

The wandering lion hurriedly turned around\!

Chu Xiaoye did not pounce on the wandering lion. Instead, he quickly surrounded it. In one moment, he was sprinting, in another moment, he was retreating, in another moment, he was jumping, in another moment, he was lying low, in another moment, he was spinning along with the wandering lion, and in another moment, he was suddenly spinning in reverse\!

It looked like Chu Xiaoye had been attacking and biting, but he had only been dodging and spinning.

The wandering lion chased after Chu Xiaoye crazily and ran in circles. As it roared and attacked, it could not touch Chu Xiaoye at all\!

Before long, the wandering lion felt dizzy and started panting.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye took advantage of the wandering lion's slow reaction and suddenly grabbed its abdomen\!

His sharp claws ferociously pierced into the flesh of the wandering lion\!

However, before Chu Xiaoye could retract his claws, the wandering lion suddenly roared and pounced on him\!

The wandering lion's huge and fierce body followed its claws and pushed Chu Xiaoye to the ground\!

At that moment, all the wandering lion's actions were half a beat too slow\!

A powerful and terrifying aura instantly suppressed it to the point of being unable to move\!

Indeed, there was a reason for its instinctive fear.

Animals' instincts were developed and survived for thousands of years. They often revealed the most realistic things.

A young cub could not defeat an adult lion.

At least, he could not do so yet.

It seemed like the wandering lion was playing with the other party in its palms, but in fact, it would be instantly killed if it made the slightest mistake\!

The wandering lion's strong and huge body pressed against Chu Xiaoye like a mountain. Chu Xiaoye was suffocated by the pressure and could not resist.

The two sharp front claws pierced into his body, causing him to lie on the ground and be unable to move\!

The sharp fangs filled with a stench had already pierced into his neck\!

Catherine shivered in the tree.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei,who were under the tree, were also trembling under the roar and ferocious bite of this wandering lion.

Their animal instincts made them terrified.

Their brother's defeat made their previous confidence and courage vanish\!

It was already very good that they did not flee immediately.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he was doomed.

However, if he was given another chance, he would still choose to do so.

He could not help but choose his human nature over his animal instincts.

At this moment, there was really no way to change anything.

Now, it was good. In the future, he did not have to be embarrassed about being a human or an animal.

The two rows of teeth of the wandering lion were about to close.

His throat was about to be bitten off\!

"Whoosh\!"

A warm current suddenly rose from his abdomen and surged towards his limbs and head\!

He suddenly widened his eyes and woke up from his despair\!

Am I going to give up?

"Chi—"

For some reason, his sharp claws, which had suddenly become hot and full of strength, pierced through the wandering lion's thick fur and ferociously pierced into its abdomen\!

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily in his heart and fiercely pulled down with his claws, cutting open the entire abdomen of the wandering lion\!

Blood and internal organs splashed onto his body with a whoosh\!

The wandering lion's two rows of teeth that were exerting force suddenly paused. Then, the wandering lion lost its strength and widened its eyes, pressing on Chu Xiaoye while motionless.

From the perspective of Catherine and the others, Chu Xiaoye was already pressed to the ground by the wandering lion and his neck was bitten through\!
