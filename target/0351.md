Chapter 351: Untitled

Green snakes were extremely venomous\!

Chu Xiaoye had once seen in "Animal World" that a drop of venom from a small green snake could kill an adult or even an elephant.

However, those venomous snakes were usually in the tropical rain forest. Why were they here?

It seemed that the blood rain last night had indeed brought about a terrifying change.

This green snake's venom gland had clearly mutated\!

Belia foamed at the mouth on the ground, her entire body twitching as she twisted her body in pain. As for the half of the green snake in her mouth, it landed on the ground and was still twisting and struggling.

Little Mi suddenly jumped over from the side and bit the half of the green snake. Before Chu Xiaoye could stop it, it started chewing as if it was eating spicy strips.

Belita jumped down from the tree in panic and looked at her sister in fear and helplessness, not knowing what to do.

Chu Xiaoye knew that as each second passed, this female leopard would be closer to death.

He hurriedly walked in front of the bushes at the side and opened his mouth to bite off a large leaf. He quickly chewed it before walking to Belia's side. He used his claws to steady her head and spat the juice in her mouth.

Belia looked at him with her eyes wide in pain. Her mouth gradually widened as she swallowed with difficulty.

Chu Xiaoye continued to go get a few more leaves. After chewing in his mouth, he mixed them with his saliva and spat them into her mouth.

Although his saliva had the effect of detoxification, he was not completely confident in the effect of his saliva against this venom.

Suddenly, he looked at the honey badger beside him.

Little Mi had already swallowed the half of the green snake's corpse into his stomach. He looked like he wanted to eat more and did not look like he had had enough.

Chu Xiaoye immediately walked over and extended his claws to press it down. He used his golden claws to gently scratch its butt and wiped a few drops of blood with his feet. Then, he walked in front of Belia and rubbed it on her tongue, letting her swallow it.

This repeated until Little Mi's wound could not bleed anymore.

Little Mi lay on the ground with his butt stuck out and looked like he had nothing to live for.

Belia suddenly closed her eyes and fell asleep. She no longer spat white foam in her mouth and her body no longer twitched. Her breathing also became uniform.

Chu Xiaoye had once seen that when honey badgers and snake mongrels hunted poisonous snakes, they would sometimes be poisoned and fall asleep. However, when they woke up, they would digest the snake venom and be safe.

Belia's situation was probably the same.

Little Mi's blood was very immune to snake venom. With his saliva mixed in, the effect would definitely be greatly enhanced.

However, he did not dare to guarantee that he could save Belia.

Belita guarded her sister's side and looked at him pitifully. Her gaze was pitiful and helpless, as if she had suddenly lost her support.

Chu Xiaoye could not comfort her and could only let her wait patiently.

This was also a lesson to her.

Although leopards had a variety of recipes, such as those flying in the sky, running on the ground, swimming in the water, and drilling underground, there were still some things that could not be eaten casually.

Furthermore, the animals and plants had mutated. All the creatures were no longer what they originally looked like. They naturally had to be more careful.

The strong got stronger and the venomous got more venomous.

Especially such venomous snakes. They had to be careful in the future and avoid provoking them.

There was a reason why a fearless fellow like Tilly was so afraid of these small snakes. She might be instinctively avoiding danger.

After the sky turned dark, the forest was deep and quiet.

Occasionally, the roars of wild beasts could be heard, but they soon disappeared.

The aura of the pride terrified most animals in the forest. They avoided it and naturally would not send themselves to death.

Belia slept very soundly. Her heart did not stop beating and her breathing did not stop. She was quiet, just like how she usually slept.

It seemed that the method Chu Xiaoye used was very effective.

"Croak—Croak—"

Above him, the cry of a crow suddenly came.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. A silver moon was hanging on the branches. It was curved and slanted, as thin as a brow, but it was bright and clear, making the deep night sky exceptionally charming.

The little girl went to his side and handed him a red fruit, bringing it to his mouth.

She discovered this in the bushes at the side.

Chu Xiaoye looked down. This fruit looked rather familiar, like a hawthorn. However, its color was much brighter and clearer than the hawthorn.

Could it be that the hawthorn had also mutated?

Just as he was hesitating, the little girl suddenly shrank back and placed it in her mouth to take a bite. She immediately narrowed her eyes and smiled happily.

"It's edible and very sweet."

As she spoke, she extended the fruit to her mouth and stuffed it in before he could open his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye hated the feeling of being forcefully stuffed. If the person in front of him was not a weak little girl but Little Curly Tail and the cold father, he would have long slapped them.

He could slap this little girl into a bloody mess with a random claw. Her head would be separated, and she would bleed from her seven orifices. She would die\!

Therefore, he should forget it.

He chewed the fruit in his mouth and felt that it was sour and sweet. It was much more delicious than the fruits he had eaten in the orchard previously.

The little girl was very happy to see him swallow it. She took out another piece of beef from her pocket and stuffed it between his teeth. She said in a childish voice, "Eat."

Towards this childish and sweet voice and clear and innocent gaze, Chu Xiaoye realized that he could not refuse at all and swallowed it.

His heart, which had finally turned cold, melted into a mess at this moment.

Humans were indeed terrifying creatures.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and took a few steps away. He raised his head and looked at the grassland at the foot of the mountain, thinking about the future of this human girl.

He could not protect her every moment.

After going to the grassland over there, there were more dangers. Any animal could take her life.

However, if she were to leave now, she would definitely not be able to walk out of this forest.

Furthermore, something terrifying seemed to have happened to the human village at the edge of the grassland. Those red-eyed monsters might have already swept through all the human residences there.

Otherwise, this little girl's family would not have fled here in a hurry.

Therefore, it was impossible to send her back to human territory.

"King, I'm going to pee."

The little girl patted his mane and turned to walk into the forest not far away.

In the little girl's opinion, he was like the king of all animals on this grassland and grassland. He was not just a lion king in a pride.

The reverence and fawning of the lions along the way, the fear and retreat of the animals, and the intelligence and strength he displayed left a king's mark in the little girl's heart.

He was the king of this grassland, but what about over there?

When Chu Xiaoye heard this title and saw the little girl looking at him before she left, he gradually narrowed his eyes.

Over there, he was still the king\!

So what if they were big and strong? So what if they continued to mutate?

His claws and team were not to be trifled with\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt that the flames of his dreams were ignited again\!

Be a true king of the grassland and make all the animals on the grassland tremble in fear and bow down to him\!
