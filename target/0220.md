Chapter 220: Strange Reward

They left the island.

The white fox led the way north.

The sky was clear and transparent, and the ground was spotless.

The entire world was dreamlike and not like the human world under the decoration of ice and snow.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at himself and his companions beside him. He realized that they were incompatible with this snow-white world.

This was a white world.

Chu Xiaoye did not know what he was going to do next or what kind of reward he would receive.

However, the lion king with mixed fur looked very excited.

The other lion kings and animal leaders looked very excited.

Chu Xiaoye muttered in his heart, Could it be that they were rewarding territory or beautiful food?

Those were the only things that could make these animals excited.

However, he never would have thought that there was something more important than territory and food. Furthermore, every animal would chase after it with their lives.

When the white fox brought them past the ice river and into the depths of the snow mountain, five tall white wolves walked out of the forest and stood on a hill not far away, looking at them with burning eyes.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly smelled a strange scent.

This aura quickly spread in the group.

The scent of male hormones.

Chu Xiaoye had smelled it on the cold father and on the Chino brothers every time they saw the sisters.

He turned around in shock and looked at the team behind him.

This smell came from the two wolf packs.

Those two wolf packs were both grassland wolves. Their fur was silver-gray and they were strong. There were forty to fifty of them.

However, most were males.

At this moment, their eyes were shining as they looked at the five stronger white wolves on the hill not far away. They were filled with respect, admiration, and excitement.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized a problem.

In this team from the grassland, most of the members of every tribe were males.

Most of the other two prides were lions.

Even those small honey badgers were mostly male.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at the five white wolves on the hill. They were all female wolves.

At this moment, he seemed to have vaguely guessed something.

However, he found it unbelievable.

Under the lead of the white fox, they soon arrived near the five white wolves.

The five snow-white female wolves looked down at them. Their tall and strong bodies were almost comparable to that of a mutated lion.

In front of them, the forty to fifty grassland wolves seemed so small and fragile.

The five female wolves quickly looked at the two wolf packs. Their flickering eyes sized up every male wolf, as if they were kings choosing concubines.

As for the male wolves, they lowered their heads and expressed enough respect and caution. Their bodies were trembling slightly, and they were clearly excited and nervous.

"Chirp chirp\!"

At this moment, two pen birds suddenly flew up from the two wolf packs and landed in front of the five white female wolves. They chattered as if they were reporting something.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them strangely.

It turned out that the merits these pen birds recorded were to be reported to them. Then, they would use their records to choose the strongest and bravest male wolf.

Then…

He should be accompanying them in battle.

The male wolves were naturally excited to be able to fight and kill the enemy with the noble and beautiful white female wolves.

Yes, that should be the case.

After hearing the pen birds' report, the five female wolves raised their eyes and looked at the grassland wolves. Then, they walked down the hill and walked towards the two wolf packs.

All the grassland wolves lowered their heads and bowed slightly. They stayed in place and did not move, waiting excitedly and nervously for their fate to be decided.

The two white female wolves walked in front of the two wolf pack alpha wolves and sized them up carefully. Then, they lowered their heads and rubbed their heads.

The two alpha wolves were extremely excited. They quickly twisted their butts and swung their tails with all their might, but their heads were still hanging down and they did not dare to raise them.

The two white female wolves looked at them coldly and turned to leave.

The two alpha wolves were extremely excited and followed closely behind them.

Soon, they crossed the hill and disappeared into the distant forest.

Chu Xiaoye watched in a daze when he suddenly felt a chill beside him. He turned around and saw Catherine looking coldly at the remaining three white female wolves.

Eh? What happened to the lioness cub?

Could she be jealous of their fairness?

The three white female wolves walked around the wolf pack and chose a male wolf each. Then, they turned around and left.

The three chosen male wolves immediately turned their butts excitedly and followed closely behind them, leaving excitedly and proudly.

The remaining wolves immediately hung their heads dejectedly.

They left the team and walked to another path led by a white fox, like a group of pitiful abandoned bugs.

When facing the enemies of the sea, they were the victors, and when facing their companions, they became the losers.

Therefore, there would always be competition between the same species.

In fact, it was even more cruel and bloody than the competition between the beast races.

The white fox brought the remaining team and continued forward.

On the snow in front of him, a group of wild dogs with snow-white fur were waiting.

When he saw the tall and clearly much more noble wild dogs, Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt enlightened.

He seemed to understand something.

They were the victors who had defeated the enemies of the sea and obtained rewards. It was probably not just the companionship of the opposite sex.

Every male animal on the grassland would think of ways to defeat the male competitors and obtain the favor of the female. From then on, they would leave behind descendants with their genes.

Not only were there white lions, white wolves, white wild dogs, and even many white things on this snow mountain.

Perhaps, they were not natives here but had been fused and changed by different genes.

When grassland animals with many contributions had sex with the female animals here, their descendants would most likely become white species that belonged here.

Because the opposite sex here had stronger genes in their bodies.

Even if the first generation could not turn white, the second and third generation would definitely slowly turn white.

Therefore, more experts of the grassland would attack one after another and fight to arrive at the snow mountain. They would kill the enemy bravely and exchange their lives for merits.

They had the responsibility to protect the grassland and pass on their genes.

Who did not want their descendants to become stronger?

The upper echelons of the snow mountain might be using this to continuously replenish their strong combat strength here. From this, they would also replenish more young lives on their snow mountain.

This way, the life on the snow mountain would naturally become stronger.

After figuring this out, Chu Xiaoye finally understood why the mixed fur lion and the lions were so excited.

Perhaps, they had long had descendants born here.

However, those descendants were destined never to return to their pride from the moment they were born. Furthermore, their status and genes were much higher and stronger than theirs.

To a lion, they naturally did not care about this.

They only wanted to pass on their genes in this powerful place and make them grow endlessly. This was enough.

Nine wild dogs with snow-white fur walked into the team and proudly walked into the few grassland wild dog packs, carefully choosing the strongest and bravest male wild dogs.

Those male wild dogs seemed so small and careful in front of them.

Nine lucky male wild dogs were chosen and brought into the snow mountain.

The remaining wild dogs left the team dejectedly and followed the white fox.

The remaining team continued to follow the white fox.

The mixed fur lion king wagged its tail excitedly.

The other lions looked excited as well. They wanted to speed up but did not dare to surpass the white fox.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that even Blue was starting to get excited.

He turned around and looked behind him. In the team, other than the two cheetahs, there was also a leopard pack.

At this moment, be it cheetahs or leopards, all of them narrowed their eyes and beamed with joy. They looked strange and magical, as if they had become spirits.

Chu Xiaoye finally understood.

No matter how solemn and steady a fellow was usually, he could not help but fantasize when he encountered a beautiful female. He could not help but change his expression.

Blue was usually a good husband and father, but now, he was grinning and looking like an old pervert. He almost drooled, which really surprised him.

Chu Xiaoye could not understand what was so good about women.

Look at him. He did not care at all. He did not want to.

Even when he saw a beautiful lioness like Catherine, he did not feel anything. This was a true man\!

True men were indomitable and fought for their dreams\!

A true lion would never live for a lioness. Instead, it would live for its ideals, fight, glory, and dominance\!

He would not be like an idiot who lowered his head, wagged his tail, and drooled for the sake of his lionesses and turned into a pug\!

"Roar—"

On the top of the snow mountain, a furious roar resounded through the sky.

The king of the snow mountain, the powerful white lion king, was furious.

His daughter had run away from home again\!

The white fox brought the team through a forest and arrived at a valley made of ice and jade.

There were trees, grass, flowers, and bushes in the valley. They were full of life and spring.

The surroundings of the valley were still covered in snow and ice.

In the middle of the valley, there was a lake.

The lake was clear and filled with mist. The heat emitted from the water filled the entire valley, causing the temperature here to be much higher than outside.

The entire lake was warm.

When the white fox brought the team to this lake, a tall lioness with snow-white fur was taking a walk by the lake with three young cubs.

The fur on one of the cubs was not white but brown and white. It looked rather strange.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the cub and his heart trembled, confirming his guess.

At this moment, the mixed fur lion king and the other lions were looking at the snow-white lioness cub with a burning gaze.

They instinctively wanted to rush up and tear apart the three young lives.
