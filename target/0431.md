Chapter 431: Untitled

 A dog could not change its eating habits\!

A despicable person could not change how despicable he was\!

Alisa's anger almost burst out of her eyes. Although the thigh that Chu Xiaoye had bitten was free, it was still trembling violently.

Chu Xiaoye, who had jumped into the air, stopped screaming when he landed.

Eh? It did not hurt\!

It did not seem to hurt at all\!

Furthermore, his entire body was suddenly filled with strength. The virus in his body merged with his blood and merged with his flesh and bones, causing his strength to increase\!

The crisis of the virus was resolved and he became stronger.

Although the tail just now had indeed slapped him hard, he seemed to not feel any pain when he merged with the virus and his resistance was extremely strong.

The reason why he let out a miserable scream and jumped up was because of his psychological trauma and subconscious reaction\!

"Die\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily but did not land. Instead, he used a big tree and suddenly jumped forward, pouncing on the group of big gray wolves\!

The golden claw was like lightning and blood splashed\!

In the blink of an eye, a few strong big gray wolves were torn to pieces\!

Chu Xiaoye seemed to be assisted by a god as his strength increased explosively. His blood was boiling and his eyes were filled with an excited killing intent. With a few rises and falls, he grabbed seven to eight more big gray wolves and broke them into pieces\!

Alisa stood in place in a daze. She had originally planned to wait for the bastard to land before giving him a claw, but she waited for nothing. At the same time, her heart was filled with shock and shock.

She knew very well how terrifying that virus was. Although her blood could detoxify it, it would take a long time and be very painful. She might even lose her mind for a while.

This was how she survived back then.

She originally thought that this fellow would be like her previously, but from the looks of it, this fellow actually merged with the virus and was fine. It only took a few minutes\!

For the first time in her life, she suffered a huge blow.

It turned out that her talent and physique were not the best. In front of that despicable kid, they were not enough.

The combat strength of the wolf pack and the hyenas was not weak. Furthermore, they were working together now, making them even stronger. They originally thought that they could do a big job and kill this pride, but they never would have thought that the combat strength of this pride was too abnormal.

In less than a moment, only seven to eight of the thirty-over gray wolves were left. Out of the twenty-over hyenas, only five were left.

The pride attacked the hyenas the most ferociously and chased after them. In the end, even the remaining five hyenas fell into a pool of blood.

The seven to eight gray wolves took the opportunity to escape.

The lead wolf died under Little Curly Tail's tail and its head was cut in half. It died a tragic death.

Little Curly Tail was about to bring Mei Mei and Molly to continue chasing the few gray wolves that had fled when he was called back by Chu Xiaoye.

It was enough that he had won. There was no need to kill him.

Furthermore, the terrain here was complicated. Who knew that there were no other ambushes or dangers ahead.

Even the wolf pack could work with the hyenas. The rules of this world were already in chaos. All sorts of ferocious animals could work together and there were unknown dangers everywhere.

Before familiarizing himself with the environment here, he naturally had to be careful.

A sudden battle ended like this.

The blood and corpses all over the ground made the pride feel a sense of accomplishment and honor, making them even more united.

As for what had happened to Chu Xiaoye just now, not many members knew.

Chu Xiaoye's face was cold. He turned around and looked at the young lioness. He did not say anything and brought the team forward.

She can hurt him twice, but never again\!

However, this female cub had already attacked him three times. Every time, it was in the same place and the most important place for a male. He could not tolerate this humiliation.

He was even more determined to use this lioness cub as an experiment\!

At that time, he would definitely make her cry until dawn\!

Just wait and see\!

Alisa followed behind the team and looked at the figure with flickering eyes. She was even more determined to take over the pride and make him submit.

They rushed through the night.

When the sky lit up the next day, Chu Xiaoye finally brought the pride and climbed to the peak of this mountain range.

At this moment, the morning sun had just risen and clouds were lingering around it. It was hazy and green mountains and trees were vaguely visible in the clouds, like a fairyland.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the mountain and wanted to look at the environment at the foot of the mountain, but he fell into the clouds and could not see anything clearly. Even the hundreds of meters around him could not be seen clearly.

The sea of clouds and fog rose and fell, stretching for thousands of kilometers. It almost drowned all the surrounding mountains and scenery.

However, there was still a mountain in the distance that revealed the clear peak that was upright and could pluck the sun and moon. It was like a king that stood majestically in the middle of many mountains. The sky above him looked down at the ground.

The sharp peak was covered in snow and crystalline. It flickered with a charming luster under the sun.

It was the snow mountain Chu Xiaoye had seen before.

Chu Xiaoye had once reached the snow mountain, but he had only passed the low forest or small mountains around the snow mountain. He had never approached the true snow mountain in front of him.

Now, it seemed even more shocking.

His eyes flickered with a golden light as he silently calculated the distance between here and the snow mountain. It was not too far, but it would not be too close.

Due to the cover of the clouds, he could not know how many mountains were in between.

Of course, his goal was not there.

The exhausted pride lay in the rock pile on the hill to rest, as if they were devoured by the clouds around them. Even if they were very close, they could not see clearly.

The sun rose, but the misty clouds did not reduce or dissipate. They were still like the sea, with wind and waves rising endlessly.

Furthermore, more clouds were blown over.

Even if Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with a golden light that could penetrate the darkness, he could do nothing in front of these clouds. Other than being able to smell the aura of his companions beside him, he could not see their faces and figures.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye growled and told everyone to be vigilant and rest in shifts.

At this moment, if an enemy suddenly attacked, they could only rely on their scent to attack and defend. They could not see the enemy or their companions at all, and it was very dangerous.

Chu Xiaoye personally patrolled the surroundings, occasionally stepping on his companions' legs and bodies. He even stepped into the mouth of the cold father who was yawning.

Therefore, he could only growl as he walked, telling everyone to pay attention to avoid him.

Catherine followed closely behind him. Even if she could not see clearly, she could smell him clearly.

For the first time, the female cub felt terrified and uncomfortable.

She hated these clouds that covered his figure.

Although there were many wild beasts in the surrounding forest, the aura of the pride made the wild beasts instinctively afraid and retreat.

When the king of the grassland came to the forest, no one dared to underestimate him.

Everyone was very tired. Just as they lay on the ground, they closed their eyes and did not even care about the hunger in their stomachs.

Climbing the mountain was torture to them. Furthermore, it was such a steep and majestic mountain.

At this moment, even if everyone wanted to be vigilant, they had no strength.

Even the energetic Little Curly Tail was exhausted as he lay on the ground. His entire body was aching and he quickly entered his dream.

The sun's dazzling light did not bring any warmth to the mountaintop or chase away the annoying clouds. It only made the distant scenery brighter.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and turned his head.

Catherine, who was thinking about something, did not have the time to stop. She hit his butt and woke up, hurriedly taking two steps back.

She could not see his eyes and expression, so she naturally did not know if he was angry. She was a little uneasy.

Chu Xiaoye growled and told her to stop and rest. He would change shifts to patrol later.

Catherine hesitated for a moment and lay down obediently, but she looked at the tail in front of her with flickering eyes.

She could only see the tail and half a butt.

When Chu Xiaoye lay down too, she heaved a sigh of relief.

She would never be too far away from him.

Chu Xiaoye growled again and told everyone to rest. He would pay attention to the wind and grass around him at all times.

Although he could not see, lions' noses were very sensitive.

After familiarizing himself with the scent of the pride, it was easy to sense an unfamiliar scent approaching.

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes, but his vigilance did not relax.

Before long, a familiar smell suddenly approached and pounced on him, pressing him down.

Before Chu Xiaoye could resist, she bit Chu Xiaoye's neck and the eyes that were close to his face were filled with threat.

"How dare you resist\! I'll bite you to death\!"

The female leopard trembled in excitement.

However, Chu Xiaoye only twisted his neck and her two rows of sharp teeth started to slip on the golden fur.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye was merciless and slapped her away.

It was still the familiar violence, the familiar pain, and the familiar flight.

Belia failed again.

She fell heavily behind Catherine and lay motionless on the ground for a while. She struggled for a moment and crawled to Catherine's side. She placed her head beside Catherine and walked side by side, looking forward in a daze.

Catherine was looking at the tail.

Catherine moved away from her.

Belia moved along and did not care about her disdain. She leaned close to her and gave her a sneaky look.

"It's very sexy, right?"

Catherine turned around and looked elsewhere. Her gaze was cold and she ignored her, but she thought to herself, Of course.

Belia started to quietly move forward, staring straight ahead as saliva flowed from the corner of her mouth.

Catherine glanced at it disdainfully and suddenly thought of one word: simp\!

"Bam\!"

Before Belia could approach, Chu Xiaoye swung his tail and hit the female leopard in the face.

Belia quickly retreated and stood beside Catherine with her head and shoulders. A clear wound appeared on her face.

Chu Xiaoye did not seem to have mercy.

He could tolerate harassment once or twice, but facing continuous harassment, he would really be angry.

This female leopard looked smart, but she did not know her limits. She was terrifyingly stupid and stubborn. Could she not have realized that all her actions were wishful thinking?

A dignified lion king was surrounded by beauties. Looking across the mountains, there were beautiful female lions drooling over his body. Why would he fancy a stupid leopard? He could not let his clean, heroic, and handsome body be tainted by a leopard\!

Unless he was blind\!

"Whoosh —"

The cold wind blew and the clouds rolled.

Everything in front of him instantly turned white. He could not even see half a meter away.

He was really blind.

"Whoosh\!"

An unfamiliar aura suddenly rushed over from the forest at the side as fast as lightning\!

Before Chu Xiaoye could roar angrily, Mei Mei's terrified roar suddenly came from the side. Then, the roar quickly rushed down the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and chased after the roar that was getting further and further away.

But soon, Mei Mei's roar disappeared.

There was white in front of him. Chu Xiaoye stopped in place and could not find his direction.

"Roar—"

He immediately stabilized his mind and roared, letting the pride gather and chase down the mountain.

He was too careless.

No matter how tired everyone was, he should not have let them rest here.

With such a big fog, they could not see the enemy clearly. Although they could smell each other, it was too late to react.

The enemy seemed to know the bad situation here very well. They might even be able to see things clearly in the fog.

They were completely passive.

Mei Mei had been abducted by the enemy. If he abandoned the pride and chased after her in a hurry, more enemies might rush out of the white clouds and bring disaster to the pride\!

Therefore, he could only bring the pride and rush down the mountain, leaving this dangerous place as soon as possible.

Although he was anxious, this was the only way.

He could not ignore the safety of the entire pride for Mei Mei.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye deeply felt powerless and afraid.

If anything happened to Mei Mei, he would probably never forgive himself.

The mountain path was rugged. As they ran down, almost every member fell, but they did not stop to lick their wounds. Instead, they continued to run down with all their might.

The dense fog started to decrease.

The light of the sun in the distance increased.

Mei Mei's scent was clearly lingering on the path down the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and fled the clouds, chasing after the enemy who had abducted Mei Mei. He ran as if he was flying in the unfamiliar forest.

The clouds decreased and the scenery at the foot of the mountain became clearer.

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye saw a grassland under the thin clouds. It was vaguely visible, vast, and lush, like a paradise under a fairyland\!
