Chapter 34: Mother and Daughter

"Roar\!"

Mei Mei, who was not far away, let out an angry roar\!

She bit the neck of a male hyena\!

The two male hyenas took this opportunity to bite her thigh\!

In the bushes.

Little Curly Tail was covered in blood and fighting the two female hyenas\!

Beside him, there were already three hyenas with their mouths open. They were lying on the ground with their necks broken.

Gigi's scream was even more miserable and desperate.

Her spine had been broken and her entire body was dripping with blood. She lay on the ground and could not stand up anymore\!

A group of hyenas surrounded her excitedly and started biting her body viciously\!

She could only bare her fangs and tilt her head, roaring helplessly and in despair. She could only watch helplessly as her body was cruelly eaten by this group of enemies\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye's eyes were red as he swung his claws crazily, wanting to rush towards her\!

However, there were too many hyenas around him\!

When he slashed the female hyena's stomach with his claw, not only did the other hyenas not retreat in fear, they attacked him even more crazily\!

His back, limbs, butt, and even his abdomen were bitten and dripping with blood.

He was in unbearable pain and his entire body was trembling. He had long lost the strength to save them. He could only use his last bit of strength to continue brandishing his claws, blocking the ferocious bites of these enemies with great difficulty\!

He did not want to die.

He wanted to live.

However, his claws became heavier and his body became weaker and weaker. His wounds and bleeding, as well as the enemy's continuous crazy attacks, were wearing away his last bit of strength.

His vision started to blur.

The scene in front of him started to sway.

The might of his slash made the hyenas afraid and go crazy\!

They knew that if they did not kill him now, when he grew up in the future, the entire hyena pack, or even their descendants, would suffer\!

Therefore, they started to risk their lives\!

The hyena queen's bite was especially fierce and cruel\!

Every move was fatal\!

Chu Xiaoye felt his tensed body totter and was about to fall.

In front of him were ferocious enemies baring their fangs\!

They attacked endlessly wave after wave\!

It was as if the entire world was left with these bloody mouths full of fangs, ferocious and terrifying, filling his vision\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly sounded from the pride behind him\!

The lion, the cold father, rushed back. His mane fluttered as he ran like he was flying. He suddenly jumped over and bit the neck of a female hyena\!

The female lion, Callie, also pounced ferociously at the hyena queen\!

Lars returned and roared as he charged at a male hyena who was eating meat\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The Hyena Queen immediately turned around and ran, roaring anxiously.

The other hyenas immediately rushed forward and fled\!

The lion glanced at the few young cubs who were dripping with blood and put down the hyenas in its mouth. It roared angrily and chased after them\!

When he was mating with Callie, he had run too far away. It was only when he heard Lars' terrified roar that he and Callie hurriedly ran back.

The four female lions went out to hunt and left the cubs to him and Callie to take care of. He originally thought that with his deterrence, there would be no more enemies coming. Who knew that this group of despicable enemies would be so daring and cruel\!

He was both angry and embarrassed. Therefore, he roared and chased after them, wanting to bite a few more to death to vent his anger\!

Callie also followed angrily and shamefully\!

She did not know how to explain to her sisters later.

Lars stopped in place and stared blankly at Gigi, his body trembling.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground and looked over with red eyes.

Gigi was dead.

Her mouth was open and her eyes were wide with fear. Only her head and neck were left.

Chu Xiaoye's body started to tremble.

In the grass not far away, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were also trembling as they looked at Gigi, who died tragically.

The air was filled with the strong smell of blood.

There was dead silence in the bushes.

Until a few panicked roars came from the camp of the lions.

The four female lions that had gone out to hunt finally returned.

They smelled the terrifying scent of blood, and their archenemies, the hyenas.

They put down their prey and ran over.

Then, they were stunned by the scene before them.

Other than Lars, who could still stand, the other cubs were all lying on the ground covered in blood and wounds.

And Gigi was already dead.

"Roar…"

Her mother, Maya, stood in place for a long time before she let out a sorrowful roar. Her eyes were blank as she slowly walked over step by step.

She stopped in front of her daughter and faced her head and her pair of frightened eyes. She let out a sorrowful whimper.

The wind blew and leaves fell.

The other lionesses looked at her silently. Then, they walked to their respective children and stuck out their tongues to lick their wounds.

They did not know if their children would survive.

Aisha walked to Chu Xiaoye's side first and let out sad cries as she helped him lick the wound on his abdomen.

The wound there was the most fatal.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground, feeling numb from the pain.

His eyes were still scarlet as he stared blankly at the dead Gigi and her mother.

The pitiful lioness stood in front of her daughter and looked at her for a long time.

Then, she lay down and stuck out her tongue, licking her daughter's head gently and lovingly.

It was as if her daughter was still sleeping.

"Roar\!"

She called out hoarsely, not knowing what emotions she wanted to express.

However, Chu Xiaoye, who was looking at her in a daze, suddenly stood up, his eyes filled with shock and fear.
