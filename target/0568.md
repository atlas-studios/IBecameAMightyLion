Chapter 568: Island Python

In the room.

Little Guai was frightened and was still crying.

Chu Xiaoye, Lanisi, and the others were comforting her.

As for Qin Mo, she was guarding outside.

This girl knew that the young and vigorous descendants of the Qin family on the ship would definitely not let go of the youth and his friends in the house easily. Therefore, she blocked the door and would never let anyone in.

Qin Ci came angrily, but she stopped him.

After the other members of the Qin family calmed down, they also heard the reason.

Hence, everyone found the Qin Zhitan and wanted an explanation. If the explanation of Qin Zhitan did not satisfy them, they would find the elves.

Qin Zhitan knew the damage this matter had done to these people.

If he did not pacify them, blood would flow like a river on this big ship again.

Qin Zhitan gathered everyone from the Qin family on the deck, then told them about Chu Xiaoye and the others saving their lives and how they went to the Qinhuai River that night.

"The cause of this matter was my Qin Manor. If I did not try my best to invite Nephew Chu and the others to go out and play, if not for Little Guai messing around and asking Nephew Chu to match couplets, if not for Mo'er wanting to find her big brother, these things would not have happened. Therefore, if everyone wants to blame someone, blame us. I, Qin Zhitan, have caused your family to be destroyed and sent to the sea. I, Qin Zhitan, will bear all the responsibility. If you want to kill or torture me, come at me. Nephew Chu and the others only killed because they wanted to save us. My Qin family is only grateful to them, but we don't blame them. I hope everyone understandsâ€¦"

Qin Zhitan stood on the deck with a look of facing death with grave sins and taking all the responsibility.

When he finished, the deck fell silent.

The descendants of the Qin family knew his personality. If the other party had not forced him too much, why would he be like this?

At this point, so what if they pursued whose responsibility it was?

They could not kill each other on this ship just after escaping\!

Therefore, under the persuasion of a few old men, the emotions of the Qin family members gradually calmed down.

Qin Zhitan still had industries in the overseas Rakshasa Kingdom. They still needed his help when they left their homes this time. Otherwise, they could not survive in other countries.

Qin Zhitan also knew this, so in the end, he generously expressed that as long as he had a bite to eat, he would never starve anyone on the ship\!

Hence, everyone calmed down.

A commotion that was about to happen finally disappeared.

Actually, Chu Xiaoye was already prepared.

As soon as he got on the boat, he let Lanisi and the others stay in the room with him. Then, he pulled out his sword and guarded the door, just in case.

Seeing that the matter was resolved, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.

The Qin family had all been crew members before. In order to prevent Old Man Wu's crew from slacking off and making the ship travel too slow, the descendants of the Qin family went to supervise under Qin Zhitan.

Although they had already left the shore, the danger was not resolved.

No one knew if Suhang City would send military boats to chase after them.

They had to travel non-stop.

A few waves of the crew took turns to work, and the big ship continued to move forward quickly.

Three days later, just as the children of the Qin family were on duty, Qin Ci, who was standing on the deck and looking out, suddenly shouted, "The Suhang Navy is here\! The Suhang Navy is here\!"

Many people heard the shout and ran out of the cabin in panic, looking behind.

Chu Xiaoye also ran out with Catherine.

On the sea behind, three big boats suddenly appeared and were chasing forward at an extremely fast speed\!

When the Qin family saw this, their faces turned pale.

They worked at the harbor all year round and naturally knew how terrifying these military boats were. Not only were those military boats larger than their merchant ship, they were also filled with artillery and sharp weapons. They were no match for them\!

Furthermore, the other party were all warriors who had been through hundreds of battles. The three military boats were also very fast. They could not escape at all\!

Qin Zhitan stood on the deck with a pale face and despair in his heart.

Old Wu stood beside him and said trembling, "It's over\! It's over\! It's really over."

When the three military ships caught up and fired, they would not give them any chance to explain. Without exception, no one on this big ship would survive\!

Seeing that the three military boats were becoming clearer, the Qin family who was controlling the big ship were about to give up in despair.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly pointed to the right and said, "There's an island there\! Let's steer the boat there and go ashore together\! The other party is a navy and has a big ship and artillery at sea. We're definitely not their match. However, as long as the other party goes ashore to hunt, we have a chance of survival\!"

With that said, everyone looked to the right.

However, the sea was hazy with smoke and they could not see any island.

Chu Xiaoye immediately said to Qin Zhitan, "Uncle Qin, please believe me\! There's indeed an island there. This is my only and last chance\! As long as we go over, we can definitely survive\!"

The despair in Qin Zhitan's heart suddenly turned into hope.

He made a prompt decision and immediately instructed the Qin family's crew loudly, "To the right\! Dock on the island\! As long as we dock on the island, we will definitely survive\!"

Hope immediately rose in the desperate crew and they immediately started working.

The big ship quickly changed directions and walked in the direction Chu Xiaoye mentioned.

Indeed, after moving forward for more than 200 meters, the people on the deck vaguely saw the island in front of them through the smoke.

"There's really an island\! Quick\! Speed up\! We're saved\!"

Everyone was overjoyed.

At this moment, the three Suhang military boats were at full mast and chasing after them at lightning speed.

Soon, the big ship broke through the fog and brought these terrified and helpless people towards the island.

Before the big ship reached the shore, many people jumped down from the ship and ran towards the shore.

They were terrified of the artillery on the three military boats and wanted to escape to the island to hide.

Qin Zhitan immediately shouted, "Everyone, don't run around after coming to the island. Listen to my orders\! If we split up, we might be defeated by those navy men one by one and killed\! We have to gather, pick up our weapons, and fight them seriously\!"

The Qin family immediately roared in unison and picked up their weapons.

The big ship soon reached the shore.

Chu Xiaoye hugged Little Guai, brought Lanisi and the others, and jumped down the ship with the others, charging ashore.

At this moment, the three military boats had already caught up.

"Open fire\! Open fire\!"

He heard the roar in the wind.

Hence, the artillery on the three military boats started shooting.

"Boom\! Boom\! Boom\!"

The artillery fell on the coastline, causing water and mud to explode.

The Qin family and Old Wu's crew ran in fear and quickly ran into the forest on the island.

The three big ships immediately stopped shooting and quickly approached the shore. Without any hesitation, they gathered together, went down the ship to chase and went up the island.

This island was very big and their artillery could not cover it at all. They thought that they were soldiers who had been through hundreds of battles and that the other party was only an ordinary merchant marine. No matter where, the other party was definitely not a match for them.

They had to catch at least a few alive and bring them back to Suhang to take the blame\!

"Kill anyone who resists\!"

Although the navy on the three big boats had come in a hurry and their members had not arrived, there were at least a thousand people. They almost attacked in full force and rushed up the island.

At this moment, Qin Zhitan was shouting for everyone to gather and not run around.

"Ah â€”"

A young man from the Qin family, who had left the team and was about to escape into the distance to hide, suddenly let out a scream. He was bitten by a super python that was more than ten meters long and swallowed whole\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at it from afar and his heart trembled.

At this moment, he realized that the forest on this island was lush, tall, and dense, like a primitive forest. There must be many dangers hidden inside\!

"Catherine\! Follow beside me and don't scout the way in front\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted at Catherine, who was running in front of him, and suddenly slowed down. He looked ahead vigilantly and listened to the surroundings. He sniffed the aura of the forest, as if he had returned to the time when he was hunting on the grassland.
