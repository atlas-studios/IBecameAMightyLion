Chapter 404: Untitled

"Chi—"

When Chu Xiaoye's sharp claws dug the bullet out of Mixed Fur'S wound, blood suddenly sprayed.

Mixed Fur's body trembled in pain, but he gritted his teeth and did not move.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly used his claws to press on the area near the wound to stop the blood. After a long time, he slowly let go.

Blood slowly flowed out of the wound and did not spray out like before.

Mixed Fur's physique after evolution was rather strong. After his saliva treatment back then, his recovery ability was greatly enhanced.

Chu Xiaoye got up and walked to the bushes at the side. He bit off a few green leaves and chewed them into powder in his mouth. He mixed his saliva and smeared it on the mixed fur's wound, blocking the bloody hole.

A cool sensation immediately extinguished the burning pain on his wound.

Mixed Fur twisted its head and looked at him gratefully.

He did not know if he could survive, but this young king did not abandon him like the countless cold tribes he had seen in the past. Not only did he take the risk and leave with him, he was also personally saving him.

To be able to follow such a king, he would have no regrets even if he died now.

When Chu Xiaoye finished everything last night and turned to look at Belita, the little girl had already taken the bullet out of Belita's wound.

Belita had already woken up and was enduring the pain as she looked blankly at the little girl in front of her.

The little girl's two small hands were covered in blood. She was in a daze as she looked at the blurry wound and did not know what to do next.

She knew that she had to apply medicine and bandage it, but she did not have any tools.

Chu Xiaoye walked over and used his claws to gently touch the wound to confirm the female leopard's mental state.

Belita trembled in pain and immediately bared her fangs at him, letting out a pitiful whimper.

The female leopard's physique was not bad and might be related to the saliva he had given her previously.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the bushes at the side and chewed a mouthful of leaves. Then, he walked over and smeared it on the female leopard's wound to stop the bleeding.

Belita turned to look at him. Her eyes were actually filled with tears. She did not know if it was because of pain or because she was touched.

Chu Xiaoye thought of all the things that had happened to him when he was young. He could not help but extend his claws and stroke her head, comforting her not to be afraid. She would definitely be fine.

A soft body suddenly leaned over and rubbed against his body, snuggling up to him. She even stuck out her tongue to lick the mane on his neck.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw a pair of infatuated eyes and a leopard face filled with enjoyment.

Belia's entire body leaned on him. Her beautiful and slender figure, straight and strong long legs, and gentle expression were like that of a young girl in heat, trying her best to charm the boy she loved.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not give her father face. He slapped her to the ground and left.

This lion grinding little demon. Her sister was already in such a state, but she still wanted to flirt and play with him. Did she have any conscience or morals?

Furthermore, you're a leopard. Why do you always seduce lions?

Although This King was not a complete lion and his thoughts were extremely open and bold. He did not care about these secular etiquettes and did not care about the opinions of the other lions and leopards, but certain readers, who This King depended on for his livelihood, might\!

Therefore, don't even think about it\!

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree, his eyes flickering with golden light. He checked the surroundings vigilantly, afraid that the red-eyed monsters and the Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes would chase after him.

Belia got up from the grass and looked like an abandoned resentful woman. With a whoosh, she turned around and crawled into the bushes at the side, going to be sad alone.

Blue and the female leopard walked to Belita's side and looked at her lovingly. They licked her fur and comforted her gently.

The little girl wiped the blood on her hand on the grass and wiped it with the leaves again. Then, she came to Belita's side and observed the wounds on her body.

Belita looked at her gently and curiously, no longer having the coldness and alienation from before.

The little girl probed and carefully rubbed her head with her small hand. Seeing that the little leopard was not angry, she immediately smiled happily.

The big black bear seemed to be a little jealous. It went to her side and lowered its head, letting her touch it too.

The little girl smiled and rubbed its head again.

The big black bear lay down and narrowed its eyes comfortably, like a docile cat.

The nervous and dejected atmosphere gradually dispersed under this warm scene.

Everyone calmed down and closed their eyes to rest in the quiet night.

After dawn.

When Mixed Fur woke up, he realized that he was still alive and the pain on his wound seemed to have disappeared by more than half in surprise.

He stood up and moved around a few times. He realized that he had recovered his usual energy and strength. He was still a mighty and strong lion\!

The pain and despair from yesterday disappeared in a short night.

He raised his head and looked at the figure on the tree under the mottled sun, his eyes filled with golden light.

When Belita woke up, it was already noon.

Her father and mother were waiting anxiously beside her, looking at her worriedly.

The little girl also squatted beside her and examined the wounds on her body carefully.

Belita could not feel the pain from yesterday and felt that she had recovered her strength.

She carefully tried to stand up, walked a few times, and jumped a few more steps. She actually did not feel any pain at all. The wound on her butt seemed to have healed overnight.

She was extremely happy.

Blue and the female leopard went to her side excitedly and rubbed her fur, celebrating her rebirth.

The little girl widened her eyes and looked at her in surprise, finding it unbelievable.

Although the wound on the little leopard's butt was not too deep and did not reach the bones, she had personally used the knife last night and knew how terrifying that wound was. After the bullet was taken out, the wound was even larger.

If she was a human, she would need at least half a month to recover.

However, this little leopard had only slept for a night and her wounds had yet to be treated and bandaged. She found it unbelievable that she could recover so quickly.

The little girl turned around and looked at the tall and mighty Mixed Fur. The lion was also full of life and looked almost healed.

The wound from the bullet actually healed overnight. This overturned her understanding.

The little girl thought of the king who had smeared leaves on his wounds last night.

"It seems that the king is quite capable."

The little girl thought to herself. She looked up and happened to see Chu Xiaoye standing upright on a branch, his two claws gripping the tree trunk, standing like a human to pee\!

Alright, she admitted that she had peeped at little boys peeing in the past.

The urine flowed down the tree trunk and the air was filled with the scent of male hormones.

Belia, who was sleeping in the bushes, immediately rushed out and rushed under the tree excitedly. She looked up, but she did not see anything.

Chu Xiaoye had already jumped down from the tree and raised his claws, scaring her so much that she shivered and hurriedly ran back.

Since Mixed Fur and Belita's wounds were almost healed, they should continue forward.

For the pride, there was no point in staying in this forest.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued to climb.

The mountain range was not low this time. As the wounds of Mixed Fur and Belita had yet to heal completely, they climbed very slowly. Two days later, they climbed to the top of the mountain.

Standing on the mountain peak, Chu Xiaoye looked up and was surprised to see the snow-white peaks behind the heavy mountain in the distance.

It seemed to be the snow mountain he had been to before\!

Although it was cold and snowed all year round, making it extremely difficult for grassland animals to survive, at least there was food and it was safer than here.

If he could not find a better place to stay next, Chu Xiaoye could only bring the team across the mountains and go to the snow mountain.

At the foot of the mountain here, there was still a lush primitive forest.

However, compared to the forest previously, there seemed to be more animals here.

The cries of many birds came from the forest. Some wild rabbits and squirrels appeared one after another and flashed past.

Chu Xiaoye knew that everyone was very hungry. They had to eat some food and replenish their energy today. Otherwise, they might not be able to last until the foot of the mountain.

Although it was almost evening, Chu Xiaoye still did not let everyone stop to rest. He walked down the hill and entered this new ancient forest.

After walking for a distance, Little Curly Tail, who was running in front using his tail to open the way, suddenly roared and jumped up. Then, he jumped in place and cried out endlessly.

The members of the pride were shocked, but they looked confused, not knowing what was happening.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others looked around warily, but they did not discover anything unusual.

Little Curly Tail was still jumping and crying out miserably, wagging his tail vigorously.

Chu Xiaoye walked close and slapped him to the ground. He looked carefully at his tail and realized that the end of his tail had turned black\!

At the same time, the black color was quickly spreading up along the tail\!

Little Curly Tail cried out in pain and swung his tail around with all his might, as if he wanted to shake off the painful portion of his tail.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and swung his golden claw, cutting his tail into two\!

Blood splashed and the back half of the tail fell to the ground\!

"Roar—"

An intense pain suddenly assaulted him\!

Even when Chu Xiaoye held him down, Little Curly Tail jumped up in pain and started to roar.

The other members of the pride stood at the side in a daze, stunned and terrified, not knowing what was happening.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at the broken tail on the ground. As blood flowed out, the black ink that was initially very short was spreading up at an even faster speed\!

In the blink of an eye, the half of the broken tail on the ground actually turned black\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He raised his head, his eyes flickering with golden light as he carefully checked the surrounding bushes.
