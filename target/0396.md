Chapter 396: Untitled

The disaster was temporary.

However, the damage brought by the disaster was long-lasting.

Even if the grassland had already calmed down, it was filled with desolation and could not survive.

The sea might retreat or occupy that place forever.

It had already become another cradle of life.

The sea on Earth always quietly devoured land. Even if they filled the sea and built land, it might not change anything in the end.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and watched the sea push mountains and destroy forests, expand the borders, and form a new lake and many new streams. He ran wantonly in the ancient primitive forest and could not help but praise the might of nature and the insignificance of himself and other lives.

No matter how strong a life was, it was insignificant in front of nature.

After resting for two hours, they continued forward.

Although the little girl had recovered some strength, it was difficult to walk in this forest with thorns, vegetation, and no path.

Chu Xiaoye let the energetic Little Curly Tail walk in front. As he walked, he used his tail to open the way.

His strong and long tail that was like an iron whip slapped the surrounding vegetation with a crackling sound, easily opening a path.

Little Curly Tail liked this job very much.

He liked to show himself in front of everyone and liked his brother instructing him to do things.

Because in this way, it meant that he was very valuable to his brother.

Unlike the little thing following behind, other than acting cute and making some strange sounds, it was useless. It also loved to fall and did not even know how to walk.

"I despise her\!"

Little Curly Tail muttered to himself as he led the way.

He really did not know why his brother brought her along.

Perhaps her brother had seen her thin skin and tender flesh and was preparing to eat her when she grew up.

Anyway, her brother was always right. With his intelligence, he would definitely have a use for her.

Whatever his brother wanted to do, he would support him unconditionally. He could not be like the stupid father who always liked to think of himself as smart and argue with his brother.

In the end?

The facts had proven that his brother was always right, and an idiot father would always be an idiot\!

The cold father followed behind and sneezed. He felt that the deep forest was gloomy and cold. It was many times colder than the grassland.

His thick mane made his neck feel warm, but his butt was cold.

The cold father turned his head and looked at the human girl. He carefully sized up the gazelle skin tightly wrapped around her and muttered in his heart.

When would that unfilial son give him one too?

The cold father felt that the thick fur on the dead big colorful cat was very suitable for him. If he wore it, it would definitely be very warm and even more majestic.

As long as he did not cover the handsome and domineering mane on his neck.

The mountain path started to become steep.

Chu Xiaoye decided to cross the second mountain.

The little girl could not walk anymore and started to fall behind. She followed silently and went further and further away.

Before Chu Xiaoye could turn around for the third time, Catherine, who was behind him, suddenly turned around and walked back. She stopped in front of the cold father and looked at him coldly.

The cold father stopped in his tracks and looked suspiciously and nervously at the female cub called the Ripper in front of him. His stomach was trembling and he did not know what she was going to do.

Catherine looked past him at the little girl who had fallen at the back.

The meaning was obvious.

"You, go and carry her."

The cold father was stunned at first, but then he flew into a rage. He widened his eyes in anger and bared his fangs in anger. "I'm a dignified lion king, but you actually let that little thing ride me\! Even if I die, I won't be humiliated like this\!"

Catherine looked at him coldly with her dark eyes.

The cold father suddenly roared angrily. He turned around and walked in front of the little girl. He lay down and glared at her. "Little thing, just you wait\!"

"Thank you."

The little girl hesitated for a moment and felt very ashamed. However, if she did not ride on this lion's back, she would probably fall further and further away and eventually die here.

She climbed up the cold father's back and grabbed his lush mane with her two small hands.

The cold father was about to explode in anger, but he had no choice but to stand up and move forward with a heavy load.

Catherine stopped looking at him and returned to the front, following Chu Xiaoye silently.

The cold father looked at her back and said angrily in his heart, "Smelly girl\! Just you wait\! I'll provoke that unfilial son tonight and let him ride you well and teach you a lesson for me\!"

The mountain path was rugged and steep.

The cold father was so tired that he panted heavily. He wished he could lift the little thing on his back and smash her to death.

At this moment, he felt especially sad.

He thought of the dead Callie and the lioness with a broken tail. If they were still here, he could order them to carry this little thing.

Now, he could not command any member of this pride.

He only had Xi'er and Aisha, the two female lions. However, these two female lions were not to be trifled with.

Xi'er had a bad temper and a strong personality. If you dared to bully her, she would dare to fight you to the death. Furthermore, her daughter was not to be trifled with. As for Aisha, that woman, she was even more not to be trifled with. When those two unfilial sons slapped him, he could fly more than ten meters away. He would be lucky if that woman did not take the initiative to bully him.

However, although he could not bully them, there were some things that he could do openly. Those two unfilial sons had no right or reason to interfere\!

Reproducing offspring was the responsibility of lions\!

The female lions and young cubs could only silently endure and watch\!

Soon, the sky turned dark.

Chu Xiaoye found an open space and let the pride stop to rest.

He brought Little Curly Tail and the others and personally patrolled the vicinity to prevent them from being ambushed when they entered the territory of a certain tiger again.

In the forest not far away, he discovered a group of black antelopes, all extremely strong. They were lowering their heads to eat, and they had probably fled from the grassland over there.

Chu Xiaoye immediately split up with Little Curly Tail and the others and surrounded the black antelopes from different directions.

Then, he took the lead and rushed out of the forest with a whoosh. Before the black antelopes could react, he pushed a strong male black antelope to the ground and killed it with his claws.

At the same time, Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, and Molly rushed up and pounced on a black antelope.

The other black antelopes fled in panic.

The pride had many members and a huge appetite. These few were clearly not enough.

After Chu Xiaoye pounced on one, he pounced on the second one.

Under his speed, no matter how agile the black antelopes were, they could not escape.

Soon, they returned with their prey.

However, when they returned to the pride's camp, Chu Xiaoye realized that the atmosphere in the camp was a little strange and abnormally quiet.

Looking in the direction of everyone's gaze, Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that his father was pressing against Maya in front of Qiqi and Nunu, carrying out the great task of reproducing.

Qiqi, Nunu, and the little girl all widened their eyes and waited at the side, looking blankly with confusion and curiosity.

As for his father, he grinned exceptionally sinisterly.

He even turned around and looked meaningfully at him and Little Curly Tail. In the end, his gaze landed on Catherine.

"This old rogue\!"

Chu Xiaoye was furious.
