Chapter 175: The Killing of the Golden Claw\!

On the tree.

Belita suddenly widened her eyes and stood up\!

As for her father, the male leopard, he was so shocked that he almost fell from the tree\!

One of the five Guardian Deities of the blue-eyed lion, the strong lion with astonishing combat strength, actually had his head split open in one slash and died instantly\!

The other lions that were about to surge up were immediately frightened by this terrifying scene and froze in place.

The blue-eyed lion king's expression was stiff, and the muscles at the corner of its eyes twitched non-stop.

The pride that was roaring non-stop instantly fell into a strange silence.

Chu Xiaoye leaned against the tree, his face covered in blood. He slowly raised his right claw, also in disbelief.

At some point in time, a small claw had already grown out from the gaps of his fingers\!

Every claw seemed to be made of gold. From beginning to end, they turned golden\!

Although it was only a short section, its sharpness was not inferior to the previous two golden claws\!

No wonder he always felt his feet heat up during this period of time. Every time he fought, it seemed like some strength was about to surge out from inside.

It turned out that the golden claws were growing\!

Looking at the strong lion in front of him with its skull cut open, he knew that his golden claws had finally been reborn and returned\!

He raised his left palm and looked down. There was also a golden claw that looked like a tender leaf that had just popped out in spring. It grew silently from the gaps of his fingers.

His claws were still hot and his strength surged and roared like a wave\!

The pain in his spine and head was completely washed away by the heat in his body\!

He raised his head and looked at the blue-eyed lion king in front of him. His gaze was like a sharp blade that was sharp and bone-chilling\!

"Roar—"

The blue-eyed lion king suddenly let out a dignified roar, like a thunderclap that rumbled in the ears of every member of the pride. It made their ears buzz and they trembled in fear\!

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

The pride immediately roared and pounced forward\!

Although they were terrified, no one dared to disobey the king's orders\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

The two lions at the front opened their mouths and their entire lower jaws were torn off\!

Just as the surrounding prides were about to pounce on him, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and climbed up the tree behind him with a whoosh. Then, he jumped up and brushed past the heads of the prides, pouncing on the blue-eyed lion king\!

With claws, every tree beside him would be his combat tool\!

The blue-eyed lion king roared angrily. It raised its upper body and swung its right claw ferociously\!

"Bang\!"

The two claws collided heavily\!

Chu Xiaoye flew backward towards the tree behind him. His claws pierced into the hard tree trunk with a whoosh and he hung steadily on the tree\!

The blue-eyed lion king still stood in place.

However, his entire right palm was dripping with blood and badly mutilated. One could almost see the bones inside\!

Because his foot was too big, Chu Xiaoye had already flown out before his sharp and long claws could touch Chu Xiaoye's right claw\!

If this palm landed on the palm of another lion, the bones of the other party's feet would definitely break and he would never be able to stand up again\!

However, Chu Xiaoye's right claw was only numb for a moment before it quickly recovered and was filled with strength again\!

"Roar—"

The pride under the tree raised their heads and roared endlessly\!

Chu Xiaoye was like a spirit monkey. With a whoosh, he climbed onto the branch beside the big tree and jumped horizontally. He actually jumped seven to eight meters away and landed on a big tree in the distance, instantly escaping the encirclement of the pride\!

The pride was stunned for a moment before they immediately roared angrily and quickly surrounded him.

When they ran under the tree, Chu Xiaoye jumped back into the big tree from before.

The pride :"…"

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye used the elasticity of the branch to jump out again and pounced at the blue-eyed lion king\!

The blue-eyed lion king's pupils constricted. His right palm was dripping with blood and burning with pain. He finally retreated for the first time and avoided the sharp edge of the golden claw\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, he could not use the force to fly back to the tree.

He missed and landed on the ground.

Just as he landed, the blue-eyed lion king bared its fangs and pounced forward.

The pride roared and rushed over.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this lion king's strength and weight were extraordinary. He could not tangle with it and bite it, or he would never be able to escape.

He immediately dodged and rushed to the side, charging towards a group of female lions\!

The female lions were originally roaring angrily as they rushed towards him. At this moment, when they saw him suddenly change directions and rush towards them, they were frightened and their formation was in chaos. They turned around and ran\!

"Roar—"

The blue-eyed lion immediately roared and chased after him\!

When he was about to catch up to him, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped towards the big tree beside him. "Smack\!" He suddenly flicked his limbs on the tree trunk and changed directions to pounce on him\!

Its speed was as fast as lightning\!

The blue-eyed lion king was caught off guard and could only raise its sharp claws to slap ferociously\!

However, Chu Xiaoye pounced from the side at an even faster speed\!

Before he could swing his right claw, a heart-wrenching pain suddenly came from his face\!

An entire piece of flesh was scratched off his left cheek, revealing the dense white bones\!

As soon as Chu Xiaoye landed, he rolled out and dodged his right claw and bite, jumping up quickly.

At this moment, the remaining two mighty "Great Deities" roared and pounced forward with the pride\!

Chu Xiaoye's claws flashed with golden light as he faced it\!

He was like an unstoppable sword that carried an incomparably sharp sword light. With a whoosh, he rushed into the pride. He was like a broken bamboo and instantly passed through the pride and stopped behind them\!

The two strong lions at the front were cut open from head to tailbone and entire spine. They instantly fell to the ground and could not stand up again\!

On the path Chu Xiaoye passed, two foreign lions and five female lions were lying on the ground. Some had their heads cut open, some had their mouths cut open, and some had their ribs cut off. They were all on the ground, letting out miserable cries\!

Chu Xiaoye turned around and raised his hot claws. He realized that these golden claws had grown again\!

No lion pounced on him again.

This super pride, which was strong and had an astonishing number of members, made the wandering lions and carnivores around them tremble in fear. Now, there were only ten plus of them left.

Their king, the blue-eyed lion king, actually fled first with its face covered in blood\!

When Chu Xiaoye raised his head again, he could not see the lion king anymore.

As for the remaining female lions, they stayed in place, their eyes terrified and trembling.

Chu Xiaoye knew that from now on, this territory would truly belong to him, and he would become the true king here\!

Just as he thought that this group of female lions were going to stay and pander to him, the new king, the roar of the blue-eyed lion king suddenly came from the grassland.

The female lions immediately woke up and turned to run out of the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and felt a little puzzled.

He defeated the lion king and made it flee. According to the rules passed down by the pride's ancestors, shouldn't these female lions follow him willingly?

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps forward and looked at the grassland outside the bushes.

Under the moonlight and stars, the grassland at night was exceptionally clear.

The ten-over female lions and a few foreign lions hurriedly ran in front of the blue-eyed lion king. They lowered their heads and surrounded it, still respectful and addressing him as king.

The blue-eyed lion king raised its head and looked over, its cold gaze meeting his.

The two lion kings looked at each other from afar, seemingly seeing the emotions in each other's eyes.

In Chu Xiaoye's vision, the blue-eyed lion king walked outside the border marked by the Chino brothers and peed. Then, it looked at him again.

It was as if he was saying, "Kid, this territory belongs to you. However, this King will never forget this hatred\!"

He finally admitted the strength of this foreign little lion and his ownership of this territory that he had arbitrarily divided.

A loss was a loss.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye did not want much territory.

The blue-eyed lion king looked at him for the last time and then left in a sorry state with the remaining lionesses and lions.

In the bushes, there were corpses all over the ground, looking terrifying.

When this super pride finally disappeared from the distant grassland, all the strength and excitement in Chu Xiaoye's body suddenly disappeared.

His limbs felt like jelly. He slowly walked under a big tree and lay down.

Blood had already dried on his head and face.

The pain gradually came, but it was still bearable.

The bitter night had exhausted his strength and spirit. Now that he lay down, he no longer had the strength to stand up.

On the big tree beside him.

The leopard family was still hiding on the tree and did not dare to come down.

They had already transferred all their fear of the super pride to this terrifying little lion.

He was indeed a pervert\!

A little pervert that was even more invincible than that super pride\!

Of course, Belita was not afraid.

"Roar —"

She called out from the branch, bit a few branches, and threw them at Chu Xiaoye, as if she was gloating.

Chu Xiaoye climbed to the ground and did not have any reaction.

Belita saw that he had no strength left. Her eyes turned and she immediately ignored her father and mother's obstruction and climbed down. She let out a roar and looked extremely excited.

She seemed to be saying, "Big fart\! Can't move anymore, right? Haha, I can finally take revenge\!"

Belita jumped down from the tree excitedly and ran behind Chu Xiaoye. Just as she opened her mouth to roar, before she could do anything, there was a bang and black smoke suddenly sprayed on her face and open mouth like the super tail flames when a rocket was fired\!

Since the roar had arrived\!

Belita instantly froze in place, her eyes wide and mouth open as if she was petrified\!

Her entire head and body were wrapped tightly in the black smoke\!
