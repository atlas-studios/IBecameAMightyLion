Chapter 591: The Demon Mosquito Army

"Buzz…"

The buzz was like thunder and the entire sky was covered\!

In the blink of an eye, the dense demon mosquito army came close and started to dive down with a murderous aura, like a black mass of bombers\!

The red-eyed monsters that were crazily slaughtering humans suddenly seemed to have seen an enemy. They immediately raised their heads, waved their claws, and roared angrily.

The demon mosquito army swooped down and instantly drowned the entire town\!

The demon mosquitoes were huge and actually pounced ferociously at the red-eyed monsters like eagles.

Both sides soon fought.

Although those red-eyed monsters were extremely fierce, there were too many demon mosquitoes. Before long, groups of red-eyed monsters fell and their flesh was sucked dry, turning them into dried corpses.

The remaining red-eyed monsters started to escape.

However, the demon mosquitoes were even faster. They immediately rushed up like a rolling wave and pounced forward wave after wave, drowning them.

In less than a moment, the demon mosquitoes flew up again.

As for the remaining red-eyed monsters, they actually fell to the ground and turned into withered corpses.

The people in the town turned pale in fear when they saw this terrifying scene.

"Buzz…"

After killing all the red-eyed monsters, the demon mosquito army immediately pounced at the humans and animals in the town.

"Shoot\! Shoot\! Kill these animals\!"

The soldiers immediately pulled the machine gun with a bang. Many surviving tanks also turned around and aimed at the air, launching artillery.

However, the demon mosquito army was not afraid of death. They roared and rushed towards the soldiers and tanks with guns first.

A soldier was shooting bullets with a machine gun. Two demon mosquitoes fell from the sky and their sharp mouths pierced into his head, numbing his nerves and making him unable to move. In the blink of an eye, they sucked him dry.

More soldiers screamed in fear under the attack of the demon mosquitoes and abandoned their guns to escape.

The tanks also went silent.

The demon mosquitoes pounced on the tanks one after another, surrounding them tightly. The soldiers inside could not see the situation outside.

When they stopped and opened fire, the small demon mosquitoes actually crawled into the cannon and followed the cannon into it.

The entire town was in chaos again.

Humans and animals fled in fear.

The demon mosquito army started to kill crazily\!

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to roar angrily and flee out of the town with Mei Mei, the cold father, and the other ferocious beasts.

When the demon mosquito army discovered the situation and sent out a wave of demon mosquitoes to chase after him, a strong black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye and rushed into the sky\!

The demon mosquitoes that had chased close actually instantly landed as if they had encountered their nemesis.

Chu Xiaoye brought dozens of ferocious beasts and rushed out of the encirclement and the town. Soon, they entered the grassland.

However, the demon mosquitoes still did not let up and buzzed endlessly.

The remaining demon mosquitoes summoned their companions. A few black clouds quickly landed and surrounded them from different directions.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and let all the ferocious beasts approach him and surround him.

A total of five black clouds landed from five directions and surrounded them in the middle.

Chu Xiaoye held his breath and started to hold his breath.

When the five black clouds formed by countless demon mosquitoes pounced at them with a buzz, there was a loud bang\!

A terrifying black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye\!

The black smoke surged out like a huge wave and instantly enveloped all the ferocious beasts.

At the same time, black fog rushed into the sky and continued to be confused.

The five black clouds formed by the demon mosquitoes were instantly submerged.

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

Many ferocious beasts started to vomit\!

Only the cold father and Mei Mei had already held their breaths.

The buzzing demon mosquitoes around him soon stopped talking.

When the terrifying black smoke quickly dispersed, these ferocious beasts were shocked to discover that the densely packed and countless terrifying demon mosquitoes actually overlapped and fell to the ground, completely dead\!

None of them were alive\!

What a terrifying fart\!

The dozens of ferocious beasts looked at the golden lion king beside them in shock.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and ran on the grassland with them.

Humans, red-eyed monsters, and demon mosquitoes, the war between them had nothing to do with him.

He wanted to bring Mei Mei and the cold father away from here and never return.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Gunshots suddenly sounded from afar.

At the same time, the roars of many lions sounded\!

When Chu Xiaoye ran over with the cold father and the others, he suddenly saw a super pride with hundreds of members\!

However, this super pride was running towards them in panic and fear.

Behind them were three jeeps with humans standing on them and machine guns.

The machine guns were shooting flames and bullets.

Lions fell one after another, and blood dyed a large patch of grass red.

When this super pride was about to charge close, Chu Xiaoye suddenly opened his mouth and let out a terrifying roar\!

The mutated Lion King Roar brought with it a violent air wave that surged forward like a tide\!

The running lions were pushed to the ground.

The people chasing in the three jeeps behind suddenly felt a sharp pain in their eardrums and their heads were buzzing. For a moment, they were seeing stars and were on the verge of collapse\!

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

The glass on the jeep was actually shattered by this sound wave\!

Chu Xiaoye roared again and shot out like an arrow, charging towards the three jeeps\!

Mei Mei, the cold father, and the twenty-over ferocious beasts followed behind him and roared as they rushed up.

"Boom\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and hit the side of one of the jeeps heavily with his head\!

The jeep that was still driving was knocked to the side.

Before the humans in the car could wake up, Mei Mei, the cold father, and the ferocious beasts had already pounced on them. They swung their claws and opened their bloody mouths to take revenge\!

Chu Xiaoye rushed towards the second jeep again and swung his claws. With a bang, he actually flipped the jeep to the ground.

At this moment, many lions in the super pride had already got up from the ground and rushed over, pouncing on the humans.

The remaining jeep started to accelerate and flee crazily.

However, on this grassland, no matter how fast it was, where could it escape to?

"Pfft—"

A stream of air suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye. His entire huge body actually instantly jumped dozens of meters away with a whoosh. In the blink of an eye, he caught up to the jeep that had fled with the accelerator and landed on it\!

"Bang\!"

The four tires of the jeep were crushed and the entire body of the jeep collapsed.

Before the driver could extend his gun out the window, Chu Xiaoye had already smashed the roof of the car with his claw and pressed him against the wheel, causing his head to explode.

Mei Mei and the cold father rushed over. Many lions rushed over and started to kill the remaining humans.

Chu Xiaoye got down from the car and stood at the side, watching silently.

When the humans on the three jeeps were completely slaughtered, the pride made way. A tall and strong black-haired lion walked out and came in front of Chu Xiaoye. He looked at him, at the cold father, and at Mei Mei.

The cold father recognized him at a glance.

This was his son, Lars.

The world was in chaos, and even the once quiet grassland was in chaos.

In order to survive, they had no choice but to find new territory.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the tired and confused super pride in front of him. These lions might be the only lions left on the grassland in the past.

This might be the last fire seed of the remaining lions in this world\!

He had to bring them to the new world and continue to reproduce.

The sky was dark, but there was still light ahead\!
