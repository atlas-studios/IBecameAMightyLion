Chapter 539: Turning into Enemies

"Night, I hope that you will occasionally learn to obey."

Carter slowed down and said, "At least in front of so many people."

She was the leader of an army of more than thirty thousand people and the high and mighty queen. She needed absolute dignity and authority. Naturally, she did not want to be doubted, refuted, or even reprimanded by a youth in front of so many people.

Chu Xiaoye did not say anything else and looked at the girl named Doya with trembling eyes.

The former lioness cub called Doya died miserably in front of him. Now, he would not allow such a thing to happen again.

He got down from the horse and walked over.

Mormont knelt on one knee and hugged his granddaughter, his face pale.

This was not the Princess Carter he knew in the past. He was sure.

Although the previous Princess Carter was warlike and ambitious, she would never be so cruel and heartless.

The old man raised his head and saw the young elf standing in front of him.

"Give it to me."

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the ground and carried the girl from his arms. Then, he lowered his head and covered the wound on the girl's neck with his mouth.

This was not a fatal wound. As long as the wound did not bleed anymore, there was still hope.

Carter's slash was not deep.

Mormont looked at him in shock, a puzzled expression on his face. However, he did not stop him. Furthermore, he raised his hand and told the other grandchildren behind him to not interfere.

Carter's eyes revealed a cold glint and he said angrily, "Ye, are you deliberately going against me?"

Chu Xiaoye still hugged the girl in his arms and ignored her.

"Your Majesty, should we attack?"

The orc generals surrounding them held their weapons and waited for orders.

Lanisi brought the elf girls down from the horse and protected Chu Xiaoye and the girl in the middle.

Catherine walked close to Carter and looked at him coldly.

Carter looked at her too.

The two pairs of eyes collided, as if they had returned to the grassland and the scene when they were in the pride.

Carter thought of the past and the coldness in his eyes gradually disappeared.

"Don't do it again."

She said coldly and turned to get on the horse.

The blood from the young girl's wound finally stopped flowing. She had been opening her eyes the entire time, looking at the young elf who was hugging her in confusion.

Chu Xiaoye left her neck, his mouth covered in blood. He thought to himself, Maya… I owe you this…

He handed the girl in his arms to the old man and said, "She should be fine. Apply some medicine and bandage her."

Mormont took his granddaughter and looked at the blood that had suddenly coagulated at the wound, his eyes filled with disbelief.

He looked up at the elf youth in front of him. Before he could thank him, the youth suddenly got up, pulled out the sword at his waist, and pointed it at Princess Carter—his queen.

"Carter, accept five thousand troops and those gold coins and leave from the road beside."

Chu Xiaoye pointed the sword in his hand at Carter, who was on the horse. However, because he was too short, the sharp tip of the sword only pointed at Carter's thigh.

Carter looked at him with a dark expression in disbelief.

The few orc generals immediately surrounded him and roared, "Put down your swords\!"

Lanisi, Vilis, and the others protected Chu Xiaoye.

It seemed that no matter what he did, these elf girls would always protect him.

Chu Xiaoye did not put down the sword. The sword in his hand pierced through Carter's pants and the cold tip of the sword was pressed against her warm skin. He looked at her coldly and said, "I'm not joking. Carter, take the stuff and leave quickly."

Carter sat motionless on the horse and gritted her teeth. "You're betraying me. Do you know that?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said, "I only know that there are some things that can be done, but there are some things that can't be done. Even if you want to fight for supremacy, even if it's for your ideals, you can't do whatever you want."

"I'll kill you and your elf harem\! Do you believe me?"

Carter's eyes spat flames and she looked furious.

Chu Xiaoye nodded and looked at her with a complicated gaze. "I didn't believe it previously, but now, I believe it. However, Princess Carter, you know my speed better than anyone. My sword or my claws will definitely make you regret it before your people attack. You should know that, right?"

Carter closed her eyes. After a long time, she opened them again and looked at him coldly. "From today onwards, I'm me and you're you. We're no longer related."

She paused for a moment and said, "Actually, from the moment I saw you, I knew that we were not walking in the same direction. You will never be able to walk on my path, and I will never be able to change you. Night, you will regret it. This is not the grassland, and you are not a lion now. Reality will let you understand that your soft-heartedness and mercy will make you lose more chances to be stronger and more family and friends."

"Here, only by being strong can you be eternal\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not speak. He retracted his sword an inch and said coldly, "Thank you for the reminder. You should go, Alisa."

Carter looked at him with a complicated gaze and said, "Yes, you should go, King."

With that said, she turned her horse and walked towards the main road beside the city. She said coldly, "Lord Mormont, I'm waiting for your gift on the way. If there's one less, I'm sorry."

The orc army followed behind her and left majestically.

Chu Xiaoye and the elf girls stood in place and watched their backs gradually disappear.

Mormont narrowed his eyes and suddenly sighed. He looked at the young elf in front of him and said, "You can't interfere in this matter."

With that said, the young orcs behind him suddenly pulled out the swords at their waists and surrounded Chu Xiaoye and the others.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the old man in front of him with a puzzled expression.

Mormont raised his hand. Densely packed archers suddenly appeared on the quiet city wall. The citizens who were freely moving around the city gate suddenly took out their weapons and looked over with a murderous aura.

"Young man, you're being kind, but you ruined our plans."

Mormont had a regretful expression as he shrugged and said, "The City Lord of Bingluo City has changed long ago. I, an old man about to die, and a few young people are just bait. It's nothing even if Princess Carter kills us all. Sigh…"

Fei'er protected Chu Xiaoye and said angrily, "You baddies\! You're biting the hand that feeds you\!"

Mormont had a bitter expression. "There's nothing we can do. Before Princess Carter arrived, this city had already been occupied by the Lusni family. I'm doing this for the sake of the citizens."

The girl who had been saved by Chu Xiaoye lowered her head and said with a painful expression, "The 50,000-strong army is all the army of the Lusni family. My grandfather originally would rather die than submit… Sorry…"

"Let's go in, children."

Mormont's wrinkled old face revealed a self-mocking expression. "Perhaps, they can let us go after obtaining the army and money."

After dark.

The Carter army, which was only a kilometer away from Bingluo City, suddenly stopped in a col.

"Your Majesty, do you need to wait for Lord Mormont's gift?"

The orc general asked.

Carter sat on her warhorse and looked back. She could not see the tall and majestic city anymore.

"Split up into four teams. The cavalry will be in one team and follow behind me\! The other two teams will ambush in the forest on both sides and listen to my signal\! The remaining team will wait on the main road on the slope\! Workers will immediately cut down the trees and make fake humans to stick them on the main road\!"

"Yes\!"
