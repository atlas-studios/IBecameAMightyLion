Chapter 216: The Lion King's Wound

 They continued forward.

Now, the three lions no longer looked down on this young leader.

Even their king would not be able to kill the powerful hyena queen so easily in a hyena pack.

Clearly, this young leader was not weaker than their king.

The lioness cub beside him that was always by his side was not to be underestimated.

As for the male leopard, it looked very strong.

This strange combination was clearly not as weak as they had imagined. Instead, it was exceptionally strong and unfathomable.

However, even so, they would not betray their king.

Even if their king abandoned them last night.

A familiar roar suddenly came from the forest ahead.

The three lions were delighted when they heard that and immediately ran over.

When they ran past Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, who was following behind him, suddenly popped out her claws, her eyes revealing a cold light.

When she was about to rush out, Chu Xiaoye swung his tail and slapped her face gently, signaling her that she did not have to do this.

The murderous Catherine immediately stopped and calmed down. She looked at his tail with watery eyes and lowered her eyes.

In the forest ahead.

Fresh blood covered the ground and corpses lay everywhere.

The three baboons were already dead.

Other than their corpses, there were also the corpses of seven to eight sea pythons.

At this moment, the tall mixed fur lion king was tightly wrapped around a big tree by three thick sea pythons. The other sea pythons were pouncing forward from different directions to bite.

The mixed fur lion king struggled with all its might as it counterattacked with its sharp fangs.

His body was riddled with wounds and covered in blood.

Clearly, he and the three baboons had been ambushed by the sea pythons.

In this lush forest, facing this group of many soft creatures, he, the lion king, could not even use half of his abilities.

At this moment, he only had one sharp tooth left and could retaliate.

The teeth of this group of sea pythons were filled with venom. Although the venom was not very strong, after being bitten so many times, he could not help but feel a little dizzy and weak.

He originally thought that he was going to die here. Just as he was about to bite two more enemies to death, he suddenly heard a few roars from the forest. Then, his three subordinates ran over at lightning speed.

At the same time, the young lion rushed over with his team.

For a moment, the mixed fur lion king was stunned and did not know what to do.

"Roarâ€”"

The three lions immediately rushed up and bit the attacking sea pythons ferociously.

Chu Xiaoye also brought Catherine and quickly rushed over. He slashed the heads of the few sea pythons with his claws.

Blue pounced in front of the lion king and opened his mouth. With a crack, he bit off the head of a sea python that was wrapped around his body\!

At this moment, the female lion also came to the side of the mixed fur lion king. She mimicked Blue and bit the head of a sea python, biting down fiercely\!

The remaining sea python was terrified. It hurriedly released its body and prepared to escape\! 

At this moment, the two strong warthogs suddenly rushed up. Their sharp fangs pierced through its head and body with a "chi" and threw it into the air.

In a moment, all the sea pythons were eliminated, not a single one left.

The mixed fur lion king finally broke free.

His majestic mane was covered in blood and his fur was messy. His legs, butt, and even face were bitten.

It was difficult to support alone and difficult to clap alone.

No matter how powerful he was, he could not fight so many enemies here. It was inevitable that he would be injured. Even losing his life was something that could happen in an instant.

His dignity and pride as a lion king would only pull him closer to death in this land and in front of these enemies.

Here, without a team, they could only die.

At this moment, he seemed to have woken up.

He looked at the female lion in front of him, at the three lions not far away, at the young lion king and his subordinates. He was in a daze for a moment, then slowly lowered his head.

He panted heavily and squatted under the tree.

After a moment of silence, he suddenly raised his head again, as if he had thought of something. He looked suspiciously at the lioness in front of him and the wounds on her body.

The wound had already become a scar.

The fatal wound on his hind leg had already healed.

The lioness, who had been crippled last night and could not stand up and could only wait for death, was already full of energy. Her sprint and killing the enemy just now were also so agile and full of strength.

It had only been a night.

How did she come back to life and return to normal?

The female lion lowered her head and was still very respectful to him, but her eyes revealed a trace of coldness.

She turned around and walked towards Chu Xiaoye, standing behind him silently.

The mixed fur lion king was stunned and looked at the young lion. There was no anger, no jealousy, only shock and confusion.

Was he the one who did all this?

The lion king was stunned for a moment before looking at his three subordinates.

Although the injuries on the three lions were not as serious as that of the female lions, they could not walk freely without a few days.

That was why he could not wait to leave last night.

But now, the three of them seemed to be uninjured. They were still agile and could come and go freely.

What was going on?

The three lions growled and looked at Chu Xiaoye, as if they were apologizing.

They could not betray their king.

The mixed fur lion king was seriously injured and its entire body was covered in wounds. It could not walk for the time being. It would at least rest for two days. Its situation was so similar to that of the three lions last night.

Last night, he abandoned them and left alone.

Now, even if they abandoned him, there was nothing to blame.

However, the three lions clearly had no intention of abandoning him.

They picked up the sea python's corpse and walked in front of him, placing the food there. Then, they split into three directions and lay at the side, protecting him silently.

The mixed fur lion king lowered its head and looked blankly at the sea python corpse in front of it.

Then, he raised his head and looked at the young lion.

Chu Xiaoye did not leave.

He was eating fresh sea python meat.

He did not like to eat these things, but he had no choice. He had to eat and maintain sufficient strength at all times.

Catherine looked at him and knew how he felt. She lay on the ground silently.

The female lion was stunned for a moment. She looked at him deeply and lay down too.

Blue did not like to stay on the ground.

He bit a sea python and climbed up the tree.

As for the two warthogs, they started to dig for plant roots nearby.

Obviously, they were not prepared to leave immediately.

The mixed fur lion king looked at them and was stunned for a long time. Then, it slowly lowered its head.
