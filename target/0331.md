Chapter 331: Tricked

The night quickly passed.

The blood all over the ground did not attract other carnivores.

The powerful aura of the pride deterred all the animals in the forest.

After dawn.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately brought Little Curly Tail and the others to the forest in front of him.

Most of the black lions' positions in ambush had been remembered from last night's observation.

The trap on the ground was also very obvious.

Chu Xiaoye walked straight towards a dense patch of bushes.

Just as they walked close, a few black lions suddenly roared angrily and jumped out. They had fierce expressions and bared their fangs and claws\!

However, before they could approach, Little Curly Tail's tail slapped them.

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

With a few crisp sounds, the few lions that had just pounced into the air fell to the ground in a sorry state.

Catherine and Mei Mei had already rushed up, cut open their stomachs, and sent them to their deaths\!

These few lions were not as strong as the lion last night. Under this attack, they could not resist at all and died.

The other black lions hiding not far away got up and fled in panic when they saw this scene.

These few young lions were clearly not people they could provoke.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

The scent of the pride grew stronger and stronger. Clearly, a large number of black lions were gathered in front of him.

This was already the forest at the edge of the oasis.

All the black lions were gathered here to delay time for their king.

"Roar—"

An angry roar\!

The grass swayed and a few tall black lions jumped out.

Then, more black lions rushed out.

There were lions, female lions, and some young lions. There were about forty to fifty of them, and all of them were strong and looked extremely fierce.

These black lions immediately surrounded them, bared their fangs, and revealed a fierce expression.

Chu Xiaoye looked up ahead.

The black lion king still did not appear.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail could not wait anymore and attacked first. He swung his tail and slapped the head of a black lion. Before the other party could fall to the ground, he wrapped his tail around its neck with a whoosh.

Then, he swung this lion and rushed towards the pride.

The black lion pride was in chaos.

Catherine and Mei Mei rushed up and took the opportunity to kill him.

Tilly rushed towards the few lions that appeared first. She could tell that these few lions were the leaders of this team.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and did not move, looking solemnly at a bush in front of him.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as Tilly rushed in front of the lions, a figure suddenly jumped out of the bushes. With a bang, he actually sent Tilly flying with a claw.

Chu Xiaoye's pupils constricted. He hurriedly ran a few steps, jumped back, and hugged Tilly in his arms, landing steadily on the ground.

Tilly was pressed under him and looked at him with her eyes wide open. Her eyes were filled with confusion. She was clearly stunned by the slap.

This was a good thing.

If that slap had landed on another lion, the lion's bones would have broken and it would have died\!

This little white lion's physique was extremely strong.

Chu Xiaoye got up and rushed towards the attacker.

It was an even taller and stronger black lion that was almost as big as mixed fur. Its eyes were suffused with a cold green light and its face was covered in scars. It looked rather ferocious.

"Roar—"

When the other lions saw him charging over, they immediately roared angrily and pounced forward.

Then, blood splashed everywhere and miserable cries rang out endlessly\!

Chu Xiaoye's speed already prevented them from reacting. His sharp golden claws cut through their fur and bones like sharp blades\!

The lions fell to the ground and let out miserable cries. Blood sprayed from their wounds and their bones were dense.

Chu Xiaoye rushed towards the largest black lion.

When the black lion saw him pounce over, it did not fight. Instead, it suddenly turned around and ran towards the forest behind.

Chu Xiaoye chased for a few steps and suddenly turned around. He ignored him and waved his golden claws, quickly killing the black lions here.

Half of the black pride quickly fell.

The ground was filled with corpses and the forest was filled with cries. The air was filled with the smell of blood.

The lion that Little Curly Tail used his tail to wrap around had already been badly mutilated by the collision and did not look good.

The lion that had its stomach cut open by Catherine lay on the ground and wailed miserably.

Mei Mei's light blue claws shattered the spines of the lions and female lions. They fell to the ground and could not stand up again.

The young lions were already terrified. They watched from the side, not caring if they came up again.

Tilly waved her golden claws and moved around the forest like a ghost. Wherever she passed, blood splashed and the lion's head fell to the ground.

When Chu Xiaoye joined the slaughter, the black lions were even more miserable.

The black lion leader, who was about to lure him away, was furious when it saw that he did not fall for it. It immediately turned around and returned, pouncing on him again.

Chu Xiaoye pretended to be focused on dealing with the other two black lions and did not look back.

When the tall black lion leader ran close and thought that there was a chance to take advantage of it, he opened his bloody mouth and pounced ferociously from behind. Chu Xiaoye curled his tail and suddenly spat out a black stream of air from behind with a puff\!

The black lion leader's wide mouth was instantly filled with black smoke\!

At the same time, the fur on his face and the mane on his neck were blown back by the powerful airflow. His entire face trembled and distorted\! Even the tongue in his mouth was blown out of his mouth and flew back from the corner of his mouth. He looked like a husky that had been attacked by a storm\!

"Bang\!"

The black lion leader was caught off guard and was sent flying by the airflow, landing heavily on the ground.

He suddenly jumped up. Just as he was about to open his mouth and roar, he vomited a lot of vomit from his mouth. Furthermore, the vomit was turned black by the black smoke\!

"Ugh —"

As if he had pulled open a gate, after the first mouthful was spat out, endless filth started to flow out of his throat\!

The black lion leader opened his mouth and vomited non-stop\!

In an instant, he was dizzy, his limbs felt like jelly, and his mind was blank.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

His head was cut in half\!

The black lion leader fell to the ground, widened his eyes, and split his head open. However, vomiting still surged out of his throat. He still let out vomiting sounds. Every time he vomited, his body would twitch and he looked miserable and comical.

This powerful black lion probably never would have thought that he would die in such a grievance and humiliation\!

Chu Xiaoye did not look at him much and immediately turned around to charge at the remaining black lions.

In the blink of an eye, only a few of the nearly fifty black lions were left. The terrified black lions that were fleeing also died under Tilly's sharp claws.

The ground was covered in black corpses.

Chu Xiaoye was merciless. He killed the remaining black lions without leaving a single one alive\!

The lion on Little Curly Tail's tail was only left with a bloody tail. His entire body had been smashed into pieces and the grass was covered.

The black lion that was still lying on the ground and not completely dead wailed in despair, begging for mercy.

Catherine and Mei Mei walked over and silenced her with a slap.

A strong smell of blood filled the entire forest.

All the black lions fell, but the black lion king still did not appear.

Hundreds of meters ahead, they were already at the edge of the oasis.

Chu Xiaoye did not relax his vigilance. Instead, his vigilance grew stronger.

After a short rest, he continued forward with Little Curly Tail and the others.

After walking for more than 100 meters, a rocky hill suddenly appeared in front of him.

All sorts of rocks were piled up there, forming a barren area in the oasis.

A cave appeared on the rocky hill. The entrance was dark and quiet, making it difficult to see clearly.

Even Chu Xiaoye could not see clearly what was inside. He could only see a black passageway.

Clearly, the cave was very deep.

The black lion king might be hiding inside healing.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately walked over with Little Curly Tail and the others.

When they came close to the cave, they could clearly smell the lion's scent coming from inside.

Chu Xiaoye looked into the cave. The passageway inside was narrow and only enough for a lion to pass through. The other members could only follow behind.

This way, if the black lion king guarded inside, there would be no way out.

It was useless for them to enter in unison. Only he, who was walking in front, could fight. The members following behind could not attack at all.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment at the entrance of the cave and turned to look at Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and the others, letting them guard here.

He decided to enter for a distance and see the situation inside.

If it was still so narrow inside, he could only think of other ways.

After reminding Little Curly Tail and the others, Chu Xiaoye immediately entered the cave.

Catherine hesitated for a moment and wanted to follow, but Chu Xiaoye seemed to have sensed her. He immediately turned around and looked at her solemnly.

If there was danger inside and he wanted to turn around and run out, he could rush out very quickly. If the other members followed behind, his speed would be much slower.

It was not that he was trying to be brave, but the terrain in the cave made him make this decision.

Seeing that he was looking at her, Catherine could only lower her head and wait at the entrance of the cave.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light as he looked at the darkness inside and continued forward.

"Boom\!"

Right at this moment, a loud bang suddenly came from the top of the cave behind him\!

Then, a huge rock suddenly fell from above and instantly sealed the hole\!

Then, more rocks fell from above\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and could only run forward. Rocks rolled behind him, sealing all his retreat\!

Above him, the prideful roar and slap of the black lion king could be heard\!

It turned out that this cave was actually a trap\!

The black lion king was not inside.

Catherine and the others, who were guarding the entrance, saw that the rocks in the cave were blocking the cave. Their expressions changed and they hurriedly went up to slap the huge rocks, but they realized that the huge rock was already embedded tightly in the narrow cave and did not move at all\!

In front of this huge rock, there were even more boulders blocking the passageway\!

In the blink of an eye, Chu Xiaoye was completely sealed inside\!

Rocks were still falling from the cave. They rumbled endlessly and the entire rocky hill was almost shaking.

"Chi\!"

Catherine's silver claws pierced into the huge rock blocking the entrance of the cave and she started to dig at the rock with all her might, wanting to break it with her claws.

However, although her claws were sharp and could pierce through rocks, this rock was too big and hard. When her claws pierced in and she exerted strength, her flesh was also rubbing and exerting strength.

Soon, her two claws were dripping with blood.

However, she still dug with all her might, her gaze determined and her movements fierce. She did not stop at all\!

Little Curly Tail immediately swung his tail and slapped it. The stone fragments flew and dust flew, but he did not shatter the rock.

Mei Mei also raised her claws and started digging.

Tilly suddenly jumped up and landed on the top of the cave, quickly rushing out.

She could already smell the black lion king.

At this moment, the black lion king was standing on a rock not far away, roaring softly with a pleased expression. His claws slapped the ground again and again.

He had already set up many rocks in the cave and some terrifying killers. The young lion king could not escape even if he had wings\!

"Whoosh\!"

Tilly ran away, suddenly jumped up, and pounced on him. Her golden claws flickered charmingly in the sun.

The black lion king raised its head and looked at her with disdain, but ignored her.

"Whoosh\!"

A black shadow suddenly flew out from behind the rock beside him and hit Tilly with a bang\!

Tilly was caught off guard and was sent flying.

Just as she fell to the ground, another black shadow rushed out from behind the rock beside her. Its huge claws were raised up and it suddenly slapped her head\!

The wind howled and the sun was blocked\!

Tilly hurriedly rolled on the ground a few times and jumped up.

"Bang\!"

The black shadow's claws slapped the ground heavily and the rocks on the ground shattered\!

The ground seemed to tremble.

Two slender black female lions stood on either side of Tilly, looking at her coldly. Their faces did not seem to have any expression.

Tilly's gaze was grave. She knew that she had encountered a strong enemy. She narrowed her eyes and waited solemnly.

"Whoosh\!"

The two black female lions suddenly turned into two afterimages and shot towards her\!

Tilly jumped up and dodged their attacks from the left and right. As soon as she landed, she jumped back and shot towards one of the female lions like a dragonfly touching the water\!

Golden light flashed and killing intent surged\!

Not far away, the black lion king had already disappeared.

At the entrance, Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei were digging the rock with all their might. A few tall and strong black figures were already standing behind them.

This was the true expert of the black lion tribe\!

Little Curly Tail did not look back. He suddenly swung his tail and slapped one of the black lions with a whoosh\!

As for the black lion, it did not dodge or retreat. It raised its claws and caught his tail steadily with a bang. Then, like a monkey's palm, it grabbed his tail tightly\!

Little Curly Tail was shocked. Just as he was about to retract his tail, the black lion suddenly yanked and Little Curly Tail flew up with a whoosh. He was thrown more than ten meters away and landed heavily on a rock. He was immediately dizzy from the impact and his entire body was in pain. He almost could not get up.

Fortunately, his physique was strong and his recovery ability was very strong.

A few seconds later, he stood up.

However, the powerful black lion was already shooting over like an arrow that had been released\!

It was extremely fast\!

"Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail had just stood up when he was slapped away\!

The black lion followed closely\!

Just as he was about to hit another rock heavily, he suddenly swung his tail with a whoosh and wrapped it around the black lion's neck. He used the force to swing\!

Not only did it reduce the strength on him, it also turned the strength back to the black lion\!

"Bam\!"

The black lion could not stand steadily and was dragged to the ground by his tail.

At the same time, Little Curly Tail landed on the ground.

Before the black lion could open its mouth to bite, Little Curly Tail suddenly used strength and sent him flying\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The powerful black lion started to dance in the sky.

Then, there was a loud bang\!

Little Curly Tail smashed him towards a rock in front of him\!

The black lion was dizzy. It had all its abilities, but it was powerless in midair\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail continued to swing it and smashed it fiercely at the surrounding rocks\!

Finally, this powerful black lion's brain splashed everywhere, its bones broke, its internal organs shattered, and blood flowed from its seven apertures. It was completely dead\!
