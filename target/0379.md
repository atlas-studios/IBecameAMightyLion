Chapter 379: Untitled

"Moo—"

The water buffaloes were furious. They immediately lowered their heads and lined up\!

The female lion did not have any fear and still rushed over quickly. Just as she was about to approach the water buffaloes, she suddenly jumped up and jumped high, landing on the back of one of them.

The water buffalo was shocked and furious. As it jumped and ran, it wanted to throw her down.

The other water buffaloes surrounded them. Although they were furious, they were at a loss.

The female lion stood steadily on the water buffalo's back. Her four sharp claws pierced into the water buffalo's flesh. She turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye with slightly scarlet eyes. She suddenly roared, as if she was challenging him.

She recognized the king of this pride at a glance.

Her goal was to defeat the king of this territory and completely occupy this territory and this pride\!

The members beside Chu Xiaoye looked at her in shock.

Although this lioness was very powerful, had she forgotten that she was only a lioness?

The water buffalo jumped and carried her, charging towards them.

The other water buffaloes followed closely and ran over angrily.

Was she going to use the buffalo's might to fight?

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and immediately growled. He let the other members leave with the two water buffaloes' corpses on the ground and fought alone.

This female lion gave him a hint.

Although the water buffaloes were terrifyingly lethal, they were helpless against the enemy standing on their backs. No matter how angry they were, they could not deal with them.

Towards his orders, Little Curly Tail and the others were hesitant.

Facing the aggressive herd, they were unwilling to leave, let alone leave him to fight the enemy.

In order to dispel their worries, Chu Xiaoye suddenly dashed towards the ferocious herd at his fastest speed. Then, he suddenly jumped up and flew high, landing on the back of a water buffalo and standing there steadily.

"Roar—"

He turned around and roared at Little Curly Tail and the others again, urging them to leave.

Under the threat of the water buffaloes, their existence would not give him much help. Instead, they would drag him down and distract him.

Blue Eyes trusted him very much and knew that with his strength, he could definitely retreat unscathed. Therefore, he immediately growled and took the lead to bite the water buffalo corpse and quickly escape.

Mixed Fur looked at the water buffaloes and immediately went over to help.

With the cooperation of these two strong lions that were huge and weighed almost 1,000 kilograms, the water buffalo on the ground was easily dragged away.

Seeing that his brother was staring at him sternly, Little Curly Tail could only swing his tail and wrap it around the neck of another water buffalo, dragging it away.

The Jerry brothers helped from the left and right.

Mei Mei was injured and followed behind. She looked at Chu Xiaoye worriedly and roared at the water buffaloes as she quickly retreated.

Catherine was nowhere to be seen.

The two water buffaloes that Chu Xiaoye and the female lion used as mounts suddenly stopped in place and started to jump and shake their bodies crazily. They even lowered their heads and hit each other, as if they wanted to use this method to bump the lions on their backs down.

However, Chu Xiaoye's golden claws and the female lion's claws were deeply scratched in their flesh. Their entire bodies stood very steadily on it.

The other water buffaloes mooed and surrounded the two water buffaloes in the middle. They kept running around anxiously, occasionally looking like they were preparing to sprint and hit, as if they wanted to scare the two lions on their backs.

The huge and brave water buffalo army was in chaos at this moment, not knowing what to do.

"Whoosh\!"

The female lion suddenly let go of her claws, jumped up, and pounced at Chu Xiaoye.

His movements were swift and fierce\!

Chu Xiaoye also jumped up and pounced at her.

The two figures suddenly passed each other and agilely avoided the other party's claws. No part of their bodies touched.

As for the two water buffaloes, they thought that they had finally obtained freedom. Just as they were about to swing their tails and run away, they suddenly realized that their backs hurt again and another figure jumped up.

Chu Xiaoye and the female lion tacitly switched mounts.

The two water buffaloes were shocked and furious. They jumped and swayed crazily again, as if they were crazy. The surrounding water buffaloes avoided them in fear.

"Bang\!"

The water buffalo Chu Xiaoye was standing on suddenly bent its knees and knelt on the ground. Then, its body tilted and it fell to the ground, preparing to roll on the ground.

Such a huge monster would rarely take the initiative to lie on the ground and give predators a chance. However, at this moment, it had completely lost its mind.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not take the opportunity to kill it. Instead, the moment it fell to the ground, he suddenly jumped up and pounced at the female lion.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed as fast as lightning\!

However, the female lion reacted extremely quickly and jumped onto the back of another water buffalo at the side.

As for Chu Xiaoye, his golden claw pierced into the water buffalo's spine with a whoosh. Like a sharp blade cutting into tofu, it cut the water buffalo's spine into two\!

"Bang\!"

The water buffalo immediately wailed. Its limbs turned limp and it fell to the ground with a bang.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and rushed into the sky like a goshawk in a black shadow. He landed ferociously and pounced at the female lion again.

The female lion knew how powerful his golden claws were. She jumped up again and landed on the back of another water buffalo.

Chu Xiaoye had just landed when he suddenly turned and pounced at her again.

The female lion's eyes flickered as she jumped up again and jumped towards a water buffalo further away.

She seemed to be preparing to expend the young lion king's strength.

However, she never would have thought that Chu Xiaoye's two moves were just a pretense.

When she jumped up again and jumped towards the water buffalo further away, a stream of air suddenly ran out from behind Chu Xiaoye. Her body, which was already exhausted and was about to land, suddenly flew straight out again. Furthermore, she was many times faster than before\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye attacked later and caught up to her in an instant. Just as he was about to jump past her, his sharp claws suddenly pierced into her back\!

Just as she was about to rely on her terrifying speed to cut off her entire spine, this female lion suddenly swung her tail and slapped Chu Xiaoye's crotch loudly\!

"Roar—"

A miserable scream suddenly sounded in the night\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye was like a plane that was shooting with full power. The engine suddenly exploded and his body suddenly lost all its momentum. He landed vertically and fell, landing heavily on the grass.
