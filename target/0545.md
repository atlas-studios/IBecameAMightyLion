Chapter 545: Past and Present Life

At dawn.

The ferocious fire dragon spread its wings and carried Chu Xiaoye and the others from the top of the highest castle in Bingluo City. It flew into the sky and quickly left.

Outside the city.

Carter sat on the horse and watched the figure of the fire dragon gradually disappear. Only when it disappeared did he turn around and rush to the capital of the Kast Empire with the army with a murderous aura.

Doya sat in front of the fire dragon and directed this hot-tempered fellow.

Their journey was smooth. They would occasionally encounter a few fire dragons in the sky and were quite familiar with this fellow. They did not stop or give out alarms.

Soon, they flew out of the Kast Empire's map.

However, not long after they crossed the border and arrived above a forest with rolling mountains, two pterosaurs suddenly rose from the forest and let out sharp cries.

On one of the pterodactyls sat a young orc with a spear.

When they came close, the orc youth cupped his hands and said, "So it's Miss Doya from Bingluo City. Where are you going?"

Doya said politely, "Sorry, because it was rather urgent, I was not informed beforehand. Father ordered me to go to Rand Island to collect something, so I need to go over from above your country. Please report to General Mofat, my lord."

The orc youth hurriedly said respectfully, "Miss Doya, you're too polite. The general was very satisfied with your deal last time. He even said that he would definitely go to your city to thank you personally the next time he has the time. I'll go report to the general and send out the Thousand Li Falcon to inform the people in front so as to not delay Miss Doya's time."

Doya smiled and said, "Thank you, Your Excellency."

The orc youth hurriedly left with the other pterodactyl.

Doya explained to Chu Xiaoye, who was behind her, "Our Bingluo City has business with many countries. Back then, when their General Mofat suppressed the rebellion, he urgently needed weapons and armor. We helped them transport it urgently without them paying in advance and the price was very low. Therefore, that General Mofat is grateful to my grandfather. Their country is neighboring to our Kast Empire and has always had a good relationship. Therefore, our pterodactyls can fly over them very safely."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but sigh. "It's good to be rich. Even the airspace of other countries can be used at any time without being told in advance. Speaking of which, Doya, how much wealth does your Bingluo City have?"

This was a very sensitive topic, and they had only known each other for a few days.

Chu Xiaoye was just asking casually and did not expect this girl to answer. Just as he was about to ask about something else, Doya said seriously, "Actually, I'm not too sure. I only know that my father manages the finances of Bingluo City. He once told me that even if the entire castle was filled, it might not be able to hold it. Therefore, our gold coins are stored in the safest place, and some liquid funds are left in Bingluo City."

"Can't… can't fit the entire castle?"

Chu Xiaoye thought of the tall castle in the middle of Bingluo City with a shocked expression.

Was this the so-called super-rich, rich beyond compare?

Doya continued, "Actually, Bingluo City is only a very small place. In many countries, we have rented cities and bought many islands, ores, things to put in the sea, make fisheries, refine iron, and make weapons. Many of my grandfather's subordinates, as well as my uncles, are outside helping manage it."

"…"

Chu Xiaoye could not help but say, "Miss Doya, are you flaunting your wealth?"

Doya turned around and looked at him embarrassedly. "Lord Night, I'm just telling you the truth. I won't show off these things. I don't like these things."

Chu Xiaoye seemed to see a certain important figure in his previous life who was extremely wealthy. He would earn money every day like flowing water, but he would tell everyone without blushing or having his heart skip a beat that he did not love money.

"Then, Miss Doya, what do you like?"

Chu Xiaoye decided to find out the thoughts of those big shots from this girl.

Doya thought for a moment and said, "I like to lead the army and protect the country like Princess Carter. I like to ride horses, be unrestrained, and be free. I won't worry about business and money. I like to enjoy the blue sky, white sky, and green water alone on the green grassland."

Chu Xiaoye interrupted, "There are lions on the grassland that eat humans."

Doya smiled and said, "I'm not afraid. Don't I have you? Lord Night, you're a lion. You'll protect me, right?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and did not know how to answer.

Would he be in the grassland that this girl dreamed of?

Doya's beautiful hair fluttered as she looked into the distance, as if she was recalling something. After a while, she turned around and said softly, "Lord Night, I often dream that I will become a lion and live carefreely on the grassland. With the protection of the pride and the company of my friends, I won't be vexed by many things. I'll eat, sleep, and play. That life will definitely be interesting, right?"

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled and he looked at her in a daze.

Doya muttered, "I really want to become a lion and see such a life."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her with a complicated gaze and said, "Miss Doya, perhaps you were a cub in your previous life."

Doya smiled and said, "Lord Night, do you think we will have a previous life?"

"Yes."

Chu Xiaoye said with certainty.

He was a human in his previous life and a lion and an elf in this life, right?

"Alright, but if only I could be like Lord Night."

Doya said enviously.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her side face and said, "Miss Doya, who helped you name yourself?"

"Name?"

Doya looked at him in confusion and said, "I think it's Grandpa."

After saying that, she recalled carefully and said, "No, I think I named it myself. When I was young, Grandfather heard me mention this name and helped me set it down. I don't know where I heard this name."

Chu Xiaoye stared at her intently and said, "Every time Miss Doya dreams, is the lion you turned into also called Doya?"

Doya smiled and said, "Of course. My name is Doya. The lion I turned into is naturally called Doya."

"Then, did you have a nightmare? It was… When you turned into a lion, you suddenly encountered danger…"

Chu Xiaoye asked again.

Doya nodded and said, "Yes, there are many nightmares. One time, I remember I encountered a very big lion that bit my head off. Hehe."

Just as Chu Xiaoye was shocked, Lan Nixi, who was sitting behind him, suddenly said, "When Naliya was young, she often had such dreams. She once told me that she also dreamed that she had become a cub and lived on the grassland."
