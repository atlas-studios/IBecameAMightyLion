Chapter 513: Stupid Denise

The sun was bright.

After a night of nervous and excited fighting, the canyon was rarely quiet.

When Chu Xiaoye held the sword in his hand and tied the queen's red robe at his waist, walked to the open space on the hill and prepared to fight the giant sword loli again, his head immediately popped out from the rocks on both sides of the hill.

Then, the elves stood up and started jeering.

"Lady Vilis, all the best\! You must return the humiliation yesterday\!"

"Lord Night, all the best\! Yesterday, we all wanted to see you riding on Lady Vilis, but in the end, you only hugged her a little. You can't be soft-hearted today."

No one had any ill intentions and their thoughts were pure. They were just watching the fun.

"Clang\!"

Vilis raised her sword with a cold gaze. She was embarrassed and angry as she urged, "Attack\! Don't dawdle\!"

She was afraid that if she delayed for too long, this fellow would suddenly regret it. Then, the humiliation yesterday would never be washed away. Although he had actually spared her yesterday, as a noble knight and a Great Swordmaster of the elves, she would be even more ashamed and angry.

She did not want to be pitied by a bald smelly lion\!

"Night, don't be protective of the fairer sex and show mercy. Vilis is very powerful."

At this moment, Queen Lanisi walked over and cheered for Chu Xiaoye with a smile.

Vilis was a little wronged, but her fighting spirit was even higher. She smiled hypocritically and urged again loudly, "Come on\! Lord Night\! Please use all your strength. Don't be afraid that Lady Vilis can't handle it\!"

"Idiot\!"

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart. He held his sword with both hands and suddenly ran over. Then, he jumped up, raised the sword in his hand, and slashed down fiercely\!

The sharp blade whistled through the air with a cold aura, blowing up the two strands of silver hair that Vilis had draped over her chest.

Vilis' pupils constricted and she hurriedly blocked with her huge sword.

"Clang\!"

The two swords collided and sparks flew\!

Vilis immediately felt her arms go numb and her two legs tremble. Her knees almost bent.

She was shocked.

Why did this bastard's strength suddenly increase so much?

"This is the first sword move."

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and said. He immediately grabbed the sword hilt with both hands and swung it a second time.

Vilis' expression changed. She hurriedly took a step back and pressed her right foot tightly against the ground. She clenched her sword hilt tightly with both hands and gritted her teeth, using all her strength to prepare to block\!

"Clang\!"

With a crisp sound, the two swords only touched lightly.

Then, Chu Xiaoye quickly pulled out the sword in his hand next to hers. He suddenly swung it back from another direction and gathered the strength to slash again. Then, with a whoosh, he slashed towards the other side of her\!

Vilis was stunned at first, but her heart skipped a beat as she hurriedly swung her sword to block the other side.

As a great swordmaster with superb sword skills in the elves, her reaction speed could not be considered slow.

However, the direction she had just gathered strength to block was difficult to change at this moment.

"Clangâ€”"

A deafening buzz\!

The sword in Chu Xiaoye's hand slashed mercilessly at the sword of this giant sword fairy, sending her sword and her small and delicate body flying\!

Vilis' arm was numb and her mind was blank. After flying back a few meters, she fell heavily to the ground with a bang.

Before she could turn around and jump up, Chu Xiaoye had already followed closely and arrived in front of her. The sword in his hand was pressed against her throat. He looked at her with a smile and said, "Lady Vilis, this time, I followed your orders and did not pity you at all. I used all my strength. However, it seems that your small and cute body still can't withstand it."

This mockery made the already ashamed and sad little elf even more ashamed.

Her face was pale and her eyes were blank. She looked dejected. Even the sword that had never left her hand fell to the ground.

This scene stunned all the elves.

This young man did not know any sword skills at all, but his strength, speed, and schemes crushed this Great Swordmaster of the elves.

Their Lady Vilis actually lost and the other party only used three strikes.

Lanisi walked over and prepared to persuade the young man to give up the chance to humiliate this sister again.

She knew that Vilis was in a terrible mood.

A Great Sword Master was defeated by a young man who had just held a sword in succession in front of so many of his companions. How strong was his mentality to be able to withstand it?

However, before she could approach, the young man suddenly put away his sword, extended his hand, and said with a smile, "Lady Vilis, I was just joking with you. Get up, you did not lose. It's unfair to you to stand still and let me attack you three times. I'm a lion. My speed and strength are terrifying when I explode. If you stand still, you naturally can't resist. Now, it's your turn to retaliate."

The Queen stopped in place, her blue eyes flickering.

Denise stood not far away, still as a perfect sculpture.

Vilis looked at the young man in front of her in shock, his extended hand, and the sincere smile on his face. She was a little absent-minded in an instant.

She subconsciously raised her hand and grabbed his hand. He pulled her up, but she forgot to pick up the sword on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye bent down, helped her pick up the sword, and handed it to her. He smiled and said, "We agreed on ten strikes. As long as I can catch your ten strikes, you'll lose to me. Everyone's watching."

Vilis took the sword and looked at him with trembling eyes. She whispered, "You will lose miserably."

Chu Xiaoye smiled, held his sword, and took a few steps back. "Lady Vilis, that might not be true. You can use all your strength. Don't be afraid that Lord Night can't withstand it."

Vilis laughed and tears flowed from her eyes.

At this moment, this petite and delicate elf girl in a silver tight leather shirt and short skirt looked charming. The big fellow whose chest did not match her height and tender face was also heaving with her laughter.

"Lord Night, I really have to use my full strength."

Vilis wiped her tears and restrained her smile. She held the sword hilt with both hands and finally raised her chin slightly again, returning to her proud and noble demeanor as a Great Swordmaster.

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and said, "Come on\! Don't dawdle\!"

Vilis rushed up and suddenly turned around. The huge sword in her hand drew a circle with her and slashed horizontally.

This strength was greater and more ferocious\!

Chu Xiaoye naturally would not foolishly fight head-on. He immediately retreated again and dodged.

However, as long as this huge sword loli's sword moved, it would become faster and faster\!

The huge sword brought her body and chased after him like a whirlwind, leaving him nowhere to escape.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up from the ground and landed behind her.

He originally thought that this could make her sprint forward unable to retract her body for a moment. However, the little loli only used her foot to tap the ground and suddenly spun back, starting to chase and slash him again.

"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven\!"

As Chu Xiaoye retreated, he quickly counted and said loudly, "There are still three more strikes."

Vilis stopped spinning the storm and dragged her huge sword with both hands, charging at him.

Chu Xiaoye retreated to a rock and could not retreat. He raised the sword in his hand and took the initiative to slash.

This time, Vilis did not bite the bullet and block like before. Instead, she flashed gently and spun around, her skirt fluttering as she dodged. The silver hair that almost covered her entire petite body even flew to Chu Xiaoye's face and blocked his vision.

"Bang\!"

Vilis' huge sword cut his waist.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He looked down and realized that the sword in the little loli's hand had already been inserted into the sheath at some point in time\!

What cut his waist was a sword with a sheath.

"I hit you, Lord Night."

The little elf blinked and smiled. She had bright eyes and white teeth as she retreated and said, "There are still two more strikes. Take this strike as you blocking with your clothes. You haven't lost yet."

This was clearly going easy on him.

Chu Xiaoye threw the sword to the ground and said, "I'm not fighting anymore. I lost. I can't resist your sword technique."

The moment he threw the sword down, Vilis' expression immediately changed. She thought that he was angry and suddenly felt inexplicably uneasy and regretful. However, when she heard his words, could not help but laugh again, her heart filled with joy and pride.

She raised her chin slightly and curled her silver hair in front of her chest with her fingers. She said proudly, "Of course. If Lady Vilis gets serious, you, Lord Night, will naturally be able to resist her."

With that said, she snorted and laughed.

The frustration and pain from his previous two defeats seemed to have disappeared at this moment.

The giant sword elf seemed to be in a good mood.

"Hehe, don't be discouraged. As long as you don't provoke Lady Vilis again, she will teach you sword skills."

She bent down, picked up the sword on the ground, and handed it to him, smiling.

Denise walked over and handed over the scabbard.

After Chu Xiaoye pulled out his sword just now, he threw the sheath on the ground. He originally wanted to pick it up after the competition. He did not expect this quiet elf girl to take the initiative to pick it up for him and even handed it over very considerately.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in surprise, then took the sword and sheath and stuck the sword in.

At this moment, Lanisi walked over and looked at Alice with a smile. "Since Lady Vilis won, shouldn't Lady Vilis take the opportunity to wash away the humiliation last night? Why don't we let Night lie on the ground and let you ride him for a few rounds in front of everyone?"

With that said, she blinked again and deliberately said, "If this is the case, if Lady Vilis still hasn't vented her anger, then let Night become a lion and let you ride him a few more times. This way, you can definitely humiliate him and vent your anger. Lady Vilis, what do you think?"

An embarrassed expression appeared on Vilis' face. She looked up and saw that her companions on both sides of the hill were looking at her curiously. She hurriedly whispered, "Your Majesty, I didn't win. My sword was blocked by his clothes. Furthermore, in this bet, I only said that if I lost, I would let him ride me. I did not say what I would do if he lost."

The Queen pretended to be surprised and said, "Vilis, have you become soft-hearted?"

Vilis hurriedly explained, "Of course not\! I justâ€¦ I justâ€¦"

Her face was red and she was a little anxious. She suddenly said, "I'm a knight and a Great Swordmaster of the elves. I have to keep my promise. Since I didn't say what to do to him previously, I naturally can't go back on my word. Furthermoreâ€¦"

She lowered her head and whispered, "I really did not win."

Lanisi held back her laughter and said, "Alright, then, this competition will be considered a draw for you. No one won or lost."

Although everyone was a little dissatisfied with this outcome, they were happy to accept it. After all, these two were people they respected. It was not good for either side to be wronged.

At this moment, Princess Annie walked over and said, "The orcs built three bridges this time. They're very fast. Almost all the orcs on the other side have been mobilized. It looks like they're going all out to take revenge."

Everyone's expressions immediately turned grave.

If the three bridges came together, they would never be able to guard them. Even if a few more cars and crossbows came, it would probably be useless.

The orcs were betting everything and preparing to take revenge on them with their lives.

Everyone looked at the youth in unison again.

Chu Xiaoye could only say, "I knew last night. But it's okay. Let's wait here. Give up on the bridge and let them come in."

Vilis' lips moved as if she wanted to say something, but she did not speak in the end.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Lanisi and said, "Your Majesty, at that time, I'll have to trouble you. It might be a little dangerous."

Lanisi said with a determined gaze, "Night, just tell me. I'm the queen of the elves. I can face any danger. I'm willing to give up my life."

Annie frowned and said, "I can replace her."

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and looked at her. "You have to be a queen. The orcs should already know the queen's identity, and her red hair is more striking."

Annie fell silent.

Lanisi asked, "What should I do?"

Chu Xiaoye raised his hand and pointed at the entrance of the canyon. "Your Majesty needs to stand there with more than ten guards and wait for the orcs to cross the bridge."

"What about us?"

Vilis could not help but ask.

Chu Xiaoye said, "We'll hide on both sides of the hill and wait patiently."

The captain of the guards, the elven girl, Loli, who was standing behind the queen, immediately said, "How can this do? If the orcs cross the bridge, more than ten guards can't protect the queen at all\! Absolutely not\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the Queen and did not say anything.

Lanisi said with a burning gaze, "I will definitely complete the mission."

Chu Xiaoye nodded and looked around. "However, before that, I need to repeat myself. At that time, the Queen will be chased by the orc army with her guards. I hope that everyone will hide behind the rock and not expose themselves, let alone save the Queen. This time, it concerns your life and death, the survival of the entire elven race, and the survival and destruction of your Holy Land. I hope you all understand."

Lanisi suddenly raised her head, and her eyes seemed to be lit up with flames. She scanned the elves on both sides of the hill and said with a murderous tone, "Night's orders are my orders\! Whoever dares to disobey will be betrayed\!"

All the elves immediately lowered their heads and agreed in unison\!

"Your Majesty, and your fire dragon, I need its help. I can explain this to you in advance."

Chu Xiaoye leaned close to her and whispered.

This was very important. Whether they could wipe out the opposing orc army depended on the fire dragon.

Lanisi placed her ear close to his mouth and said softly, "Go on."

When the others beside him saw this, they took the initiative to make way.

Chu Xiaoye told her the plan and said, "We have to succeed. Otherwise, the battle might be won, but the orc army might also retreat safely. Furthermore, they will retreat with the news of new weapons like us. At that time, the next battle will be troublesome."

Lanisi said with a determined gaze, "Dolma will definitely succeed\!"

Her sharp white ears suddenly accidentally touched Chu Xiaoye's lips, causing her heart to tremble. However, her expression was normal as she slowly moved away.

Chu Xiaoye stared at her ear and raised his hand to touch his ear. He could not help but say, "Your Majesty, are my ears as beautiful as yours?"

To be honest, ever since he became an elf, he had never seriously looked at the mirror or his ears.

The Queen smiled and said, "Of course. Your ears might be more beautiful."

Chu Xiaoye gathered his courage and begged, "Your Majesty, let me touch your ear. I want to see if the feeling of your ear is the same as mine."

The Queen was stunned for a moment, but she did not reject. She took the initiative to turn her beautiful face and lean her ear over. She smiled and said, "Touch it. It's just an ear. How can it feel?"

Chu Xiaoye could not help but think to himself, Could it be that the Queen is hinting to me that there is actually something that feels better to touch than an ear on her?

"Eh, the feeling is indeed different."

He pinched the queen's fair and tender ears and said in surprise, "Your Majesty's ears are even softer and more tender."

When his fingers pinched the Queen's ear, the Queen's heart started to tremble again. Unexpectedly, after he pinched it in his hand, he rubbed and pulled, causing the Queen's ear to be itchy and her heart to itch non-stop. She could not help but blush.

The Queen was not a shy girl and had been natural and unrestrained since young. However, she could not tolerate such intimate contact and teasing.

She was only a young girl who had just turned 17\.

"Bastard\! Let go\!"

Vilis turned around and saw this impudent scene. She was stunned at first, then shocked and furious. She immediately shouted.

Chu Xiaoye immediately let go and said angrily, "I didn't pinch you. Why are you so anxious?"

At this moment, the others also turned around, but they had blank expressions and did not know what was happening.

Vilis hurriedly complained to Princess Annie, "That bastard, heâ€¦ He was pinching the queen'sâ€¦ queen'sâ€¦"

Annie looked at the Queen's chest in shock.

Lanisi hurriedly said, "Vilis, don't be so loud. He's just pinching my ear. Night has just become an elf and is a little curious, so I let him pinch it. It's nothing."

Annie heaved a sigh of relief.

No matter how broad-minded her sister was, how respectful she was to the wise, and how natural she was, she could not wrong herself in public.

"Hmph\! Bastard\!"

Vilis looked at someone sideways and was still very angry.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and left with Catherine with his sword.

He needed to patrol the two sides of the hill to check the arrangements of the fire oil and the hiding places of the elven archers.

Denise carried the ice-blue jade bow and followed behind them silently.

She seemed to have suddenly become his shadow like Catherine. She was silent but was inseparable.

However, her tall figure gave Chu Xiaoye a lot of pressure.

Shorties would try their best to avoid standing further away from tall people, lest they looked shorter. The handsome ones would also try their best to avoid standing with the more handsome ones, lest the original red flower become a green leaf that served as a contrast.

Denise's height, fairy-like appearance, and stunning aura really threatened him.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but look back at her and say, "Denise, did Her Majesty ask you to follow me and protect me?"

Denise did not answer.

If it was not a very necessary question, she would not answer.

She was used to silence.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and turned around to look at her. "Denise, I order you to speak."

Denise nodded slightly and said, "Yes."

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "I don't need protection. Furthermore, you saw that Catherine is already behind me. Denise, you should protect the Queen. The Queen is in danger in this battle. Do you know?"

Denise was silent.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and continued forward.

However, when he turned around, he realized that this stubborn silver-haired girl was still following behind him.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but say, "Alright, Denise, let me tell you the truth. I don't really like you following me. I'm a man and don't need a woman to protect me. Furthermore, I can transform at any time and then return. In other words, I'll be naked at any time. Are you sure that you won't find it unbearable to watch?"

Denise was silent for a moment before saying, "No."

Her gaze was clear and her expression was calm, as if she was not lying.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and looked at her in surprise, feeling a little choked.

"But I will. I'll be embarrassed."

Chu Xiaoye complained.

Denise lowered her head and said softly, "You can treat me as air."

Chu Xiaoye:"â€¦"

"Alright, you win."

Chu Xiaoye stopped harping on this matter and said, "Have you and your archers ever shot arrows with flames? How's their aim?"

Denise seemed to not understand and a confused expression appeared on her beautiful face.

An arrow with flames?

Why was the arrowhead covered in flames?

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. Oh no, he had almost forgotten the most important thing\!

These pure elves had never lit flames on the arrowhead\!

"Hurry\!"

Chu Xiaoye was anxious and hurriedly said to her, "Denise, call all the archers over immediately. I'll show you how to shoot."

Denise was shocked. She finally could not help but ask, "You know how to shoot arrows too?"

Chu Xiaoye said angrily, "Cut the crap\! Go quickly\!"

Denise was stunned for a moment before she immediately left.

Did she have a lot of nonsense to say?

She rarely spoke anyway.

However, could Lord Night really shoot arrows?

Even if he did, why was he so confident that he would demonstrate it to them personally?

The elven girl left in a hurry with questions.

"Idiot\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her tall back with her silver hair dancing and could not help but complain.
