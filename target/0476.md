Chapter 476: Turtle in a jar

The enemy was here\!

With anger, killing intent, and the pleasure of having hatred erupt for a long time\!

They were all familiar faces and neighbors.

Back then, Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and beat them until they were obedient. They obediently admitted who owned this territory and promised not to invade.

Now, it seemed that they had always been unwilling.

The foreign pride actually divided their territory under their noses and even brazenly took away many territories that originally belonged to them. How could they be willing?

The young golden-haired lion king used his powerful strength to make them lower their arrogant heads and have no choice but to accept the reality of their territory being snatched.

This was their humiliation.

They always remembered and never forgot.

Soon, the opportunity came.

The young and powerful lion king suddenly disappeared and never appeared at the borders of the territory again.

The scouts they sent out quietly sneaked into this territory and did not see the other party's figure.

Even when this pride went out to hunt or encountered the covetous and challenge of a foreign lion, the young lion king did not appear.

They even deliberately sent out a group of wandering lions to pretend to invade this territory. It was still the young lion with a long tail fighting the pride. As for the powerful lion king with a golden mane, it was still nowhere to be seen.

They thought of a possibility. The other party might be dead or had already left.

They immediately became excited and the flames of hatred in their hearts started to burn.

However, they were still a little hesitant.

Until the famous and terrifying king of killers suddenly appeared.

Hence, their confidence soared. The four prides immediately worked together. Under the lead of the king of killers, they walked over the border valiantly and aggressively, charging towards the nest of this pride with a murderous aura.

Indeed, there was no more resistance on the way. This pride had already cowered in the cave and was trembling. They did not even have the courage to go out and fight.

Without the lion king, how could the pride fight them?

Today was the death of this pride\!

The four prides, be it the lion or the lionesses, were all mobilized. They wanted to kill this newly arrived pride and eliminate them at the root\!

The king of killers, who was also terrifying in size and strength, disappeared after slapping the one-eyed lion away.

However, it was okay. Now was the time for them to show off.

Four strong lion kings brought their respective prides and came aggressively under the super huge tree.

They clearly smelled the scent of those cowards and saw the terrified appearances of those cowards hiding in the caves at the bottom of the tree, baring their fangs and struggling before death.

"You all have such a day\!"

The four prides gathered into a torrent and roared as they rushed towards the first hole.

However, the entrance was not wide. A lion with mixed fur guarded there, and he alone blocked the entrance.

He bared his fangs and swung his claws. Seeing so many ferocious faces pounce on him, he did not retreat.

Sharp claws clashed and fangs bit each other as they roared endlessly\!

Soon, many wounds appeared on the mixed fur's claws and face, dripping with blood.

Little Curly Tail suddenly roared from behind him and told him to pull back a little.

Mixed Fur started to retreat and retracted his head and claws into the cave, but he did not retreat too far. This way, Little Curly Tail could stand beside him in battle.

There were many enemies outside and countless of them. However, if they wanted to enter through this hole, they could only enter one by one. This would be easy.

With two lions as the barrier, ten thousand lions could not open it\!

The lions gathered outside the cave roaring seemed to have realized this problem. After Mixed Fur retreated to the cave, they suddenly stopped there. No one dared to be the first to enter. If they were not careful, their heads would be separated.

They started to roar anxiously and angrily.

Soon, the other lions following behind discovered the other two holes.

Hence, they ran there again\!

However, the other two holes were also guarded by ferocious beasts.

The second hole had the largest space. That was where the huge saber-toothed tiger crawled in.

The pride came with hope, but they still stopped outside the cave.

The ones guarding the entrance were the cute violent bear mother and son pair and the strong Jerry brothers.

They stood side by side and blocked the way.

The cute violent bear and her son looked charmingly naive, but after showing their fangs, they became ferocious. Their huge and heavy claws could not be underestimated.

The Jerry brothers, who had the blood of the snow mountain white lion, looked even more troublesome.

They occupied a favorable terrain. Once anyone rushed in, they would charge forward.

Who could not be afraid of death?

Hence, the flustered and exasperated lions ran towards the third hole.

The third hole was narrower. The male leopard and female leopard guarded at the front, looking rather calm.

Although they were quietly guarding there and did not show their fangs and claws, nor did they let out threatening roars, no one doubted the hunting skills of these two leopards\!

Once one of the prides stuck its head in, it would definitely be a tragedy of having its fangs locked\!

No one dared to underestimate the leopard's throat-locking and speed\!

The pride outside the cave lingered and hesitated. They were shocked, angry, anxious, and hateful, but they did not know what to do.

Just as they were about to catch this pride that had lost its lion king, they were suddenly stopped outside and could not advance or retreat. Who could not be anxious?

The lion was roaring, the lionesses were running around, and the team was in chaos.

"Roarâ€”"

However, their lion kings were not ordinary.

The lion kings of the four prides quickly calmed their teams and formulated a plan. They split up and guarded the three holes, waiting patiently outside the hole.

They were not in a hurry to enter.

They could always wait outside.

However, the cowards hiding inside could not hide inside forever.

Hunger and thirst, imprisonment and fear would replace them and rush in. They would enter the bodies of those cowards everywhere and eat their bodies and minds bit by bit.

In a few days, those cowards would lose without a fight.

They either killed each other, ate the other party, took the initiative to surrender, beg for mercy, or rushed out to die without care.

No matter what, these cowards had to die\!

Victory would ultimately belong to them\!

The four prides split into three groups and surrounded the three holes.

The lions guarded the place, and the lionesses went out to hunt. They divided the work and could even sleep, play, and mate.

The cowards hiding in the cave could only watch pitifully, tolerate the darkness and thirst, tolerate the fear of not having freedom, and slowly wait for death inside.

This was the outcome of angering them\!

In the cave at the bottom of the tree, Little Curly Tail and the others quickly understood the scheme of the pride.

However, what could they do?

Their pride was still weak and could not resist this super pride that had teamed up.

Furthermore, there was an even more terrifying killer lurking outside, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

They had just eaten yesterday and were not hungry yet. However, if this continued, how many days could they last?

As each day passed, they would become weaker and weaker. At that time, how could they have the strength to guard the entrance and fight the enemy?

Everyone seemed to have realized this problem.

They started to panic.

Then, they raised their heads in unison and looked up.

In the past, as long as their king was here, any problem could be resolved easily. No problem was a problem. They did not need to worry or be afraid.

But now?

"Roarâ€”"

An angry roar came from the cold father.

This former lion king finally could not tolerate it anymore. It looked up and roared angrily.

"Unfilial son\! Coward\! Did you die hiding inside?"

However, there was still no reaction from above.

Even Catherine, who was guarding the entrance, still had a cold expression and did not even look at him.
