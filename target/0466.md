Chapter 466: Claw Ray\!

An enemy was attacking\!

The roars of the Jerry brothers clearly revealed their current emotions and their roughroughly strength.

The enemy was very strong\!

Chu Xiaoye did not rashly bring all the members of the pride out to welcome the enemy. He only brought Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the cold father, Little Curly Tail, and the others. The other members stayed in the camp and waited for his orders.

Although things were different now, to lions or other species, battles were still something between males.

This was their responsibility and honor.

Of course, it was their responsibility to pee like the Chino brothers. It was better to stay in the camp and accumulate urine obediently.

Catherine followed behind Chu Xiaoye like she always did and stayed close to him. She was as stubborn as a teenage girl.

Alisa naturally followed. As she walked, she always deliberately stuck out her head faster than him, looking like she was the leader of this pride.

The deep lesson last night did not make her depressed or her dreams start to sway. Instead, it made her more determined and aroused the courage and desire in her heart.

Only by becoming a true king could she take revenge\!

After leaving the bushes, the figures of the Jerry brothers appeared in their vision. At the same time, the figures of the enemy could be seen.

It was a group of lions, a total of fifteen lions. They were all tall and fierce, and they were not inferior to the Jerry brothers\!

The leading lion was a mighty lion with a black mane and was in its prime.

They lined up and were only ten meters away from the Jerry brothers, but they were not in a hurry to sprint. Instead, they paced and walked over slowly, as if they were taking a leisurely stroll in their territory.

To Chu Xiaoye's pride, they were a group of invaders\!

Regardless of whether they had once lived here, this place had already become the new territory of Chu Xiaoye's pride. Whoever dared to trespass was invading\!

For invaders, there were usually only three outcomes.

The first was to die tragically in defeat, the second was to escape in defeat, and the third would be to win and change dynasties to ascend the throne.

However, today, Chu Xiaoye decided to give them a fourth outcome—surrender\!

The two sides sized each other up and walked closer and closer.

The battle was about to start.

However, these fifteen invaders were clearly not in a hurry to attack, as if they were waiting for something.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt that something was wrong.

At this moment, the cold father could not tolerate it anymore. He immediately roared and issued the order to attack.

As for Alisa, she was even more direct. She rushed up first with a whoosh.

Facing these fifteen ferocious lions that were almost twice her size, this young lioness was not afraid at all. Instead, her eyes were filled with anger, as if she was venting something.

She jumped behind the fifteen lions and swung her sharp claws, preparing to attack their crotches.

"I'll let you wash away the humiliation last night with your blood today\!"

If these fifteen lions heard the shout in her heart, they would definitely be very puzzled. They did not do anything last night, Why?

Fortunately, they were not ordinary lions. When Alisa jumped over their heads, two lions turned around and pounced at her.

The battle had already started\!

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to think and immediately rushed up with the team.

These fifteen lions were very strong, but to him, they were still very weak. After a few rounds, two lions were sent flying and could not stand up again.

Even the black-haired lion leader did not last three rounds under him.

Chu Xiaoye was even more puzzled.

Such a team would naturally be invincible in other grasslands and win every battle. But here, they were really a little weak. The strength of the leader should at least light up a crystal whisker. Otherwise, it would be difficult to survive here.

After Chu Xiaoye slapped the black-haired lion leader unconscious, he did not continue attacking. Instead, he subconsciously turned around and looked at the bushes not far behind him.

Just as he was feeling bewildered, Chino's terrified roar suddenly came from under the super huge tree in the bushes\!

Then, Mei Mei's roar and the roars of the other members of the pride sounded together\!

"We've fallen into a trap\!"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly roared angrily and turned to run back. With a puff, he sprayed out a stream of air and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Catherine, who was opening the lions' stomachs, immediately turned around and chased after them.

Chu Xiaoye was very fast\!

However, the attacker was also very fast\!

When Chu Xiaoye rushed back under the super huge tree at his fastest speed, he saw the corpses of the Chino brothers lying bloodily at the entrance of the underground cave. Their two heads were blurry and their bones were broken, almost turning into a lump of paste\!

The two brothers stood guard outside the cave. When they discovered the enemy, they only had time to roar before their heads were smashed and they died\!

They did not even have the time to return to the cave at the bottom of the tree\!

Chu Xiaoye was terrified. He did not have the time to be angry and sad for them. With a whoosh, he rushed into the underground cave.

A huge and fierce figure appeared in the cave and slapped the Jiela sisters away, biting the body of a female lion into two. The fierce and powerful figure could not be stopped\!

Saber-toothed tiger\!

The ancient ferocious beast that he had played with\!

This ferocious beast actually brought the pride to take revenge and let the fifteen lions lure them out. Then, it came here alone and started a massacre\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and pounced forward with red eyes\!

The Chino brothers were dead, the Jiela sisters and their sisters were dead, and Mei Mei and Molly were lying on the ground. No one knew if they were dead or alive. His mother, Xi'er, and Maya were protecting the two young cubs, trembling. The big black bear was also lying on the ground with its head covered in blood. The little girl was pressed down and struggling with all her might.

This fierce ancient ferocious beast was preparing to kill his pride\!

The anger in his chest was like flames burning. The heat in his body was like a wave surging. Chu Xiaoye's body seemed to be melting. The golden mane on his neck suddenly lit up with a whoosh\!

Chu Xiaoye's claws actually lit up with a few golden claws. Although they were as weak as stars, they carried an incomparably sharp and unstoppable cold light\!

"Whoosh\!"

The sharp golden claws collided fiercely with the saber-toothed tiger's huge claws, but there was no collision\!

Blood flew out\!

Half of the saber-toothed tiger's huge claws actually flew out\!

"Roar\!"

A deafening miserable scream suddenly sounded in the cave at the bottom of the tree, causing the cave at the bottom of the tree to rumble\!

Chu Xiaoye landed and flew up again\!
