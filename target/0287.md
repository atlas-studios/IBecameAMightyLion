Chapter 287: Although the Lion King is Old

"Whoosh\!"

A silver light suddenly lit up in the night\!

When the black lion leader walked to the middle of the bushes, a figure suddenly jumped down from a big tree beside him and shot towards him at lightning speed\!

Catherine's silver claws flickered with a cold light in the night, like two curved blades made of refined iron. With a whoosh, she slashed at the head of the black lion leader\!

But.

Before her claws could land, a black lion beside the black lion leader suddenly jumped up and sent her flying with a bang\!

Catherine fell to the ground in a sorry state. Before the other black lions could surround her, she immediately jumped up and climbed up another tree at the side.

The black lion leader did not look at her and continued forward.

He had just taken a few steps when a long tail suddenly jumped out from the grass beside him. With a whoosh, it swept over\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The few black lions were caught off guard and were immediately swept to the ground.

As for the black lion leader and the four experts behind him, they nimbly jumped up.

One of the black lion guards jumped into the bushes with a whoosh and pounced at Little Curly Tail, who was hiding inside.

"Whoosh\!"

Unexpectedly, just as he entered the bushes, the iron tail slapped him\!

"Bam\!"

It hit his nose\!

The black lion guard was sent flying. His nose was broken and his face was covered in blood\!

"Roar—"

He was furious and immediately jumped up from the ground, pouncing on the dense bushes again.

This time, he opened his mouth and bared his fangs. As long as the tail dared to come over again, he would definitely bite it off\!

"Bang\!"

However, just as he rushed into the bushes and was about to bite, the iron tail suddenly whipped over and slapped his two front legs heavily, causing him to kneel on the ground.

At the same time, the iron tail quickly turned in midair and whipped back again. With a bang, it hit his open mouth\!

Blood splashed out and two fangs flew out.

Before the black lion guard could close his mouth, the iron tail had already been pulled out.

"Roar—"

The other black lion guard roared angrily and rushed over to help.

Little Curly Tail immediately jumped out of the bushes and fled into the distance.

The two black guards roared and chased after him.

The black lion leader did not stop and continued forward with the other two black lion guards.

In front, the black lion army had already rushed out of the bushes and chased towards the grassland.

"Whoosh—"

Molly suddenly jumped down from the tree and pounced at one of the black lion guards.

The black lion guard reacted extremely quickly. He swung his claws and sent her flying with a bang.

Molly fell to the ground in a sorry state and immediately jumped up. She staggered and fled in another direction.

Seeing that she was seriously injured, the black lion guard hesitated for a moment and immediately chased after her, preparing to kill her.

There was only one guard left beside the black lion leader.

At this moment, Mei Mei suddenly jumped down from the tree and rushed towards the black lion leader.

The black lion leader was roaring and giving orders to the pride in front of him. He ignored her and jumped, dodging her attack and continuing to walk quickly.

The remaining black lion guard rushed towards Mei Mei.

When the black lion leader was about to walk out of the bushes, a golden light suddenly flashed above his head with a whoosh and slashed at his head.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree. Just as he was about to succeed, the black lion leader suddenly flashed and disappeared from the spot.

When his golden claw missed and his body landed on the ground, a strong wind suddenly came from behind. With a bang, before he could react, he was sent flying\!

The black lion leader appeared behind him like a ghost. After slapping him away, he chased after him like a ghost. Before he could land, he slapped him again on the head\!

"Bang\!"

In his panic, Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and received the slap.

He flew out again and fell heavily to the ground.

His head was buzzing and his feet were in pain, trembling slightly.

He did not dare to hesitate and immediately pulled himself together and jumped up.

Unexpectedly, just as he jumped up, the black lion leader rushed over again. Its speed was like a ghost, and it was indescribably fast. It arrived almost in the blink of an eye\!

"Bang\!"

Before Chu Xiaoye could raise his claws to face it, the black lion leader's claws slapped him heavily on the head again.

Chu Xiaoye was like a ball that had been slapped and flew out. His head was dripping with blood and a few pieces of flesh and fur were scratched off by the sharp claws.

He fell to the ground in a sorry state and immediately felt his vision turn black. The entire world was shaking.

If it were an ordinary lion, its skull would have been crushed and it would have died completely after suffering this slap. His body and bones had long been modified and mutated countless times. They were extremely strong, but it was still difficult to withstand this terrifying strength.

The strength of this black lion leader was terrifyingly strong\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up and vaguely saw two crystal whiskers light up at the corner of the black lion leader's mouth. No, only half of one of them lit up.

One and a half sticks.

The black lion leader walked in front of him and looked down at him coldly and mockingly, as if he was mocking his incompetence or his scheme.

He thought that he could kill this black lion leader by letting his companions go out and lure away the four black lion guards. However, he did not expect that the other party had actually seen through his plan and was deliberately waiting for him.

Obviously, this black lion leader had long known that he was the true king of this team.

Chu Xiaoye struggled with all his might, wanting to get up from the ground, but he felt a sharp pain in his head. The scene in front of him swayed and he could not stand up at all.

In his body, the strange heat was flowing quickly to his head to heal him.

However, this black lion leader would not give him any chance\!

"Whoosh\!"

The black lion leader's huge claws were like a black cloud that enveloped his head, blocking his eyes and vision.

Everything was dark.

"Roar—"

In the distance, by the river near the forest, the lion's roar did not weaken. Instead, it became stronger\!

The team that originally only had more than ten old lions suddenly expanded to nearly 100\!

The twenty-over black female lions that had come against the water and were preparing to attack actually fell into a pool of blood and could not stand up again.

As for this group of old lions, their fighting spirit was still high and their blood was not cold\!

Under the lead of the cold father, they roared as they charged towards the black lion army with a murderous aura\!

Lars, One-eyed, and the other lions, who had already retreated to the edge of the grassland with their teams, were stunned when they saw this scene.

Among this group of old lions, some had their fangs broken, some were already disabled, some were still hungry, and some had just been chased out of the pride. However, at this moment, they charged towards the pursuing black lion army without hesitation to fight for the female lions, young cubs, and their companions behind them\!

Although a lion was old, he was still brave\!

"Roar—"

Their manes fluttered as they roared in unison, vowing to bloom with the final light of the lion king\!

They had once been dazzling and were dusk now. However, the blood of lions still flowed in their bodies and they still had to release the last bit of light\!
