Chapter 454: Tiger Race

The sky turned dark very quickly.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Alisa and looked in the direction where Little Curly Tail and the others had left.

The scent of Little Curly Tail and the others still lingered in the bushes. Chu Xiaoye followed them all the way out of the bushes and came to the boundless grassland.

The lush grass swayed in the cool night wind.

The silver moon was like a plate in the night sky, shining with starlight.

In the distant darkness, a few pairs of green eyes were looking at them.

However, when they approached, they walked far away.

Chu Xiaoye followed the scent left behind by Little Curly Tail and headed north. When he passed by a swamp, he suddenly smelled blood. At the same time, a few dark eyes popped out from the dense grass.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately passed through the grass and walked over.

They were three jackals and seemed to be a family of three. They were eating a water buffalo that had long died on the ground.

There was only half of the water buffalo's body left. With the jackal's appetite, it definitely could not eat so much meat. And here, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly's scent happened to linger.

It was very possible that this strong water buffalo was killed by Little Curly Tail and the other two.

Then, where did they go?

Chu Xiaoye walked towards the water buffalo's corpse, wanting to check the marks left behind by Little Curly Tail and the others.

The three jackals had long discovered them, but they looked hungry and did not escape immediately. They were looking at them nervously as they seized the time to bite the flesh on the ground, looking like they were preparing to escape at any time.

When Chu Xiaoye and the other two walked close, the three jackals finally felt fear and immediately turned to escape.

However, they did not leave. Instead, they stopped not far away and waited uneasily.

Chu Xiaoye sniffed around the water buffalo and did not stay. He immediately brought Catherine and Alisa forward.

After they left, the three jackals immediately ran over and continued to wolf down the food.

However, in less than a moment, there were three more jackals' corpses here.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly smelled a familiar scent of blood\!

He hurriedly quickened his steps and walked forward. He discovered a few drops of blood on the grass in front of him. At the same time, he smelled the scent Mei Mei left behind.

Mei Mei was injured\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart tightened and he immediately ran forward.

Little Curly Tail and the other two seemed to be being chased by a group of ferocious beasts and looked injured\!

"Roar\!"

Right at this moment, a roar suddenly came from a patch of bushes in front of him\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. It was the roar of a tiger\!

"Whoosh\!"

He immediately jumped up and shot towards the bushes.

Catherine and Alisa also followed closely like lightning\!

In the bushes.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly were trapped on a big tree, their bodies covered in blood.

Under the tree, there were five tigers looking up at them covetously\!

These five tigers were tall, strong, and fierce. Every one of them was very strong, and their movements were agile, their intelligence was extraordinary, and they were very united.

For some reason, the five tigers hated Little Curly Tail and the other two. They chased after them from noon to night, looking like they wanted to kill them and tear them into pieces.

In the beginning, Little Curly Tail was not afraid and even wanted to challenge it excitedly. Unexpectedly, after a few rounds, not only was he injured, Mei Mei and Molly were also injured. Molly was almost cut open by one of the tigers and was seriously injured.

Fortunately, there was a forest here with many trees, and they were not too thick.

Although tigers knew how to climb trees, these five tigers were too big and their bodies were too heavy. They only dared to climb around the waist of the tree roots and did not dare to climb up high. That was why this situation had happened.

Little Curly Tail and the other two waited solemnly on the tree, while the five tigers roared and threatened under the tree, waiting patiently.

Molly was the most injured. Blood flowed endlessly from her body and she was about to faint.

Mei Mei had been licking her wounds with her tongue, hoping to use her saliva to disinfect and stop the blood like her brother did, but the effect was very bad.

Mei Mei was also injured. There were a few deep wounds on her back that could be seen. Fortunately, she did not bleed again.

Little Curly Tail looked at Molly's bloodstained body and secretly regretted his rashness. When he first discovered the five tigers, if they immediately turned around and fled, they could definitely escape.

Now, because of his rashness and recklessness, the three of them had fallen into this dangerous situation.

From the first tiger he encountered on the former grassland, he had lingering fear of this powerful animal. Now, he thought that he had become stronger and could defeat the other party easily. Unexpectedly, he was only arrogant.

If something happened to Mei Mei, how could he explain it to his brother?

At this moment, facing the enemy, Little Curly Tail, who had never been afraid, his heart was filled with anxiety and regret.

The five tigers surrounded the tree and kept walking and roaring. They climbed tentatively, wanting them to be highly focused and ready to fight at all times. They could not rest.

Seeing that Molly was becoming more and more dispirited and almost had no strength to lie on the tree, Little Curly Tail was anxious and uneasy. He immediately made up his mind and roared angrily, preparing to jump down and fight the five tigers to the death.

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out from the dark bushes. Golden light flashed and it slashed at one of the tigers\! 

The tiger reacted quickly. It immediately swung its tail and quickly jumped to the side\!

However, the tail that was extremely important to it in battle suddenly turned cold and blood splashed everywhere. It was actually cut off from the middle\!

"Roar\!"

The ferocious tiger with a broken tail roared angrily\!

The other four ferocious tigers were shocked. They jumped away from the spot and looked over angrily.

The figure landed on the ground and was actually a young lion with a golden mane\!

"Brother\! It's Brother\! Brother is here to save us\!"

Mei Mei was the first to see it clearly and immediately stood up excitedly.

As long as her brother came, Molly would be saved and so would they. Ever since she was young, her confidence in her brother had never changed.

The fear in Little Curly Tail's heart immediately turned into excitement and courage\!

"Roarâ€”"

He roared and jumped down from the tree, standing beside his brother. His previously dejected eyes instantly lit up with fighting spirit\!

As long as he stood with his brother, he was not afraid\!

Any enemy who dared to stop him and his brother would be torn to pieces and turned to dust\!

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and the blood in his chest surged. He felt that his entire body was suddenly filled with strength and the tail behind him actually became a little hot.

The ferocious tiger with a broken tail seemed to be a little flustered and exasperated. Before its companions could respond, it pounced forward alone. Its huge tiger claw was like a hammer that brought with it a strong wind as it slapped Chu Xiaoye heavily\!

When the other four ferocious tigers saw this, they immediately roared angrily and pounced over.
