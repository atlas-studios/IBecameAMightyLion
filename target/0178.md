Chapter 178: The dignity of a King

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye got up, raised his hind leg, and kicked the little white lion's head, causing her to roll back. With a splash, she fell into the river.

Before the two rhinoceroses that were like small mountains rushed over, Chu Xiaoye quickly fled this place.

In the river.

He had already cut open the abdomen of the crocodile. It would definitely attract more crocodiles.

If the little white lion could not get up immediately, it could only die in the stomach of the crocodile.

She asked for it\!

Don't think that you can do whatever you want just because you're white\!

He, Chu Xiaoye, did not fall for this trick\!

The forest was extremely lively.

All sorts of carnivores came after hearing the news and wolfed down the pride's corpses that they had never dared to imagine.

Chu Xiaoye found a tall Baobab tree and gently climbed up. He hid in the lush leaves to sleep.

Although the strange heat in his body made his injuries heal very quickly, the energy and stamina he expended still needed to be replenished with sleep.

The leaves blocked the sun.

He soon closed his eyes and fell asleep.

After sleeping for an unknown period of time, the roars of the Chino brothers suddenly sounded in his ears, seemingly filled with fear.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly woke up and raised his head to look at the grassland outside.

He thought that an enemy had invaded or that the blue-eyed lion king was attacking again. Unexpectedly, it was the two strong rhinoceroses that were running ferociously after the Chino brothers\!

The Chino brothers were shocked and furious. They did not know how they had provoked them at all. Wasn't it just raising their hind legs in front of them to pee\!

When they ran into the bushes in panic, the two rhinoceroses finally stopped chasing and turned to leave.

Chu Xiaoye saw that the little white lion was not beside them. Just as he thought that the little white lion had died in the river, he suddenly heard a warm breath.

"Roar—"

Before he could turn around, a sharp and ear-piercing roar suddenly exploded in his ears\!

Chu Xiaoye almost peed his pants\!

Just as he was about to jump up, a claw slapped him hard on the head with a bang and pulled him down from the branch\!

"Chi\!"

On the way to land, Chu Xiaoye waved his claws and grabbed the branch below. He suddenly jumped and landed steadily on the branch.

At this moment, he saw that the enemy who suddenly attacked was the little white lion\!

The little white lion glared at him provocatively and jumped up. It actually jumped more than ten meters away and landed on a big tree in the distance. It turned its head and looked at him proudly.

She seemed to be saying, "Kid, do you dare to chase me?"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. This female cub was actually so strong\!

However, he did not hesitate.

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly jumped up and flew over like a bird spreading its wings to fly, landing on the big tree\!

Now that he had claws, his strength had increased a lot. His jumping distance was naturally much greater than before.

When he was in the pride of the cold father, he often practised jumping between the trees in the bushes at the back. Now, there were more trees here, and it was naturally easier to jump.

Just as he was about to land on the branch the little white lion was standing on, the little white lion's eyes flashed. It immediately ran a few steps and jumped up again\!

This time, she did not land on a branch directly. Instead, she landed on a thick tree trunk. With a bang, she straightened her body and climbed steadily there\!

She turned her head and continued to look provocatively at Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye sneered in his heart and immediately ran a few steps forward and jumped out\!

To his current golden claw, this action was a piece of cake. It was not a challenge at all\!

"Bam\!"

He landed steadily on the tree trunk, and his sharp claws easily pierced through the bark and grabbed it.

Furthermore, his butt happened to be aimed at the little white lion's head. He swung his tail and slapped the little white lion's face\!

"Roar—"

The little white lion opened its mouth and bit\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up again and landed on a big tree in the distance. He suddenly jumped out again and jumped quickly through the forest like an agile monkey.

A group of monkeys were eating fruits on branches in the orchard. Seeing him jumping around on the branches, they quickly jumped over, thinking that he was a species that had trespassed their territory.

Just as they were baring their sharp teeth and preparing to scream and chase Chu Xiaoye away, they suddenly realized that this fellow who was jumping faster and more agile than them was actually a lion\!

The monkeys immediately froze on the branches, not knowing what to do.

Just as they were hesitating about whether to escape, Chu Xiaoye had already quickly jumped in front of them, as if he did not see them at all.

When Chu Xiaoye jumped out of the orchard and landed on the crown of a small tree, shaking it around like a barb, he turned around and looked behind him, laughing coldly in his heart.

The little white lion could no longer be seen.

Obviously, he had already left them far behind.

To compare jumping with him was simply showing off in front of an expert and overestimating his capabilities\!

"Bang\!"

Right at this moment, something suddenly fell from the sky and hit his head. Then, it fell into the grass.

It was actually a green fruit\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately looked up. On a big tree beside him, the little white lion was crawling on the tree trunk, grinning at him as if it was mocking him.

Not only did she catch up to him, but she also picked a fruit from the orchard just now.

It was obvious who would win and who would lose\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her in a daze, feeling a little incredulous.

His speed was already extremely terrifying, and he had been practising since he was young and had never fallen behind. Now, with these invincible golden claws and the support of powerful strength, she still caught up to him\!

This little white lion was even more perverted than him\!

"What, are you convinced?"

The little white lion grinned at him, its eyes filled with pride.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment, and his eyes flashed. He immediately swayed his body and quickly swayed on the canopy of this small tree. Then, he raised his head and looked at her provocatively.

He seemed to be saying, "Girl, do you dare to swing it?"

"Whoosh\!"

The little white lion did not hesitate and jumped down. Its proud gaze was filled with disdain, as if it was saying, "Why not? Kid, watch carefully\!"

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, just as she landed, before she could grab it steadily, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and slapped her head, sending her flying\!

Then, Chu Xiaoye jumped down\!

The little white lion had just fallen to the ground and had yet to stand up when Chu Xiaoye fell from the sky with a bang and rode on her. He waved his claws quickly and started slapping her head mercilessly\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Little thing\! How dare you behave atrociously in my territory\! How dare you not give me face\! You dare to jump faster than me\! You're asking for a beating\!

The dignity of a king could not be violated\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

After Chu Xiaoye slapped her more than ten times, he immediately jumped up and quickly fled the place.

He could not let a third party know about this, or else the might of the lion king that he had painstakingly built up would be ruined\!

He had just run a few steps when he saw the Chino brothers standing in the grass in front of him, panting and looking at him with their eyes wide.

On a big tree at the side, the leopard family was also lying on it, looking at him blankly.

At the same time.

In the forest under the distant mountain range, the cute mother and son pair were fishing in the pool under the waterfall.

A dirty female cub walked down the mountain covered in dust and looked coldly and covetously at the cute cub.

She was hungry.
