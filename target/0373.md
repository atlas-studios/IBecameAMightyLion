Chapter 373: Untitled

The night was quiet and the moonlight was gentle.

The cold night wind quietly brushed against the water.

When the little girl was in the water, she did not feel cold. However, when she finished washing her body and beautiful hair and stood up, she suddenly shivered in the cold.

She cowered and looked at the skirt and bra in the grass by the pit. Just as she was about to reach out to take them, she suddenly realized that there were some strange things on her skirt.

Catherine squatted at the side and watched silently.

Chu Xiaoye had long left.

The little girl was stunned for a moment before she reached out to pick up one of them. She suddenly realized that it was a thick fur that looked like pants\!

Furthermore, it seemed to be tailored to the length of her legs\!

She knew this fur. It was the fur of the pride's prey, the gazelle.

However, how did the gazelle's fur become something that looked like pants?

Although it was a little rough and looked ugly, it really looked like a pair of pants. Furthermore, it was very thick and had soft fur. It would definitely be very warm when worn.

The little girl looked at the pants and was stunned for a moment. She suddenly turned around and looked at Catherine.

Catherine looked at her quietly with a deep gaze and no emotions.

The little girl raised her head and looked at the dark forest, but she did not see the familiar and familiar figure.

"Whoosh â€”"

A cold wind blew and her body trembled.

She did not dare to hesitate and immediately got up from the waterhole. She looked around again and lowered her head, trembling as she put on the gazelle leather pants.

The sun's warmth lingered on her pants and she immediately felt much warmer wearing them.

She lowered her head and looked at another item.

This was still a gazelle skin. It was cut from the neck and turned into a hat. It was cut from the abdomen and turned into a dividing line in the middle of the clothes.

The little girl widened her eyes, not knowing if she was surprised or in disbelief.

She immediately picked up the shirt and wore it.

In an instant, she felt warm, as if she had wrapped herself in a thick blanket and returned to the warm room with the air conditioner on.

The cold wind outside could not blow on her anymore.

Furthermore, this top was cut very well. The length and width of the two sleeves were just right, and the gap in the middle could be closed. The bottom was very long, and it covered her calves and wrapped her entire body tightly.

It was so warm\!

The little girl narrowed her eyes happily and wrapped her clothes tightly. She would never tremble in the cold again and not freeze like a little quail.

However, if she could have a belt, thenâ€¦

Suddenly, she realized that there was also a long antelope skin on her dress. She picked it up and saw that it was a belt that was tied at her waist to make her clothes not open\!

The little girl was extremely happy. She immediately tied her belt at her waist and deliberately tied a big bow.

"Is it beautiful?"

The little girl turned around and faced Catherine. She blinked her innocent big eyes and said happily.

She wanted to share her happiness with this beautiful and quiet lioness cub, because there was no one else here other than her.

Catherine looked at the clothes on her in a daze, and her dark eyes flickered.

So this was how these things were used.

This pitiful little animal did not have a thick fur to resist the cold. Therefore, the king used the gazelle skin to make two for her to wear.

However, wouldn't this make this little animal a little gazelle?

"It's so warm\!"

The little girl tiptoed and turned around happily. She jumped around for a while before picking up her skirt and bra and washing them in the waterhole.

Although this thin white dress might not be used here anymore, it was at least a memento. She had to keep it well.

Catherine squatted silently at the side and finished everything with her.

The little girl took the washed clothes and returned to the pride's camp. She hung the clothes on the low bushes and realized that the little leather shoes and socks that were originally hanging on them were gone.

Was it stolen by someone?

She looked at the members of the pride who were lying in the camp to rest and looked at the grass in front of them, but she did not discover her small leather shoes and long socks.

She raised her head and looked at the tree. The baddie king was not on it either and she did not know where it went.

Was she going to sleep alone tonight?

No, she believed that the bad king would definitely come and accompany her.

The little girl stopped pursuing the direction of the shoes and socks and turned to leave. She walked in front of the dense bushes and suddenly realized that there were a few layers of thick cowhide and some soft white fur inside.

The little girl could not help but cry out in surprise. She immediately lay on it. It was soft and warm. It no longer had the hardness and coldness from before.

It was like a soft bed.

However, where did he get these white fur? They looked a little familiar.

Forget it. She could finally sleep well.

However, the little girl was too excited and no longer felt sleepy. She tossed and turned on the soft blanket and could not help but giggle. From time to time, she would poke her head out and look outside.

However, that figure did not return for a long time.

As the owner of the territory and the king of the pride, Chu Xiaoye naturally could not be lazy all the time.

Tonight, he brought Mei Mei to patrol the river and observe the enemies in the water.

No enemy could be underestimated.

These giant crocodiles were strong and only lacked intelligence and sensitivity. Once some of their members broke through these shackles, they would be a terrifying existence.

The pride's camp was nearby. He had to pay attention to the movements here at all times.

However, he did not want to be wiped out by these underwater killers who had been hiding in this river for many years when they were always vigilant of their opponents on land.

However, the strange thing was that Chu Xiaoye brought Mei Mei along the river for a long time and did not find a crocodile.

There had always been a lot of crocodiles in this river. Even at night, there were usually many herbivores who would climb up the riverbank to breathe or ambush them to drink water.

But now, he could not see a single one.

The situation was a little strange.

The river flowed quietly and the moonlight shone on it. It was sparkling. Although it was beautiful, the silence was terrifying.

Chu Xiaoye carried his doubts and continued to walk along the river with Mei Mei.

"Roarâ€”"

Right at this moment, the furious roars of the sisters and the terrified rescue of the Chino brothers suddenly came from the grassland on the other side of the bushes.

At the same time, the ground trembled and rumbled like thunder\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and immediately ran over with Mei Mei.

At this moment, the panicked roars of Mixed Fur and Blue Eyes sounded at the same time. The cold father only had time to roar before he was drowned in the rolling hooves.

A violent killing intent pounced towards this territory\!

Chu Xiaoye passed through the bushes and specifically circled around to where the little girl was sleeping. He roared anxiously at Catherine, who was still quietly waiting there, and told her to quickly bring the little girl up the tree to hide.

An enemy that could make Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur so terrified was definitely not ordinary\!

The little girl stuck her head out of the bushes and saw him rush over like a gust of wind. She opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but it was already too late.

Catherine immediately crawled under her and carried her as she ran towards the tall Baobab tree.

The little girl spread her golden hair and hugged her neck tightly. She turned her head and looked at the figure with its mane flying and quickly disappearing into the distance. She muttered in her heart, "King, you have to come back. Annie is waiting for you."

The members of the pride rushed out of the bushes and roared angrily, fighting back bravely against the invading enemy.

Even Pit and Little Mi, who were sleeping in the cave, crawled out to cheer.

The little girl sat on the tree and was not to be outdone. She suddenly raised her little fist and shouted, "King, all the best\!"
