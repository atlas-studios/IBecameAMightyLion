Chapter 540: Scheme within a Scheme

Chu Xiaoye could see very far.

Therefore, even before the people standing on the tall city looked at them from afar, he had already seen the crossbowmen and the flag of the Lusni family on Bingluo city.

Carter had once told him that the family emblem of the Lusni family was a sword stuck in a red tombstone.

The flag that fluttered in the wind and the bright red sword were very striking in his eyes.

When they arrived more than 200 meters away from the city, the flag on the city suddenly retracted and the crossbowmen disappeared.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye knew at that moment that this city might have changed owners.

It was impossible to take a detour. He would never take a detour in his life. Attacking was too dangerous. He could only play along.

Through his conversation with this old city lord, Chu Xiaoye obtained very useful information.

The old city lord was not a supporter of the Lusni family, and he was not prepared to collude with the Lusni family. He was just forced into a corner.

Perhaps it was useful for the time being to use the citizens of the city to threaten this old man, but the old man's reputation and prestige in this city were not to be trifled with. The citizens and the twenty thousand troops here would still support and trust him.

There were 50,000 soldiers of the Lusni family in the city holding them hostage.

However, the goal of the Lusni family was not them, but Princess Carter, who had returned from the border with the army.

However, their plan failed.

Princess Carter did not enter the city. Instead, the army circled around and left.

However, there was still hope.

At this moment, Princess Carter was probably walking slowly on the road in front of her, or waiting for the gifts the Bingluo City had promised to give her.

When Chu Xiaoye and the others and the members of the Mormont family were imprisoned in the cell, the army of the Lusni family took advantage of the night and went out of another city gate with a murderous aura.

At the front were thousands of troops wearing the attire of the Mormont family and holding up the emblem of the Mormont family. They were all members of the Lusni family.

Wasn't Princess Carter waiting for the gold coins of the five thousand soldiers and the five carriages?

Then, they were here\!

They brought the carriages and more soldiers with a murderous aura\!

Carter had nearly forty thousand troops and they were all warriors who had experienced hundreds of battles at the border. Their combat strength was very strong. Therefore, in order to be safe, the Lusni family brought away forty-five thousand people and left more than five thousand behind to guard Bingluo City.

These five thousand plus people controlled the highest castle in Bingluo City and the richest and most influential people inside.

Therefore, it looked very safe.

Furthermore, the army that had left the city of the Lusni family did not walk too far and could return at any time.

In the opinion of the leader of the Lusni army, Cesar, this old city lord of Bingluo City was a very sensible and smart old man. If he dared to resist, what awaited him would definitely be the anger of the Lusni army. The entire city and the citizens here would suffer\!

The moon was not bad tonight.

Cesar, who was riding a horse, looked up. He did not seem to be too nervous.

The other party was not prepared. He believed that this unexpected attack would definitely shock Princess Carter. Then, she would panic and flee in a sorry state.

He really wanted to see how cute the princess general who had made outstanding contributions to the border would look later.

The five carriages walked in front. The outside was decorated very luxuriously, and inside, there were not splashing gold coins, but the warriors of the Lusni family.

"General\! I see them\!"

At this moment, a knight rode back and reported in a low voice.

Cesar looked up. In the bright moonlight, many figures appeared on the hill. Some were standing, some were sitting. They looked loose and had no military discipline.

Were they the warriors under Princess Carter?

Cesar revealed a mocking smile and said, "Go over directly. There are forty thousand troops following behind the five thousand troops. In the night, they won't have the time to see clearly. If the other party asks, just tell him that Lord Mormont gave them this gift."

"Yes, General\!"

The knight turned around and ran in front.

When the army walked more than 100 meters away, the other party indeed questioned loudly.

"Who is it?"

The knight answered loudly, "People of Bingluo City\! Lord Mormont sent me to serve the army and gold coins on the peak of Princess Carter\!"

With that said, the knight waved his hand and the army immediately quickened their steps.

"It seems to be more than 5,000."

The soldiers opposite seemed to be discussing.

The knight still said loudly, "Lord Mormont was afraid that the princess would be unhappy, so he sent more people over. Where is the princess? I want to meet her and present Lord Mormont's gift\!"

At this moment, the distance between the two sides had already decreased by 50 meters.

"Stop first\! I'll report to the princess\!"

Just as the soldier opposite him finished saying this, Cesar suddenly pulled out his sword and raised it above his head, roaring, "Kill—"

"Kill—"

The Lusni army immediately roared and started to sprint.

The carriage at the front suddenly stopped and tall and strong orcs jumped down from it, roaring as they rushed at the front.

"There's a trap\!"

"Run\!"

The soldier opposite him did not hesitate and turned to run, letting out a terrified scream.

"So it's a group of trash\!"

When Cesar saw this scene, he was relieved. He roared as he rushed up and shouted, "Under the king's orders, we will catch the traitor, Carter\! Those who surrender are not guilty\!"

The soldiers at the front fled, but many more stopped in place, seemingly preparing to resist.

"Kill those who resist\!"

Cesar rushed up with the army and roared.

However, when they rushed close, the burly orcs at the front suddenly realized that something was wrong.

When the weapons in their hands slashed at the soldiers, they realized that these soldiers were only tree branches wearing clothes\!

"Oh no\! It's a trap\!"

At this moment, they finally reacted.

However, it was already too late to retreat.

The forest on both sides of the road suddenly roared and ran. "Kill—"

Cesar's face was pale as he hurriedly roared, "Retreat\! Retreat\!"

This place was not too far from Bingluo City. As long as he fought and retreated, he could still be invincible if he retreated to Bingluo City\!

However, right at this moment, the army behind him was suddenly in chaos\!

Carter actually brought all the cavalry and circled behind them. At this moment, she was riding a war horse and stabbing in from behind them like an arrow, killing wantonly\!

Those warhorses were extremely valiant and were wrapped in armor with sharp spikes. Even if the cavalry on them did not attack, these running warhorses were not something the soldiers on the ground could resist.

In order to catch them off guard, Cesar placed all the cavalry at the front and the foot soldiers at the back.

At this moment, the foot soldiers could not retaliate at all. Other than sending themselves to death, they fled in panic and instantly confused the entire army\!

Cesar's cavalry could not run at all and lost all their might. What was even more terrifying was that the foot soldiers following behind were charging forward to mess up his cavalry\!

Because he had just roared and ordered a retreat, the tall and sturdy orc at the front and the cavalry beside him turned their horses and moved back in panic.

Hence, his own army turned into two torrents and started to resist the collision\!

"Kill—"

Carter brought the cavalry and ferociously cut and chased the infantry\!

A dense orc army also rushed out of the forest on both sides of the road, forcing the army of the Lusni family into a corner\!

"Steady\! Steady\! Kill\!"

Cesar raised his sword and wanted to stabilize the army to counterattack, but he realized that it was already too late. The entire army was already in chaos.

"General\! In front\! We can go forward\!"

The knight reminded him loudly.

Cesar raised his head and looked in the direction of Bingluo City. His heart was in pain and regret, but he did not dare to hesitate anymore. He immediately raised his sword and pointed it forward, roaring, "Charge forward\!"

Hence, the cavalry could only turn their horses around with difficulty and charge forward.

Then, the dented road in front of him was actually filled with trees that blocked the entire road\!

At this moment, they were riding their warhorses and charging down the hill in a hurry. When they were close, they realized in fear\!

"Be careful\! Be careful\!"

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The warhorses at the front could not stop in time and were tripped and sent flying.

Cesar roared in despair, "Fight\! Fight them\!"

This was destined to be a one-sided battle\!

At this moment, the city was still brightly lit and bustling.

Chu Xiaoye, who was imprisoned in the cell, also started to move.
