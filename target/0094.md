Chapter 94: Battle

 The night was very quiet.

An unfamiliar aura suddenly came from the dry air.

The cold father, who was sleeping, suddenly opened his eyes and stood up from the grass. He looked solemnly in the direction of the hill.

He instinctively sensed danger.

Soon, three strong figures appeared in his vision.

The three lions walked side by side. They did not roar as they quietly walked towards the camp.

"Roar—"

The cold father's furious roar suddenly sounded in the camp\!

The five female lions, who were sleeping, hurriedly got up and looked into the distance.

Seeing that their tracks had been exposed, the three lions immediately bared their fangs and let out provocative roars. They increased their steps and ran.

Their manes fluttered as their killing intent surged. Their faces were fierce and ferocious.

The cold father's eyes revealed a hint of fear, as if he recalled Bill's tragic death in the past.

Then, he thought of Seno during the day.

Just as he was hesitating and conflicted, the roar of a female lion suddenly came from behind.

He turned around and saw that the female lion had already arrived beside him. She bared her fangs and her remaining eye was filled with determination and ferocity.

She stood beside him\!

"Roar—"

Aisha roared and walked over to stand beside Xi'er.

The other three female lions, including the pregnant Maya, only hesitated for a moment before walking over as well. They bared their fangs and looked at the three ferocious wandering lions\!

They would fight side by side with him\!

The cold father was stunned for a moment before he suddenly saw two figures walking over from behind.

Mei Mei walked over and stood beside her mother.

Little Curly Tail walked over and stood beside his mother.

These two young cubs stood beside their mothers, their eyes filled with a bright and determined light\!

They did not seem to be afraid\!

The fear and timidity in the cold father's heart suddenly turned to nothingness at this moment\!

He bared his fangs and let out a brave roar. His gaze was fierce as he was the first to charge forward\!

The five female lions and the two young cubs followed closely\!

When the three wandering lions saw that this pride was breaking the rules again, they were furious and pounced ferociously\!

They wanted to make this pride pay a heavy price\!

The cold father pounced on a wandering lion and roared as he bit it.

Xi'er and Aisha bit another wandering lion.

Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail circled around to attack\!

The other three female lions fought with the remaining wandering lion.

Immediately, roars were endless and blood was everywhere\!

When the cold father discovered the three wandering lions and let out his first roar, Chu Xiaoye, who was training in the bushes at the back, had already heard the sound.

He immediately jumped down from the tree and ran back at his fastest speed.

Catherine hurriedly followed behind him, not afraid that he would discover her.

If the pride encountered a crisis, she would be responsible\!

The cold father and the first wandering lion fought intensely. It was difficult to determine the victor at that moment.

The second wandering lion was soon no match for him.

Xi'er and Aisha's frontal attack was extremely fierce\!

Every time this lion wanted to pounce on them and bite them, two young cubs would pounce on him from behind and use their sharp claws to fiercely grab his butt and thigh\!

After a while, his back was badly mutilated and dripping with blood.

Every time he flew into a rage and turned around to bite the two young cubs, the two little fellows would run extremely quickly. He could not catch up to them at all\!

Being attacked from the front and back, he was soon riddled with wounds and exhausted.

He wanted to escape, but he was afraid that these two fierce female lions would take the opportunity to pounce on him and bite him.

Seeing that the wounds on his body were increasing and he was about to lose his balance, he suddenly roared angrily and jumped up. He opened his bloody mouth and pounced at the one-eyed female lion in front of him without care\!

He wanted to bite the most ferocious lioness to death first\!

However, just as he jumped up, a tail that looked like a whip suddenly jumped out from behind him. With a whoosh, it crawled in between his legs and wrapped around his penis, pulling hard\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly let out a miserable scream as his body turned limp and he fell heavily to the ground with a bang\!

A sharp pain came from his crotch, causing all the strength in his body to turn to nothingness\!

He hurriedly turned around and wanted to bite it\!

The tail suddenly yanked again with greater strength\!

"Roar—"

He let out another miserable scream as his body trembled and he fell to the ground. He was in so much pain that his mouth was wide open and his entire body was trembling\!

Xi'er and Aisha immediately took this opportunity to pounce on it and bite it ferociously.

Mei Mei, who was behind him, also jumped up and jumped on his back, biting his spine\!

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

The wandering lion's spine was broken\!

Before he could let out a miserable scream, another heart-wrenching pain came from his crotch\!

Little Curly Tail had his back facing him and was leaning forward and crawling forward with all his might. As for his tail, it was straight\!

The wandering lion's body, which was more than 100 kilograms, was actually dragged back slowly by him\!

"Roar—"

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

This was really painful\!

Ouch\! Ouch\! Ouch\! Ouch\!

His entire body twitched, and his mouth was wide open. He was about to faint\!

"Crack\!"

Xi'er bit his neck\!

On the other side.

Just as Callie and two other female lions were fighting the wandering lion, a figure suddenly rushed over from afar, jumped up, and landed\!

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light flashed\!

Half of this wandering lion's face immediately fell to the ground\!

Before he could scream, Chu Xiaoye suddenly bit his lush neck\!

"Roar—"

The wandering lion let out a miserable roar and swung its body crazily, wanting to shake him off\!

At this moment, Callie, Maya, and the lioness with a broken tail pounced on him and bit his abdomen and thigh\!

"Bang\!"

His tall and strong body finally fell to the ground.

As for the cold father's side.

Catherine rushed over and circled behind him. Her sharp claws grabbed at the wandering lion's butt and abdomen with lightning speed\!

Every hit was so deep that bones could be seen\!

The wandering lion hurriedly turned around and wanted to flee\!

The cold father pounced forward and pressed him to the ground. He took the opportunity to bite his throat\!

Catherine rushed up again and grabbed his soft abdomen\!

Her two claws were fast and fierce\!

In just a few swipes, she actually pulled out the wandering lion's intestines\!

The cold father, who was biting the neck of a wandering lion, immediately stared blankly as his heart turned cold.
