Chapter 386: Untitled

The storm was attacking\!

Darkness devoured the sky and disaster surged into the grassland.

The waves that had accumulated on the sea for a long time hit the steep coastline one after another with a destructive might, forming huge water walls that overlapped like a terrifying giant beast that bared its fangs and brandished its claws as it pounced at the grassland\!

The grass was instantly submerged and the bushes were broken.

On the grassland, the animals that had yet to leave realized and fled in panic, but it was already too late.

In the blink of an eye, they were devoured by the huge wave and disappeared.

The huge waves surged onto the grassland, but their strength did not weaken. Under the superimposition of the subsequent waves, they became even more turbulent and strong, and they even flew into the air\!

On the grassland, a giraffe that was more than ten meters tall after evolution did not leave early, perhaps because it was old or injured. At this moment, it was running on the grassland with its four long legs.

However, in the blink of an eye, a huge wave flew over and drowned its head. The terrifying strength instantly broke its neck and crushed it to the ground.

A huge rhinoceros that had mutated and weighed four to five tons was sent flying by a huge wave as it ran in fear. After landing, it disappeared.

These tall and strong animals that ran wild on the grassland seemed so fragile at this moment.

All life only revealed their fragility at this moment.

No one could resist the anger of nature\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, he was naturally no exception.

Originally, he had been eager to fight on this grassland with a group of experts and ascend to the throne of the king of the grassland again to live his majestic life.

Now, he could only bring his team, abandon his home, and flee in a sorry state. He was even more pitiful than a stray dog.

What was most annoying was that the majestic golden-haired lion king had now become a white socks lion king. On its back was a little loli with fluttering golden hair who was even more majestic than him\!

After running dozens of kilometers at high speed, the members of the pride were panting heavily. Their limbs were limp and they were exhausted.

Until this moment, they still did not know why they suddenly left their homes and ran in panic.

Qiqi and Nunu slowed down and wanted to stop and rest.

The female lions were also panting from exhaustion. They slowed down, their eyes filled with confusion.

The cold father was already exhausted and his heart was filled with anger. He wanted to ask why that unfilial son tortured them like this, but he was afraid that his stupidity would provoke a joke.

"Roar\!"

Seeing that everyone had slowed down, Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily with a fierce expression.

Qiqi and Nunu could not run anymore and stopped, wanting to act spoiled.

However, before Chu Xiaoye could move, Catherine had already rushed over and slapped them heavily.

Beside them, although Maya was a little angry, she did not dare to do anything. She could only growl and urge the two little fellows to continue running.

Qiqi and Nunu were frightened by Catherine's cold gaze. They immediately got up and started running again.

The cold father, who wanted to complain, did not dare to think further when he saw this scene. He could only continue to run with all his might.

Finally, they saw the tall mountain range in front of them.

Chu Xiaoye was not careless. He immediately roared anxiously and rushed into the forest with the team.

The continuous mountain range was at the end of the grassland, bordered by the mountain range they had crossed when they moved over. To the left was the mountain range, and to the right were more majestic mountains.

To the right was the path to the snow mountain.

The snow mountain faced the sea. At this moment, no one knew if a disaster had happened there. Furthermore, it was not suitable for foreign prides to survive.

The straight distance was the shortest and fastest.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and rushed towards the majestic mountain range in front of him.

When they rushed into the forest, the faint roar of a huge wave finally came from behind. The entire ground seemed to be trembling.

Chu Xiaoye turned around, his eyes flickering with a golden light that pierced through the dark night and looked back.

On the distant horizon, a huge wave rushed into the sky\!

In the blink of an eye, the entire world seemed to be submerged by the roaring sea\!

The sky became smaller and the grassland became lesser and lesser\!

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared anxiously and immediately brought the team into the forest. He followed the steep and rugged hill and quickly climbed up.

At this moment, the other members of the pride finally felt fear.

Qiqi and Nunu, who had fallen behind, climbed up the hill with all their might and followed behind. Even though they were panting and had fallen a few times, they still pushed forward with all their might.

"Boom\!"

The rumbling of the huge waves rolled over like thunder.

The cold father climbed up the hill and looked back. He immediately trembled in fear and widened his eyes. He did not stop at all and jumped out agilely with a whoosh.

The birds and little animals in the forest all left their nests and caves in panic and ran up the mountain.

In the blink of an eye, the huge wave had already arrived from the horizon. It was terrifyingly fast\!

The green grassland had already become a vast sea. Waves that were baring their fangs and brandishing their claws like giant beasts were devouring everything on the grassland cruelly at their fastest speed.

At this moment, all the members of the pride had already seen the terrifying wave behind them.

Before Chu Xiaoye could urge them, they squeezed out all the strength and strength in their bodies and climbed to the top of the mountain without care. No one could care less.

"Boom\!"

The huge wave rushed close and slapped fiercely on the tall and lush trees at the foot of the mountain. It instantly broke the trees and even uprooted them\!

The wave that was obstructed flew up\!

Under Chu Xiaoye's lead, the pride had already climbed halfway up the mountain. In order to not be slapped by the huge wave that flew up, they turned into a dented ridge and continued to climb up.

The huge waves were crashing wave after wave, each more ferocious than the last. They were higher and higher, as if they were going to fly to the top of the mountain and into the sky\!

The cold father almost peed his pants. Although he was so tired that he was about to faint, he did not dare to stop at all.

The little girl riding on Chu Xiaoye's back no longer had the mood to play. She turned around and widened her eyes, looking at the roaring waves and sea at the foot of the mountain in shock and fear. Her face was pale and her body was trembling.

If they did not see it with their own eyes, who would have thought that the lush green grassland a moment ago would suddenly become a vast sea in the next moment?

The anger of nature did not seem to stop.

Under the obstruction of the mountain range, the surging sea formed even larger waves and strength again. As it slapped the mountain range, it spread out\!

The grass and trees that had obtained huge energy from the two blood rain and were growing crazily were destroyed and devoured by this disaster in the blink of an eye.

All his efforts and surprises were wasted.

The entire mountain range seemed to be trembling from the waves.

The sky was covered in dark clouds, but a weak ray of moonlight was revealed. It shone on the threatening sea, causing this ferocious beast to look even more ferocious and terrifying\!

Finally, Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and climbed up the mountain peak.

The sea at the foot of the mountain was still roaring, but it seemed to have given up on them and started to surge in other directions.

Heavy panting rose and fell in a rock pile on the mountain.

The surrounding forest was lush and towered into the clouds, but it could not hide the ferocious faces and terrifying roars of the ferocious beasts at the foot of the mountain.

Every member was trembling.

Including Chu Xiaoye.

They had lost their home and the grassland. Where should they go now?

On the other side of the mountain, it was still a mountain. It was continuous and layered.

Under the mountain were primitive forests. The trees were tall, lush, and sparsely populated. They were ancient and long. Even the air was filled with a primitive smell.

That was not where lions lived.
