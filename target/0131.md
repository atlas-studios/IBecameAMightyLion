Chapter 131: Ultimate Technique

The ferocity of hyenas was famous in the grassland.

Furthermore, they were extremely hungry.

The young elephant's body was enough for each of them to eat a full meal.

And this underage cub abandoned by the pride would become their delicious meal\!

They did not refuse anyone\!

The leading female hyena was the first to rush up.

It attacked from behind and pounced at Chu Xiaoye's butt, preparing to bite his butt into pieces\!

If this inexperienced cub suddenly jumped up, it would immediately use its hyena arts and take the opportunity to bite his penis\!

This way, the battle would immediately end\!

However, when it pounced behind the cub, the cub was still lying on the ground with no intention of standing up.

The female hyena was furious and bit his butt\!

As long as the cub jumped up in pain, it could still use the hyena technique\!

However, before she could bite, the cub suddenly raised its tail and aimed its anus at her.

The female hyena was stunned and immediately rejoiced\!

Their other ultimate technique was finally useful\!

"Pfftâ€”"

Right at this moment, a strong black smoke suddenly sprayed out from the little lion's butt. It was like a strong wind that directly distorted its face and its whiskers flew backwards. Even its two round ears swayed\!

An extremely terrifying stench instantly followed its nostrils and open mouth and jumped into its throat and body\!

In an instant, it felt the world spin and its vision turned dark\!

Thick black smoke covered its entire head and body\!

It could not help but take a few steps back when its head suddenly tilted and it fell to the ground unconscious\!

As for the little elephant, who was hiding behind Chu Xiaoye on the right, it seemed to be drunk and was swaying unsteadily.

However, to Chu Xiaoye's surprise, the little elephant took the initiative to take another step forward and deliberately placed its long nose near his butt, as if it wanted to smell it again\!

This pervert\!

Chu Xiaoye swung his tail and slapped its long nose\!

At this moment, the stench was already quickly spreading in all directions.

The hyenas that even ate rotten meat retreated in panic and started to lower their heads, vomiting.

They had not eaten for a few days. Now that they were vomiting crazily, they immediately felt dizzy and their limbs felt like jelly. They could not stand steadily.

Chu Xiaoye did not expect that his smelly fart would be surprisingly effective against this group of ferocious enemies.

He recovered some strength and immediately got up to leave.

If the hyenas pounced on him ferociously again at this moment, he would really have no strength to fight.

The effect of the anesthetic in his body made him feel weak all over and he could not use much strength.

He did not want to die under their sharp teeth.

When the little elephant saw him get up and leave, it hurriedly swayed and followed behind him.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look and could not understand.

Did he really not look like a carnivore at all?

Forget it.

He had to escape first and wait for his strength to slowly recover.

The grassland in front of him was already dry. Even the withered grass had disappeared completely.

He wondered if there were still some water sources on the upper reaches of the river further away.

If there was still water there, many herbivores would gather there.

Seeing that the elephant had left with him, the hyenas immediately vomited all the way and chased after him. They let out sharp cries, as if they were cursing.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them.

These fellows should be like him and probably did not have much combat strength left.

Suddenly, a sparse forest appeared in front of him.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes lit up and he quickened his steps.

He decided to hide there and recover his strength.

At that time, after killing the hyenas at the back, he could enjoy the fat and tender meat of this little elephant alone.

The little elephant swung its nose and followed behind him slowly, like a young and ignorant child taking the initiative to follow the cheat who wanted to abduct him to trade.

However, Chu Xiaoye had never deceived it.

When he arrived at the forest, Chu Xiaoye suddenly saw a cheetah. With a whoosh, it ran over from afar and suddenly pounced at a fleeing black antelope\!

On the head of the black antelope were two long and sharp horns. Its body was extremely strong and was much larger than the slender and small cheetah.

However, it was still pounced onto the ground by the agile cheetah and bitten its throat\!

However, this black antelope was extremely strong. It was unwilling to be eaten and struggled with all its might.

The exhausted cheetah was actually pressed under it and dragged forward\!

At this moment, two little cheetahs suddenly ran out from the grass beside him. They immediately pounced to the side of the black antelope and bit its thigh.

However, their teeth were not enough to pose a threat to the black antelope. They could not even bite through its skin.

They were anxious.

The black antelope continued to struggle with all its might, lowering its head and twisting its neck.

The cheetah mother, who was biting its neck, was finally a little exhausted and the antelope struggled out of its mouth.

However, the cheetah mother was unwilling to give up. She immediately turned around and hugged the black antelope's head, preparing to bite its nose and suffocate it\!

Usually, lions would use this method to deal with large carnivores. Otherwise, they would not have enough strength.

However, this young cheetah mother had clearly underestimated this strong opponent.

The black antelope suddenly swung its head and jolted her out. Then, it lowered its head and the two long and sharp horns pierced into the cheetah mother's stomach\!

The cheetah mother immediately felt extreme pain and wanted to get up.

The black antelope became braver and braver as it continued to lower its head and use its two sharp horns to pick and stab\!

The cheetah mother was terrified. She waved her claws in panic, but could not get up no matter what.

As for the two little cheetahs, they ran around anxiously in panic.

Finally, the black antelope raised its head and quickly jumped away.

The cheetah mother got up from the ground with difficulty. Her abdomen was dripping with blood, and her internal organs could almost be seen.

She opened her mouth and panted as she looked at the fleeing black antelope. Her gaze seemed to be filled with frustration and fear.

If cheetahs were injured, most of them would starve to death.

Furthermore, she still had two children.

The two little cheetahs ran to her side and rubbed against her legs affectionately. They did not seem to know that their mother had suffered a fatal wound.

Chu Xiaoye, who had just entered the forest, suddenly thought of the little leopard when he saw this scene.
