Chapter 65: Giraffe

Evening.

The forest was still hot.

Under the lead of the lionesses, the pride passed through the orchard and walked towards the Acacia Tree forest in front.

The thorny Acacia Tree was still full of green leaves.

This was a giraffe's favorite food.

The lion, the cold father, followed behind and walked slowly. He looked uncomfortable from the heat and could only open his mouth to cool down.

In a while, when hunting the giraffe, he would be the main hunter.

Only his body and weight could make the prey fall to the ground when he bit the giraffe's neck.

Of course.

This was also an extremely dangerous task.

A moment of carelessness would result in heavy injuries.

However, hunger and responsibility forced him to do it personally.

He had not hunted for a long time.

When he was wandering alone outside, he was also a hunting expert. Otherwise, he would not have survived to this day.

Ever since he had the pride, his hunting skills gradually became rusty.

Therefore, he was actually very nervous about hunting this time.

Suddenly.

Aisha, who was walking in front, stopped in her tracks. She narrowed her eyes and looked at the Acacia Tree forest in front of her.

A giraffe was in the forest, eating the tender leaves on the branches. Its short tail was wagging happily.

Behind it, there was a smaller giraffe standing beside a big tree in a daze. It leaned its head against the branch and did not move.

It was sleeping.

The giraffe slept very little.

In order to avoid danger, they could sleep for only two hours a day for 24 hours.

Due to their long necks, they usually slept while standing and leaned their necks against the branches to avoid feeling too tired.

They would occasionally lie down and sleep, but when standing up, they would need to spend an entire minute. This would be a very dangerous thing and not beneficial for escaping.

At the same time, their hearing and vision were very sharp. Their eyes could even see what was behind them.

Therefore, this animal was not easy to catch.

If the pride wanted to catch it successfully, they had to use the cover of the bushes to approach it quietly.

Furthermore, he could not let it run out of the forest.

Once it reached an open area, it would move its four strong long legs and run very quickly.

The pride could not catch up to them at all, nor did they dare to chase after them, let alone pounce on them to stop them.

At this moment.

The five female lions quietly spread out and crawled into the bushes at the side. They circled the road and surrounded the sleeping giraffe in front of them.

The lion immediately lay down and hid in the dense grass, waiting for the female lions to chase their prey over.

His gaze was cold and his muscles were tense. He looked very nervous.

The hot weather made him keep his mouth open and breathe heavily, unable to calm down.

Lars hesitated for a moment, walked into the bushes not far away, and lay down.

He was afraid of behemoths like giraffes.

He did not want to stay with his father and be kicked out by a hoof later.

However, he liked this delicacy.

This was definitely enough to fill him up.

In order to avoid being discovered by the giraffe that was eating, the five female lions went very far and circled to the front. Then, they started to close in a fan shape.

They blocked the path from the bushes to the vast grassland.

After being frightened, the two giraffes could only flee towards the bushes that the cold father was hiding in\!

At that time, it would be time for their king to perform.

The five female lions lowered their bodies and quietly approached.

At this moment, the giraffe that was eating the tender leaves on the branches suddenly became alert and immediately ran away\!

It ran towards Callie\!

The sleeping giraffe immediately woke up and hurriedly followed its companion, running away in panic\!

Callie's stomach was already very big, and there was no way she could stop the two running giraffes.

She could only stand up, bare her fangs, and roar ferociously, wanting to scare them.

The first giraffe panicked and ignored her. It raised its long legs and charged at her\!

Callie could only dodge in panic and flee to the side.

If she was kicked, not only would the child in her stomach be difficult to protect, she might also lose her life.

The first giraffe immediately rushed out of the encirclement and ran towards the distant grassland.

The second one followed closely\!

At this moment, Xi'er, who only had one eye left, suddenly rushed out of the forest beside him and blocked the path of the second giraffe\!

She did not dodge. Instead, she roared angrily and charged straight at the running giraffe\!

Her gaze was determined and her movements were fierce. She let out a terrifying roar\!

Her courage and ferocity immediately frightened the second giraffe.

The giraffe stopped in fear and immediately turned around to flee to the right\!

At this moment, Aisha also roared and rushed out of the forest on the right\!

She was also brave and fierce. She bared her fangs and charged forward bravely\!

The giraffe immediately panicked and changed directions to charge into the bushes\!

In the end, it fell into a trap and was frightened by the brave Xi'er and Aisha.

If it had really dashed forward recklessly, Xi'er and Aisha would never have dared to pounce on it.

This was a battle of courage.

In its fear, it ran towards the lion that was hiding in the bushes\!

The five female lions immediately gathered together and roared as they chased after him\!

Their small bodies could run very well through the dense bushes.

The tall giraffe had no choice but to slow down.

When it ran into the dense bushes, its running speed became even slower.

However, even so, its four strong and long legs were still a great deterrent to the pride.

The cold father lay in the dense grass and watched as the huge creature got closer and closer. All the muscles in his body immediately trembled nervously.

But fortunately, the giraffe slowed down.

"Whooshâ€”"

The cold father no longer hesitated. While it was passing through a bush, he suddenly pounced forward\!

He erupted with terrifying speed and strength. After sprinting for dozens of meters, he suddenly jumped and flew ferociously at the giraffe's long neck like a cannonball\!

He opened his mouth and bared his sharp fangs. The moment he hit the giraffe's neck, he quickly pierced the fangs into its skin\!

His four sharp claws also pierced tightly into the neck of the giraffe\!

However, he still underestimated the giraffe's strength\!

Furthermore, he made a mistake.

He should not have pounced at the giraffe head-on. Instead, he should have followed his prey and pounced from the side like the female lions did to reduce the force of the collision.

He was too confident\!

Although the giraffe had slowed down, it was still very strong\!

In the collision, it suddenly swung its neck. The cold father could not grab it firmly and was immediately sent flying\!

"Bang\!"

He fell miserably into the bushes at the side.

Fortunately, those soft branches and lush leaves saved his life.

He got up, but he was a little dizzy.

Lars, who was hiding in the bushes not far away, was frightened by this scene and retreated a distance.

At this moment.

The five female lions had already caught up and started to pounce on the giraffe from the side.

However, the giraffe was too tall and its legs were too long. They could not pounce on its back in such a short time, let alone bite its strong thigh\!

They could only chase and harass it while waiting for an opportunity to find its weakness.

About 100 meters ahead.

Chu Xiaoye was biting a thin green vine and winding it around the roots of the big tree beside him.

Then, he bit the other end of the green vine and climbed onto another big tree opposite, winding this end tightly around the first branch\!

The middle portion of the green vine was still very long and it landed in the grass on the ground.

He tried to bite the end of the branch that was wrapped around it. He swung his head and the green vine that fell to the ground could be pulled up.

Although it was raised diagonally and looked very loose, it should be enough.

However, he had to let go the moment he pulled it up.

Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

After doing all this, he raised his head and looked at the giraffe that was running over.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei stood on another tree and looked at him curiously.

They could not understand what their brother was doing.
