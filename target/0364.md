Chapter 364: Untitled

The massacre did not start.

To Chu Xiaoye's surprise, Blue Eyes's anger quickly subsided after the black-haired lion king died.

Not only did he let go of the five lions, he did not hurt the female lions that had betrayed him again. He only chased them out of the territory coldly.

The evolution brought by the blood rain was not only the changes in the bodies of creatures, but also their intelligence and feelings.

Chu Xiaoye was not sure at this moment. Blue Eyes looked at the group of pregnant female lions and thought of something. However, he knew that the blue eyes now were no longer the blue eyes of the past.

He was even stronger, but he did not seem to be as cruel as before.

The five lions fled in panic as if they had been pardoned.

As for the female lions with bulging stomachs, they were unwilling to leave.

They could not understand why Blue Eyes would chase them away.

Wouldn't the victorious lions usually happily accept the female lions in the territory? Even if they were pregnant, they were female lions after all. They could hunt, continue to reproduce, and expand their tribe.

Not only could the pregnant lionesses not understand Blue Eyes' actions, but the members of the pride of the cold father also did not.

Because this violated the rules of the past.

There was plenty of food and a wide territory here. If they left these female lions here, they could completely kill all the children after they gave birth. Then, they could continue to get pregnant, give birth to their cubs, and strengthen the pride.

With these female lions, he did not need to hunt arduously normally.

Why not?

The cold father's eyes flickered. He wished he could go forward and take the female lions for himself.

Aisha, Xi'er, and the other female lions could not understand either.

Their current team would consume a lot of food every day. They could not supply it with only a few female lions.

Aisha even walked to Chu Xiaoye's side and rubbed her head against his neck, hoping that her son could make a new decision.

However, Chu Xiaoye only gave her an apologetic look.

Although Blue Eyes's method was beyond his expectations, it suited his intentions.

He did not want to see the miserable outcome of those female lions after giving birth.

Furthermore, because this grassland was fertile, lush with grass, and had plenty of herbivores, the territory of the Blue Eyes was only about twenty square kilometers. Coupled with the forest territory near the river Chu Xiaoye had previously, it was only about thirty square kilometers and was just enough for his current team to use.

If there were more female lions, it would clearly be a little crowded.

Furthermore, Mixed Fur's team should have already arrived.

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye's heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Logically speaking, the Jiela sisters, who had stayed to protect the territory, should know that the territory of Blue Eyes belonged to him.

If Mixed Fur's team had already come, why would they tolerate the invasion and occupied this territory by the black-haired lion king?

Unless something unexpected happened.

Mixed Fur clearly thought of this too and looked at him anxiously.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze froze. He immediately brought the team and continued forward.

At this moment, the sun had already set and the sky was covered in dark clouds.

The distant sea breeze blew with a moist and cold aura, indicating that it was tomorrow's weather.

Before long, the vast forest in front of them appeared in their vision.

Chu Xiaoye was the first to step onto his territory, but he did not smell the sisters or the other lions.

The Chino brothers immediately roared and urged the sisters to come out to welcome them.

However, the grassland was as quiet as before, and there was no movement in the bushes. The sisters were nowhere to be seen.

None of Mixed Fur's pride appeared.

Mixed Fur was a little panicked and immediately roared loudly, but he did not get any response.

His three loyal subordinates did not appear either.

Before leaving, he let his three subordinates return and bring the pride over. Now, it seemed that something must have happened midway and his pride did not come.

Otherwise, with his pride, and Blue Eyes' pride, as well as the Jiela sisters, it was impossible for the black-haired lion king to occupy this territory with its strength.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team into the bushes and carefully searched for the aura left behind by the Jiela sisters.

Since Blue Eyes' territory was already occupied by the black-maned lion, this territory would definitely not be spared. No one knew if the Jiela sisters had already fled or died in battle.

Suddenly, a figure jumped out of the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw a strong male leopard that was even taller than the cold father.

"Roar â€”"

The Belita sisters immediately went forward excitedly.

This strong male leopard was their father, Blue.

Then, another female leopard walked out of the bushes with a big stomach.

Belita immediately abandoned her father and ran towards her mother.

The family of four enjoyed each other's company.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but walk over and interrupt the male leopard's intimacy with his daughter. He let out a low growl and asked him about the situation here.

He knew that this male leopard had always been very smart.

Blue looked at him and stared in surprise at the lush golden mane on his neck. His face revealed a human-like change in emotion.

Belia twisted her waist and went in front of Chu Xiaoye. She rubbed her head against the mane on Chu Xiaoye's neck and roared at her father, looking pleased as if she was showing off her man.

Chu Xiaoye resisted the urge to slap her and continued to look at the male leopard.

Blue turned around and looked at the members of the pride of the cold father before looking at him again. He growled and actually raised his claws to point at the river in the bushes.

"The Jiela sisters and Lina fled to the other side of the river."

"Mixed Fur's team did not arrive."

"Some of Blue Eyes' subordinates and children died and some fled."

"This territory was occupied."

Blue shook his head and expressed his helplessness.

His wife was pregnant. He had to protect his wife, and the black-haired lion king and the five lions were too strong. He did not dare to take the risk.

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the Jiela sisters were not killed.

He did not have the intention to blame this male leopard. Under the circumstances where there was a huge difference in strength, being able to survive was the most important.

He turned around and instructed the dejected Chino brothers to patrol the river. At the same time, he called out to the Jiela sisters and Lina with a roar.

He hoped that the three female lions did not escape too far.

At this moment, Pit, who was behind him suddenly snorted, looking very anxious.

From the bushes at the side, rustling sounds could be heard. Two tall warthogs walked out hesitantly with vigilance.

Just as Little Curly Tail's eyes lit up and he was about to pounce on them with his tail wagging, Tilly mimicked Chu Xiaoye and slapped his head to make him behave.

The two strong warthogs immediately lay on the ground and bowed respectfully to Chu Xiaoye. Little Curly Tail and the other members of the pride of the cold father were dumbfounded.

At this moment, two more round figures ran out, as if they were rolling on the ground.

They had black and white fur and dark circles under their eyes. They looked stupid and adorable. They were the cute violent bear mother and son pair.
