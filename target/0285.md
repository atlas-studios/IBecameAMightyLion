Chapter 285: The Changes of the Cold Father

"Roar\!"

The cold father's roar sounded helplessly.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and walked towards the distant river, not looking back at him.

The cold father stood there alone. His initial anger gradually calmed down.

He turned around and walked in front of the lions, continuing to lead them to hunt on the grassland.

The evening sun was blooming with its last light on the horizon, dying half the sky red and leaving behind the most beautiful color.

The river was sparkling.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the river, drinking water as he thought about the migration of the pride.

In this situation, it seemed that they could not migrate for the time being.

If the cold father was unwilling to leave, the female lions would probably not leave either.

When they finished drinking and walked up the hill, many herbivores came to the river in groups and prepared to drink water.

At this moment, the cold father also brought the lions and hid in the grass on the hill, preparing to ambush the herbivores who were drinking water.

Once these herbivores walked down the hill and faced the river, it would be difficult for them to escape.

Here, there were no other carnivores competing.

Chu Xiaoye knew that their chances of success would be much higher this time. However, it was still difficult to make every member full.

Even though the lions were old, their appetites were still astonishing.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and did not stop. He left with the pride.

The cold father lay in the grass and looked at their backs. He was in a daze and seemed a little distracted.

That was his pride.

He could have lived a carefree life in his pride.

However, he was here now, hunting arduously for this group of old lions.

When did the always cold and heartless him become like this?

"It's all because of those two unfilial sons\!"

The cold father suddenly thought of the reason.

Ever since that unfilial son started to become powerful, there was no longer a chance for him to show off his might as a lion king in the pride. He was even abused from time to time.

He was a dignified lion king and was in his prime. He naturally did not want to tremble in fear all day and do nothing.

Although it was a little difficult to lead this group of old lions, he could enjoy their respectful gazes and enjoy the might a true lion king should have. This was the true life of a lion\!

A lion's life should be exciting\!

If he lived under the shadow of his children forever, he might as well die sooner\!

He would rather starve to death, die of exhaustion, and die in battle than lower his voice and struggle at death's door in the pride while trembling in fear\!

He wanted to be a true lion king\!

After dark.

Just as Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and was about to look at the distant grassland from the top of the tree, the cold father lowered his head, held his stomach, and returned unhappily.

He was hungry and could not take it anymore.

In the evening.

They did catch prey by the river, but they only caught two antelopes.

Before he could start eating, the two prey were torn to pieces by the old lions whose eyes had long turned green from hunger. They wolfed down the food.

He drank a stomach full of river water, but he was even hungrier. He tossed and turned on the grass for a while. He could not take it anymore and could only put down his dignity and return in a sorry state.

Looking at his weak and dejected expression, Chu Xiaoye knew that he regretted it.

His momentary impulse was exchanged for a long time of torture.

The always cold and heartless him suddenly became gentle today. He originally thought that he would become a hero and return under the attention of everyone, but he realized that reality was so cruel.

How could it be easy to change the rules of the pride that persisted to this day?

Those who grew old and became useless would eventually be eliminated.

No one was an exception.

Perhaps, when he saw the old lions today, he thought of his future.

No matter how glorious the old lion king was in the past, in the end, he could only die alone and miserably.

No one would pity them.

The cold father stood outside the bushes and looked at every member who was resting with a complicated and disappointed gaze.

Mei Mei walked out of the bushes with a gazelle in her mouth. She placed the prey in front of him and left.

"Nice\!"

The cold father no longer cared about his dignity and image and immediately started biting.

After he finished eating and drinking, he left again and walked towards the territory of the elderly lions.

He still could not let go of them.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and looked at his retreating figure. He suddenly felt that this father had gradually become someone he did not know.

He was not the only one who had changed. All the members were changing.

Was it his influence, or did that mutation make them more emotional and emotional?

Under the tree.

Little Curly Tail was bullying Molly again while he was thinking about something.

That kid used his tail to trip Molly on the ground, making her eat a mouthful of mud and even jumped onto Molly's back, stepping hard a few times.

Mei Mei ran over angrily.

Little Curly Tail did not accept the challenge and turned to run. He grinned foolishly and was pleased with himself. He had a smug look that seemed to be saying that they were idiots and were born to be bullied by him.

"Idiot\!"

Chu Xiaoye cursed inwardly as he expected better from him.

How could there be such a stupid male in this world?

He did not deserve a large harem\!

"Whoosh\!"

A white figure suddenly jumped out of the forest and landed in front of him. She blinked her big round eyes and looked at him pitifully, begging him to bring her to drink water.

"I'm thirsty, so thirstyâ€¦"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws and slapped her, telling her to scram and not in front of him.

He was standing on the tree now, looking at the distant grassland and guarding against the enemy. He was not enjoying the scenery in his free time. He did not have the time to drink water with this female cub.

Tilly covered her head and glared at him. She swung her claws and slapped him on the head too. Then, she turned around and jumped away. She landed on a big tree in the distance and looked at him provocatively.

"Smelly fart king\! Come on, chase me\! If you have the ability, catch up to me\!"

Chu Xiaoye glared at her and ignored her. He treated her as a fart and let her go. He looked at the distant grassland again with a serious expression.

Tilly immediately felt bored and could only jump away to find the Belita sisters to play.

Aisha lay in the grass under the tree and sighed when she saw this scene.

The night grew darker.

After the cold father came to the new territory, he divided the elderly lions into a few teams to take turns to patrol and stand guard, always paying attention to the alarm in the territory ahead.

Although they did not have much combat strength, their roars were still loud. If an enemy attacked, they could immediately inform the other members.

After the distribution, the cold father stayed in this territory for a while and felt bored.

They were all men and old lions. They had nothing in common. Even if he wanted to show off his two unfilial sons and brag for a while, there were no listeners. Everyone yawned and was sleepy.

The cold father was bored and could only get up to leave.

After eating and drinking his fill, he was in good spirits. He could not be bothered to go back and suffer the anger of those two unfilial sons. He decided to walk around the surrounding territory and see what his eldest son, Lars, was doing.

However, just as he walked out of the territory, he saw a black shadow appear on the hill not far away.

The black shadow seemed to have just climbed up from the river at the foot of the hill. It was dripping wet. As soon as it came up, it raised its head and looked around vigilantly.

Behind it, more black figures climbed up from the foot of the hill.

They were actually a group of agile black female lions\!

The cold father was shocked when he saw this scene. Just as he was about to roar, a black shadow suddenly jumped out from the grass beside him. With a whoosh, it pounced at him\!
