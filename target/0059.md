Chapter 59: The Lion's Invasion

It was dangerous by the river.

The hot weather, lack of food, and decreasing water sources made all the animals' tempers become even more violent.

The hippopotamuses that had migrated from the downstream were bullying the crocodiles again.

To occupy more river water, the hippopotamus group, under the lead of the leader, started to attack the crocodiles.

The originally muddy river water was now covered in mud and chaos.

The crocodiles had no choice but to swallow their anger again and continue to move upstream, giving the hippopotamuses more territory.

However, with the arrival of the dry season and the continued decline of the river, war would erupt again sooner or later.

In order to survive, the crocodiles had no choice but to defend the last stretch of water.

By the river.

A few zebras also fought for positions to drink water.

Their combat weapons were their strong hind legs and mouths. Other than kicking, they were biting the other party's legs.

Many zebras died because their legs were bitten in the battle with their own kind and they could not run. Hence, carnivores took the opportunity to kill them.

Competition would always be there.

No one knew if the two strong male gazelles were fighting for territory or their mates, but they started fighting directly by the river full of carnivores.

Their tempers were especially violent. Every time they dashed forward and collided, they would put in their all and cause dust to fly.

The thin and sharp horns on their heads let out crisp sounds of collision and friction.

They were very unlucky.

In a fierce collision, the two slender horns actually locked together and could not be separated anymore.

The two gazelles stood in place with their heads lowered. They retreated and went forward. They paced back and forth anxiously, but there was nothing they could do.

At this moment, a few wandering hyenas saw an opportunity and ran over.

They did not hesitate and immediately pounced behind a gazelle, starting to bite ferociously.

The gazelle wanted to escape, but it could not move.

As for the other gazelle, it could only glare in fear. It lowered its head and retreated with all its might.

The hyenas bit as they moved with them.

Before long, the gazelle was eaten until only its head and half of its neck were left\!

As for the other gazelle, it finally raised its head and ran away with its companion's bloody head.

The hyenas that were full did not chase after him.

They looked at the three female lions and the four young cubs by the river.

Chu Xiaoye drank the water and turned around to look at them.

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs and let out a fierce roar. He looked at them provocatively and disdainfully.

The hyenas looked at him and turned to leave.

They had too few members and were not enough to pose a threat to these lionesses and young cubs.

They had wandered over from elsewhere and were trying to join the hyenas in this territory.

At that time, he would come and get to know these old enemies.

The ferocious underwater killers had already been chased up by the hippopotamuses. The place where the lions drank water was now occupied by the hippopotamuses.

Under normal circumstances, these huge monsters that even crocodiles feared would not attack lions.

Therefore, Aisha and Xi'er drank peacefully with the cubs.

Chu Xiaoye could clearly feel the fatigue of the three female lions and the worry in their eyes.

At their age, they had naturally survived many dry seasons.

The dry season was undoubtedly the most difficult and dangerous season of life for the animals on the grassland.

To cubs, it was even crueler.

Many young cubs would die of hunger or thirst during the dry season.

They did not have the endurance and stamina of an adult lion, and could not travel too far or fight against an adult lion.

Many a time, even if the female lions caught prey, they would not be able to eat it.

When there was a lack of food, be it lionesses or lions, out of their animal instincts, they would only fill their stomachs and let themselves live.

Therefore, when they felt that the dry season was approaching and the cruel and heartless might of nature was about to descend on the grassland, the three female lions' mood was exceptionally heavy and anxious.

If the pride was strong enough, they could leave their territory and continue to migrate upwards with the river.

However, their pride was not strong.

More powerful prides lived upstream. If they dared to enter their territory and snatch their food and resources, they would pay a heavy price.

In fact, it might even be a disaster\!

Therefore, they could only stay here for the time being.

Perhaps, this dry season was not long.

They could still make it through if they persisted for a while.

With this thought in mind, the three female lions drank the water and left with the young cubs.

Chu Xiaoye had a gnu bladder full of water in his mouth.

He would not leave it to fate, nor would he wait foolishly, or pray for the mercy of heaven and nature.

He had to use his own way to survive.

Aisha looked at the thing in his mouth. Although it was strange, she did not stop him.

She thought that this son was just playful.

As for Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, they did not understand their brother's actions.

What was so fun about this? He had something in his mouth and could not even scream. It was not fun at all.

However, they would support whatever his brother did.

As for Catherine, who was following behind, she was still secretly looking at the hero in her heart with admiration.

Even though at this moment, her hero was playing with his prey's urine bag in his mouth.

"Roar—"

Just as they walked up the hill, the roar of two lions suddenly came from the grassland not far from the lion's camp\!

A wandering lion had invaded\!

The cold father ran over and prepared to fight\!

Lars and the pregnant Callie and Maya also ran after them.

They did not go to help. Instead, they stopped on the grassland and watched nervously.

Aisha immediately ran over with the two female lions and the four young cubs.

The battle of the two lions concerned the survival of the cubs in the pride.

The cold father did not seem to have eaten anything for the past two days. If he lost because of his stamina, the entire pride would face the most terrifying change\!

Chu Xiaoye held a water bag in his mouth and followed behind the three female lions with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei. He complained in his heart.

Saliva flowed from the corner of his mouth, but he could not put down the water bag in his mouth.

Without both hands, it was troublesome to take something.

He followed his mother and stopped in his tracks. He raised his head and looked at the grassland not far away.

A wandering lion with a lush mane and black hair was roaring at the cold father provocatively.

From the color of his mane, she could tell that he was in the strong phase and his male hormones were extremely vigorous. His strength could not be underestimated.

The cold father's gaze was grave. He bared his fangs and let out an angry and fierce roar. He pounced forward without hesitation\!

The dry season was approaching.

He must not lose his territory and pride\!

Otherwise, what awaited him was only death\!

The five female lions stood in place and looked nervously at his brave figure.

Be it the children, Aisha and the others, or the pregnant Callie and Maya, they were all terrified and uneasy.

Whether their children could be saved depended on whether their king could successfully defeat the invaders.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the battle between the two lions with a burning gaze, then turned around to look at Lars.

Lars did not react.

His eyes were filled with fear and panic, as if he was waiting for his fate to be decided.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye let go of the water bag in his mouth and turned his head to look at Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei beside him.

The two little fellows were stunned at first, but then they immediately understood what he meant.

"Roar—"

They let out brave roars.

This was the horn of battle\!

Aisha and Xi'er, who were standing at the side, were shocked. They turned around and looked at them in shock.
