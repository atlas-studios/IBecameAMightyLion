Chapter 417: Untitled

Two fists could not defeat four hands.

The young lion king with a sparse mane finally fell to the ground and could not stand up again.

His spine was bitten off and his abdomen was bitten through. Even his brain was bitten through. His entire body was covered in wounds. There was not a single intact piece of flesh on his entire body.

His fantasy of fighting alone turned into a group fight.

He widened his eyes and died with a grievance.

The battle of the two prides made the little animals and birds around flee in panic. It also attracted the attention of the other ferocious beasts in this ancient forest.

However, when the ferocious beasts checked carefully from afar, they quietly left.

This group of outsiders did not seem to be easy to provoke.

Although the big black bear's terrifying roar was a little fierce on the outside, it could indeed scare most enemies.

Blue eyes, Mixed Fur, and the size and aura of the Jerry brothers also made most animals retreat.

However, there would still be some animals that were very interested in them.

For example, their old enemy, the hyenas.

The hyenas seemed to be the same reason why the pride appeared here. They were forced to leave their homes and were wandering around.

The hyenas' front and back legs were different in length. They could run on the grassland to hunt, but in this forest where bushes grew, it was difficult.

They were not good at hiding and ambushing, let alone running here.

Therefore, they would try their best to eat food and would not be picky, nor would they give up on any corpse easily, even if they had a head-on conflict with the pride.

They heard the sounds of fighting in the pride and smelled the strong smell of blood. They knew that a sumptuous meal was waiting for them here.

They formed groups, shook their heads and wagged their tails, and rushed over excitedly.

In the dark night, pairs of cold eyes lit up and soon covered the entire forest here.

This was a super hyena pack with more than a hundred hyenas\!

They did not let out noisy cries like usual to threaten the enemy. Instead, they lined up and approached silently.

The hyena queen mixed in the hyenas and hid herself. No one could see where she was.

In the battle between the pride and the hyenas, almost every lion king could easily find the hyena queen in the hyena pack and chase after her.

This time, even if Chu Xiaoye was here, it would probably be difficult to discover him at a glance.

The hyenas were almost identical in size. They had mutated and became exceptionally tall and mighty. They were even larger than the cold father.

Under normal circumstances, female spotted hyenas were larger than male spotted hyenas, but now, they had become the same size.

Furthermore, the spots on the hyenas' bodies also changed. They turned from the original brown spots to slightly red spots, like drops of dizzy blood that were dotted on them.

The moonlight landed on it, looking extremely demonic.

This huge hyena pack did not hesitate at all and started to surround the pride hundreds of meters away.

They seemed to be quite confident in themselves. Furthermore, they seemed to want to kill this pride that had just won\!

They were already hungry.

Lions were also their prey\!

"Roarâ€”"

The roar of Blue Eyes suddenly sounded in the quiet night.

Before all the members of the pride could enjoy the joy of victory, they tensed up again with this roar and waited solemnly.

In the surrounding darkness, many ghost-like eyes lit up.

The hyenas surrounded him silently.

The cold father, who had not had his fill in the battle just now, was very excited when he heard the Blue Eyes' alarm. However, when he saw such a huge hyena pack, he immediately felt that something was wrong.

Furthermore, the hyenas were too big, even larger than him\!

Fear appeared in Aisha, Xi'er, and Maya's eyes.

Even in their former grassland, female lions like them were very afraid of hyenas. Furthermore, they were facing such a huge and strong hyena pack\!

Pit immediately roared and crawled into the hole. Then, it stuck out its head and called out to the panicked Qiqi and Nunu.

The two young cubs hurriedly left their mothers and crawled into the cave.

However, in front of the hyenas, the cave was not safe.

Because hyenas also knew how to dig holes and were very good at digging holes. Their cubs were usually hidden in holes.

In the pride camp, only the members of the pride of the cold father were left, as well as Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers.

The Jiela sisters, the six female lions, and the Chino brothers left with Chu Xiaoye.

The four members of Blue's family had always been alone, be it resting or hunting. Now, they were nowhere to be seen.

As for Pit and the other two warthogs, although they were very strong and dared to resist a lion, they were not too useful against so many hyenas.

As for the cute violent bear and her son, no one knew where they went.

The tallest and strongest black bear in the team started to bare its fangs and brandish its claws again, letting out a terrifying roar.

However, its steps were quietly retreating.

Its agile little eyes rolled in their sockets, looking around secretly, as if it was looking for the best escape route.

The little girl was originally sleeping, but she was forcefully thrown onto its back.

Even in this crisis, it still would not abandon this human little girl it had just known.

The lioness named Alisa suddenly disappeared.

The roar of Blue Eyes traveled far into the quiet night.

At that time, Chu Xiaoye was leading the team to hunt a group of giraffes.

No one knew why the giraffes came to this forest. Furthermore, not only were they taller and stronger, they had also learned to jump. They jumped like antelopes and gazelles, running in the forest as if they were flying. It was rather magical\!

However, in front of Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail, and the others, they still could not escape.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to kill with the hunters, the roar of Blue Eyes was heard.

The panicked giraffes finally survived.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and hurriedly returned.

He jumped onto the tree and sprayed air behind him. In the blink of an eye, he left Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and the others far behind.

When the spotted hyenas attacked the pride, Chu Xiaoye arrived.

However, he hid on the tree and was not in a hurry to show himself.

Among the more than 100 spotted hyenas, there would always be a few standing in the distance slacking or commanding.

The silence was broken and the hyenas' noisy cries were ear-piercing.

The hyena queen still had not appeared.

Chu Xiaoye hid on the tree, his eyes flickering with a golden light. As he observed the hyenas, he paid attention to his team members.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and the cute violent bear and her son, who had suddenly rushed back from the distant forest, formed a circle, surrounding the cave on the ground and the cold father and the female lions.

The cold father looked a little sullen. He tried his best to squeeze out and fight, but he could not get out.

As for the big black bear, it leaned against a big tree at the side and bared its fangs. It kept letting out deafening roars, preventing the spotted hyenas from approaching.

The little girl was terrified as she rode on its back, but she was very safe.

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye felt a pair of eyes shaking on a big tree in front of him. He looked up and saw that it was actually the male leopard, Blue.

Blue had long hidden there and was squinting like him, observing the hyenas below carefully, looking for the hyena queen.

On a branch not far from Blue, the female leopard was hiding with Belita.

As for Belia, no one knew where she went.

Chu Xiaoye searched for a while on a nearby tree and did not find the female leopard. Just as he was about to look down at the battle below, a head suddenly stuck out from the dense leaves at the side and rubbed his butt gently.

It was still that familiar scent of heat.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to move.
