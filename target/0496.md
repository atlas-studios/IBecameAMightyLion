Chapter 496: Night Slaughter

It was like a dream.

Even when he woke up, he was in a daze and did not know what to do.

After dawn.

Chu Xiaoye turned back into a bald lion.

The morning sun shone on the green vines climbing and the flower-filled garden. It was warm.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the soft grass, doubting the life of a lion in a daze.

Catherine lay at the side and looked at him quietly, as if nothing that happened to him was worth making a fuss about, let alone change her heart for him.

Annie and Vilis entered the palace again.

Before leaving, the huge sword elf with a cold expression had been gripping the hilt tightly and repeating the words "compensate the door."

When Chu Xiaoye raised her sword and cut her door in half last night, she took this matter to heart and kept warning him to compensate the door. Furthermore, she said in a serious manner, "This door is an heirloom of my Slaughter Clan and was personally created by my ancestor. Its value is not something that can be estimated with money. Even my castle cannot compare to it\!"

However, when Annie carefully asked her how to compensate, she did not say a word and looked elsewhere, as if she was doing as she pleased.

"Then I'll apologize to you."

Annie apologized sincerely on behalf of her king.

However, the giant sword fairy did not let the matter rest. She still said coldly, "Compensate me the door\!"

It did not seem to be a happy trip to the palace to see the queen.

They returned before noon.

Annie frowned, looking worried.

Vilis was also frowning.

However, when he saw Chu Xiaoye, the giant sword elf still did not forget to remind him coldly, "Compensate me the door\!"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her.

He was rather conflicted now.

He was actually faintly anticipating the arrival of the night so that he could become an elf.

As a lion king that had once shaken the grassland, this was shameful. It made him feel uneasy and ashamed.

"Vilis, what should we do? Should we go?"

Seeing that she was still pestering Chu Xiaoye about the door, Annie could only sigh and change the topic.

When he was in the palace today, he encountered the elf named Lori.

Regarding what happened here yesterday, the elven knight with many honors shamelessly played the blame and complained to the queen that they had instructed the two lions to kill Baron Olis and the palace guards.

Towards the Queen's questioning, Vilis naturally argued. She said that the other party trespassed her residence without her permission and tried to kill her mount and servant.

Vilis even said, "Your Majesty, if not for my brave mount fighting with its life, Baron Olis would have probably robbed the ancient castle you gave me long ago\!"

Breaking in without the owner's permission was no different from a robber.

The deaths of Olis and the two palace guards were reasonable and there was nothing to pursue.

If they really wanted to pursue the matter, they naturally had to pursue Lori's responsibility.

The queen asked what had happened and comforted Vilis. Then, she reprimanded Lori for her rashness and rudeness very severely, making Lori apologize to Vilis on the spot.

Lori apologized obediently, but she suddenly said to the queen, "Your Majesty, according to what I know, those two lions are not Lady Vilis' mounts and have yet to sign a contract with her. To be able to kill an elf baron and two palace guards, those two lions are clearly extraordinary. There are still a few princesses and princes in the palace who do not have mounts and battle beasts. Why don't we bring the two lions into the palace and let them show their strength in front of Your Majesty so that the princesses and princes can choose."

Vilis immediately rejected and said with certainty, "I'm about to sign a contract with them\!"

However, the Queen was clearly tempted.

Lori was good at reading expressions. She immediately smiled and said, "Lady Vilis, you have two lions there. If you really can't bear to give them to the princesses and princes, just give one."

He was deliberately trying to sow discord between Vilis, the princesses, princes, and even Her Majesty.

Vilis still rejected coldly.

Annie could not help but whisper, "Lord Lori, the two lions have always been together. They won't be apart."

Lori looked at her disdainfully and said rudely, "Is there a place for an impostor like you to talk here? Shut your mouth\!"

Facing the insult of this elf, the dignified gaze of the queen, and the gazes of the other elven nobles, Annie did not dare to speak again.

The Queen was silent for a while before she looked at Vilis and smiled amiably. "It's just two lions. Vilis, since they're both quite strong, bring them into the palace and let everyone broaden their horizons. If you really like them and are unwilling to give them up, it's up to you. I won't force you."

The other elven nobles and ministers echoed, wanting to see the two lions that had killed Olis and the palace guards.

Hence, the matter was decided.

In the evening, the palace held a banquet.

At that time, the elven nobles, ministers, and the royal family would gather and watch the lion's performance.

"Night, I'm sorry…"

Annie did not know what to do and could only apologize.

Who could disobey the Queen's orders?

Vilis tightened her grip on the sword hilt and suddenly looked at Chu Xiaoye. She said with a burning gaze, "Do you dare to go?"

Chu Xiaoye did not answer and continued to lie lazily on the ground.

This was not a question of whether he dared or not, but whether he was willing.

He was a dignified lion king who was free, noble, and proud. Now, he was asked to perform for the elves in the palace. Wasn't this humiliating him?

Furthermore, if he went to the palace in the evening, what if he suddenly turned into an elf in front of everyone?

Vilis seemed to see the worry in his heart and said, "Don't worry, you will only transform at midnight."

"No\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly spoke in human language.

This not only frightened him, but also the others.

Even the experienced and knowledgeable Vilis had never heard of someone speaking from the body of a beast.

Hence, the huge sword fairy looked at him even brighter and said again, "Compensate me my door\!"

Everyone knew the rest. To put it bluntly, this little elf wanted him to compensate her.

Chu Xiaoye naturally did not answer.

"You promised that you would help me fight once."

Vilis suddenly narrowed her eyes and said with a strong voice, "Then, help me fight tonight\!"

This battle was not just a performance. It was a competition and competition between the various forces. Not only them, the other nobles and factions would also take out their battle beasts to compete and might even fight personally.

This concerned their honor\!

"Tonight, you are the Slaughter Clan's, Vilis Slaughter's warbeast\! Your name is—Night Slaughter\!"
