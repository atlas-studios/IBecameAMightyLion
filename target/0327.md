Chapter 327: Black Python and Old Turtle

The snake meat was very delicious.

Chu Xiaoye took a few bites and realized that the dead python was still twitching and would occasionally curl up. It should be that the nerves in its muscles had yet to die completely.

Just as he lowered his head and was about to bite again, a big bump suddenly bulged on the bloody wound.

Then, with a puff, blood splashed and a triangular head popped out. It was actually a ferocious and black python\!

The little python quickly crawled out of the bloody hole and fled into the lake in panic.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked.

Right at this moment, another one actually crawled out from the wound\!

Then, more small pythons crawled out of the bloody hole. They were densely packed and quickly fled into the lake.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine, who were eating the other parts of the python, retreated in fear and watched this scene in shock.

More pythons crawled out\!

A black mass quickly crawled towards the lake, looking terrifying\!

"Ugh —"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly spat out the fresh meat he had just eaten.

This was a pregnant female snake\!

Little Curly Tail suddenly rushed up and opened his mouth to bite. He ate the fleeing little pythons with his mouth full of blood and enjoyed it.

Chu Xiaoye's stomach twitched when he saw this. He hurriedly turned around and walked into the forest.

Tilly had already fled into the forest and was hiding in the bushes, vomiting and trembling.

There were so many little snakes…

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and looked around. He only relaxed when he saw that no black lions were approaching.

When he turned around, he realized that Catherine was already standing silently behind him like a ghost. She was silent, and her dark eyes actually hid the dark light and were as quiet as the night.

"Ugh —"

Just as their eyes met in a daze, Tilly suddenly jumped up and vomited at him.

Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped away. Just as he was about to raise his claws to slap her, there was a loud bang by the lake. A huge wave flew up and half the lake water almost splashed\!

A huge black python that was more than ten meters long suddenly jumped up from the bottom of the lake. It swept its tail and sent Little Curly Tail, who was eating those small pythons at the shore, into the lake with a bang\!

Under the slap of the python's thick tail, Little Curly Tail was like a fallen leaf that could not resist at all. With a splash, he fell into the lake and disappeared.

"Roar—"

Mei Mei immediately roared angrily on the shore.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly jumped down from the tree and ran away.

Catherine did not fall and followed closely.

Tilly also jumped down from the tree and rushed to the lake.

"Whoosh\!"

The huge waves in the lake churned and water splashed everywhere. The entire lake started to sway violently.

The huge black python swam crazily at the bottom of the lake and slapped it. It was exceptionally furious\!

The fish in the lake panicked and jumped out of the water before landing again.

Some small snakes, small shrimps, and unknown water animals crawled out of the water in panic and climbed ashore to escape.

Chu Xiaoye ran to the lake and instructed Catherine and Mei Mei to wait on the shore. Then, he jumped into the lake without hesitation and sank.

Tilly came to the lake and looked at the python in the lake. She thought of the black snakes and shivered again.

However, she only hesitated for a moment before jumping down.

As long as she did not encounter those ugly, disgusting, and smooth little snakes, she was not afraid.

"Roar—"

Unexpectedly, just as she jumped into the water, her nose was clamped by a small crab that ran up from the bottom of the lake in panic. She immediately let out a scream, jumped up, and fled to the shore in fear, not daring to go down again.

After Chu Xiaoye sank to the bottom of the lake, a stream of air suddenly spewed out from behind him and quickly caught up to the huge black python.

Just as he rushed close, he saw the huge black python swing its tail. A huge wave suddenly surged over and slapped him away.

Then, the lake water around them swayed violently, rolling up one vortex after another\!

Chu Xiaoye was skilled and had a turbine engine supporting him, but he was powerless and helpless. He was like duckweed, swaying left and right in the rolling sea, rising and falling, tossing and turning, completely losing his direction.

However, he finally saw Little Curly Tail.

That kid was using his long tail to wrap tightly around the three inches of the huge black python. No matter how the black python rolled and swayed, he was wrapped tightly there.

The huge black python was anxious and furious. It slapped its body crazily at the bottom of the water. At one moment, it was swimming quickly, at another moment, it was rolling quickly at the bottom of the lake, and at another moment, it was charging left and right and jumping up and down, but it could not shake him off\!

As for the huge black python's thick tail and body, it happened to be unable to wrap around it.

Little Curly Tail was dizzy from its swaying. He wanted to bite and scratch, but his claws and teeth could not use any strength. He was like a water plant wrapped around the neck of the huge black python. He was swayed left and right and was completely confused.

"Pfft—"

A stream of air suddenly spewed out from behind Chu Xiaoye\!

He broke through the surging lake water and quickly fell, landing on a huge rock suddenly. His sharp claws immediately pierced into the rock and he finally stabilized his body.

However, right at this moment, the remaining black rock suddenly swayed and slowly floated up.

Then, a black head popped out from under the rock.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that the thing he was squatting on was not a rock, but a huge old turtle\!

This old turtle's shell was seven to eight meters long. It was covered in mud and moss. He could not see any turtle shell.

It extended its limbs and started to swim towards the huge black python.

Although his speed was slow, he walked straight forward and was not affected by the waves.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on it, his claws tightly gripping the turtle shell. He raised his head and stuck out his chest, his fur flying. He felt like a general sitting on a battleship, majestic, mighty, and domineering\!

"Boom\!"

The huge black python swung its tail crazily and dark currents surged over\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly leaned down and grabbed the turtle shell tightly with his four claws. His fur was standing on end angrily and his handsome face kept changing with the impact of the undercurrents, twisting and ferocious.

The huge old turtle still walked slowly, like a huge rock floating at the bottom of the lake.

When it quietly arrived in front of the huge black python, the old turtle suddenly swung its limbs gently and instantly hit the black python's tail.

Then, the head popped out of the turtle shell with a whoosh and bit the tail of the huge black python. It actually started eating\!

The huge black python immediately felt pain. Its body trembled and its tail swung crazily.

However, its entire body was twisting and swaying. Only its tail did not move\!

The old turtle's huge body floated in the water without moving. It slowly chewed its tail, looking refined and calm, calm and handsome.

He was like a lazy author who controlled everything in this world.
