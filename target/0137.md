Chapter 137: Water of Life

The female lions had never seen such a battle.

Had it already ended when it just started?

Their king did not even have the time to retaliate before he was already lying on the ground unconscious.

Looking at the young and strong male cub in front of them, the three female lions immediately lowered their heads obediently.

The new king replaced the old king.

This was something every pride would experience.

However, they never would have thought that their future king would be this young male cub whose mane had not even appeared.

They stood in place, lowered their eyes, and expressed enough respect and gentleness, preparing to wait for the new king to comfort and rub against them affectionately.

From today onwards, they were family.

As for the loser lying on the ground, from this moment on, he had already lost this territory and the three of them.

He should be expelled or bitten to death by this new king soon.

But.

What happened next exceeded their expectations.

The young new king no longer bothered with the failures lying on the ground, nor did he come over to rub against them. Instead, he turned his head and walked towards the bushes. Then, he lay inside and slept.

The little elephant also followed and started to use its nose to curl the leaves on the bushes and eat.

The three female lions were stunned in place.

Not long after.

The unconscious adult lion slowly woke up.

He raised his head and stared blankly for a while. Then, he looked at the three female lions and asked, "What's wrong with me? Was I asleep or dreaming?"

The three female lions looked at him with complicated gazes and ignored him. Instead, they continued to look at the figure under the bushes.

The adult lion turned its head and followed their gaze. Its entire body trembled and its eyes were filled with fear.

He immediately thought of the battle just now.

This young lion that had ridden an elephant over defeated him with two slaps and knocked him out\!

How humiliating\!

"Roar\!”

He suddenly jumped up and roared\!

He must have been too careless just now, or he had been intimate with these three wives for too long during the day and was a little weak\!

He was a dignified adult lion in his prime, how could he be defeated by a cub that had yet to grow fur\!

Impossible\!

This time, he had to show his might and make the other party scram out of his territory\!

"Roar\!”

He roared and rushed over\!

"Smack\! Smack\!"

Two more slaps.

He crawled on the ground again and blacked out again.

Chu Xiaoye continued to sleep.

The three female lions watched this scene in a daze, frozen in place like stone sculptures.

At midnight.

The adult lion woke up slowly again.

This time, he only crawled on the ground and stared blankly for a while. He secretly turned his head to look at the young figure and closed his eyes again.

The night quickly retreated.

After dawn.

What the three female lions imagined still did not happen.

The young male cub rode on the young elephant and left under the morning sun.

The bushes had already been eaten up and were bare and empty, just like their current mood.

The adult lion, who was lying on the ground pretending to be dead, immediately got up and looked at the distant figure in surprise and confusion.

It seemed that his throne was saved.

Of course, there were also his female lions.

"Roar\!"

He growled excitedly and walked towards the three female lions, preparing to comfort them, who had been frightened the entire night.

However, the three female lions immediately turned around and left coldly.

Without comparison, there would be no harm.

He was young, strong, and could ride a strong food everywhere. He could fill his stomach at any time.

As for him?

Hehe.

He had nowhere to go\!

The torture of the dry season was still ongoing.

Three days later.

Chu Xiaoye, who was walking along the riverbed, finally saw the river at the foot of a winding hill.

The river water stopped flowing here, the main trunk withered, and the branches dried up.

The river water here no longer had any excess energy to flow. Every day, it would evaporate under the hot sun.

Before long, it would disappear too.

However, even this pitiful small pool of water attracted all sorts of animals nearby.

The murky river water that was at risk was the source of their lives.

The reason why they could last until now was because of it.

Here, baboons, monkeys, black antelopes, sand chickens, and some birds were gathered.

Not far away, there were also some jackals, wild dogs, and other carnivores watching covetously.

In the muddy river, there were also a few old crocodiles lying there. They were struggling at death's door while looking for an opportunity to hunt some food.

Even though the herbivores could see the danger in the river, they still carefully went to the river and lowered their heads to drink water.

At this time, which animal on the grassland was not looking for a chance to survive in the cracks?

Survival in danger, the loser eliminated.

Every animal could not avoid it.

If they wanted to live, they had to be brave.

"Whoosh\!"

Suddenly, water splashed everywhere. A crocodile opened its mouth and raised its head from the muddy river. It bit the head of a baboon and dragged it down.

The river water churned and became even muddier.

The other crocodiles immediately gathered and started fighting to tear the baboon that was still struggling and crying out miserably.

As for the other baboons and other animals by the river, they took this opportunity to quickly approach the river and lower their heads.

This was the opportunity that the unlucky baboon had bought for them.

A newborn gazelle was standing behind the gazelle mother in a daze, looking fearfully at the rolling mud and blood in the river.

At this moment, an old baboon that had just finished drinking water suddenly rushed over and bit its neck. Its two claws grabbed its legs and lifted it up.

The gazelle mother, who was drinking water, jumped in fright and turned to run.

The old baboon grabbed the little gazelle's hind legs, spread its arms, and suddenly pulled, tearing open its abdomen, causing it to bleed\!

The little gazelle widened its eyes and cried out miserably.

The old baboon immediately lowered its head and started to drink blood and eat the fresh meat.

Not far away.

A group of wild dogs were surrounding a black antelope that had just finished drinking water and was about to leave.

A jackal was quietly approaching a few birds that were drinking water.

Two thin and weak wandering lions were standing on the hill, waiting for the opportunity to snatch the prey of other carnivores.

Beside a small pool of water, all sorts of battles were happening to survive.

Every animal's eyes were filled with desire for life.

At this moment.

Chu Xiaoye rode on his elephant and broke into this killing ground where animals fought for their lives.

Almost at the same time, all the animals looked at him as well as the mount under him strangely and in shock.
