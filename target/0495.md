Chapter 495: Lions and Elves

It was already late at night.

The moon was bright and the deep and empty castle was silent.

The garden was empty. The corpses and blood on the grass had long disappeared, as if nothing had happened.

In the dark corridor, pale moonlight shone through the window.

On the ground, a black shadow was crawling slowly with its limbs.

In the room, the burning light was flickering and the light was dim. Vilis and Annie were sitting at the table whispering. The big black bear was sleeping soundly in the corner.

Catherine was standing in the shadows at the side, looking at them helplessly.

They always asked her something patiently, but she was confused and could not answer.

A rustling figure suddenly came from the corridor outside the door, as if something was rubbing the ground. It was getting closer and closer, and in the quiet night, it was especially terrifying.

The big black bear, who was sleeping soundly in the corner, suddenly opened its eyes. However, it subconsciously shrank its neck and shivered.

Catherine was in a daze and her mind was in chaos, as if she did not hear this voice.

Vilis stood up and picked up the huge sword beside her. Her gaze was fierce as she walked towards the door step by step.

"Knock\! Knock\! Knock\!"

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

However, the sound came from the bottom of the wooden door.

The pale moonlight shone through the door at the bottom of the door that was crawling on the ground. It was very long and swayed like a ghost.

"Crack\!"

Vilis suddenly pulled open the door and stabbed the huge sword in her hand into the ground in front of her with a clang. The sharp blade splashed a few sparks on the hard green stone slab.

The huge sword protected her petite body. As long as she kicked, the sharp blade would cut forward\!

The cold night wind blew from outside. Vilis' silver hair fluttered as she held the hilt of the huge sword with both hands. Her gaze was like a torch as she shouted without fear, "Who is it?"

She lowered her head and looked at the ground.

The black shadow crawling on the ground raised its head and looked at him with its blue eyes. It looked stupid and suddenly said, "Me."

Of course, when he said the word "me", his body clearly trembled and he looked shocked and in disbelief.

Catherine ran over and smelled the familiar scent on him. She also looked stupid.

"Why are you lying on the ground?"

Vilis put away her huge sword in shock and blinked as she asked.

"I… can speak?"

The black shadow on the ground did not seem to have heard anything. He was still immersed in the word "me" that he suddenly blurted out. He was so shocked that he could not extricate himself.

Vilis rolled her eyes and said with a cold face, "Not only do you know how to talk, you can also stand up and walk. You're an elven knight, how can you crawl on the ground and move?"

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked at her in shock.

Then, he tried to support himself with both hands and legs and slowly stood up.

He really stood up\!

He lowered his head and looked at his hands, legs, body, and everything. He was stunned.

He had become an elf\!

This elf was none other than the elf boy he had killed in the garden in the evening—strictly speaking, it was him\!

When he woke up alone in the dark room just now, he thought that he was already dead.

He crawled out of the room in a daze and crawled along the corridor, thinking that he was still a lion and like a walking corpse without a soul. Then, he crawled here and heard the sounds inside.

"King…"

Annie walked over, her eyes filled with tears. She looked at him with sparkling eyes and said happily, "You're not dead. You killed the true you and merged with his body. From now on, you're you, the only you, the true you. Everything about you is in your palm. No one can take it away easily. You're truly free."

Beside him, Vilis said coldly, "No living species will really be free. Your Highness, I hope this is the last time I remind you that he is not your king and his name is not king."

Annie wiped the tears at the corner of her eyes and smiled gently. She extended her small hand to her king and introduced solemnly, "Night, hello. I'm Annie, Princess Annie. Your friends and companions are also your family and sister."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. He reached out shakily and held her cold little hand.

He lowered his head half a head than Willis and one head more than Annie, like a young and naive little boy, but he was a true elf.

Like Vilis, he did not seem to be tall.

He was still not used to this new body. As he held Annie's soft and tender hand, he trembled and could not help but squeeze it hard, causing Little Annie's expression to change.

Vilis hurriedly opened his hand.

Catherine stood at the side and raised her head, looking at him in a daze. However, her dark eyes were still filled with trust and feelings that had never left.

Chu Xiaoye extended his trembling hand and rubbed her head. He suddenly said, "Where's my body?"

He was stunned for a moment before he repeated, "I mean, where's my original body?"

Catherine lowered her head and rubbed his palm gently with a blank expression.

She did not know how to answer.

In the evening, she saw everything that happened in the garden. However, the scene was too strange for her to describe.

After a moment of silence, Vilis said, "Don't worry, you're still a lion. You can't control the strength in your body yet. You'll change back at dawn."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in shock and said with a trembling voice, "You're saying that… at dawn, I'll return to my original lion appearance, and at night, I'll…"

"That might not be true."

Vilis shook her head with an expressionless face. "You can only change freely when you really control the strength in your body."

Annie said anxiously, "Vilis, then, is Night a lion or an elf now? What will his identity become in the future?"

Vilis shrugged and said, "It depends on him. Any change will change with his mood. If he's willing to be an elf, he's an elf. If he's willing to be a lion, he's naturally a lion."

Annie seemed to not understand fully and looked at her king with sparkling eyes. She muttered, "I hope that he will always be an elf."

Catherine looked up at her coldly.

"Can I… try your sword?"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly reached out with a trembling hand and grabbed the huge sword leaning against the door.

Vilis frowned and hesitated for a moment. She did not stop him and said coldly, "You can't hold it."

She was born with divine strength and needed to use both hands to grab it every time. How could a lion that had just obtained an elf's body move when its hands were trembling?

However, Chu Xiaoye suddenly picked it up with one hand and swung it. With a crack, the wooden door was cut in half.
