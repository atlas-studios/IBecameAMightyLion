Chapter 153: Iron-eating Beast

"Ga —"

Right at this moment, a sharp cry suddenly came from the sky\!

It sounded like the cry of a duck.

However, the clarity and penetration of this cry were not something that a duck could compare to\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly looked up.

Not far away, a dense group of strange birds suddenly flew over. They were all blue-feathered and red-crowned. They were huge and seemed to be the same species as the strange bird on the ground.

After the leading strange bird let out a scream, it immediately spread its wings and brought the army of strange birds to swoop down\!

They looked aggressive and murderous\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He ignored the pain in his body and immediately picked up the strange bird on the ground and rushed towards the forest below\!

The little elephant carried Doya and ran very quickly.

Clearly, Doya, who was sitting on its back was the most dangerous. As long as she was caught by those strange birds, she could only fly.

The small jackal couple even dared to be afraid of vultures, let alone face this flock of strange birds that were even larger than eagles. They hurriedly followed Chu Xiaoye and fled towards the hill below.

The Chino brothers followed at the back.

With their weight, those strange birds could not move them alone.

"Ga—Ga —"

The strange birds screamed and rushed down\!

No one knew if they wanted to take revenge or snatch back their companion's corpse.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly puzzled as he ran with the strange bird's corpse in his mouth.

Were animals so united nowadays?

What species were these strange birds that were so ferocious that they even dared to catch lions?

He had completely lost face as a future lion king.

Therefore, he would never let go of the strange bird's corpse\!

When they fled into the dense forest, the strange birds were still circling and screaming, unwilling to leave.

However, because their wings were too big and they could not move agilely in the forest, they did not dare to land.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in his tracks and ate birds in an open space.

He specifically chose a place with a larger space above so that the strange birds circling the top of the tree could see.

He wanted to let them know that the future lion king was not to be trifled with\!

Especially when the lion king was excreting\!

He tore off the strange bird's wings in one bite, raised his head, and started eating while facing the strange birds above him.

"Ouch—Ouch —"

The strange birds circling above let out even more ear-piercing and rapid cries, looking very angry.

Chu Xiaoye ate the wing pound and gestured for the brothers to eat with him.

The strange bird did not taste too good and was not suitable for his taste.

When the brothers walked over, Chu Xiaoye immediately smelled a strange smell.

He quietly turned around and walked into the distance.

From the looks of it, the lion king image that he had reconstructed along the way had probably quietly collapsed.

These fellows were probably laughing at him in their hearts.

It was okay.

He would take back what he had lost\!

On the grassland in the distance, the fiery red setting sun dyed the clouds and half the sky red.

The air was no longer as hot as before. Instead, it was filled with a cool feeling that made him feel relaxed.

This was his heaven\!

He had to fight for it\!

After the strange bird's corpse was eaten, they continued to set off.

After dark.

They came to the forest at the mountainside.

The trees here were ancient and thick. Their crowns were like clouds that covered the sky.

A humid aura filled the forest.

The ground was covered with a thick layer of fallen leaves. It was soft and comfortable to walk on.

When they walked down the hill, they suddenly heard a roar in front of them.

Not long after, an extremely spectacular and beautiful waterfall appeared in his vision\!

Bright moonlight shone through the gaps in the leaves. The silver stream that flowed down created countless splashes and flickered with light.

In Chu Xiaoye's eyes, everything in the night was so clear and bright.

The little elephant stood beside him and was surprisingly quiet.

She seemed to be stunned by the spectacular scene in front of her.

There was no waterfall on the grassland. In its entire life, this was the first time it had seen such a beautiful water scene where water fell from a high place and bloomed magnificently.

The Chino brothers stood at the side and watched this scene in a daze.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the male jackal beside him suddenly lowered its head and called out to the pool under the waterfall.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and was stunned at first. Then, he suddenly widened his eyes in disbelief\!

Beside the pool below, two black figures were squatting. Their fur was black and white, one big and one small. On a careful look, they were actually two furry pandas\!

He thought that he had seen wrongly and hurriedly walked down for a distance. He stretched his neck and looked carefully again.

He was even more certain now.

The two figures, one big and one small, were indeed the iron-eating beasts of the ancient times—pandas\!

The pandas seemed to be a mother and son pair. At this moment, they were squatting on a rock beside the pool and looking eagerly at the splashing water in the pool.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was shocked, the panda actually jumped up with a whoosh and pounced towards the pool\!

He was extremely agile\!

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere and the panda sank into the water and disappeared.

The little panda, who was squatting on the rock, immediately became anxious.

It stood up and paced by the pool, looking at a loss.

Suddenly, a head popped out from the water.

The panda got up from the water with a whoosh and was actually holding a silver-white fish half a meter long in its mouth\!

The little panda was excited.

"Pada\!"

The panda threw the big fish on the rock.

The big fish swung its body violently and wanted to escape into the water again.

The little panda immediately pounced forward and pressed down with its two claws. Then, it opened its mouth and bit\!

Chu Xiaoye was dumbfounded.

Although pandas were omnivores, he had never heard of them sinking into the water to catch fish.

Furthermore, the panda mother was too agile just now. She was completely different from the lazy fellows he had seen in the past\!

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the howl of a wolf suddenly sounded from the forest on the other side of the pool\!

Then, a white wolf that was as strong as a hyena walked out of the forest quickly. Its dark eyes flickered with an icy cold light.

Then, another four to five white wolves walked out of the forest behind it.

When the panda mother saw this, she immediately turned her head and prepared to escape with the panda cub.

At this moment, another five to six white wolves suddenly walked out from the forest behind it. Every white wolf was surprisingly strong and tall.

And downstream, a group of white wolves surrounded them.

This group of white wolves seemed to have ambushed here long ago, waiting specifically for the panda mother and son pair.

Although the panda cub was afraid, it did not seem to be willing to stop eating the delicious food in its mouth. It was still wolfing down the big silver fish.

As for the panda mother, her front legs suddenly left the ground and she stood up. Like an angry brown bear, she let out a roar, revealing two rows of sharp teeth\!

The white wolves seemed to be a little afraid, but they were not prepared to give up.

They started to shrink the encirclement.
