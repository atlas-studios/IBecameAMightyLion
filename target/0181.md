Chapter 181: The Infatuated Lioness Cub

Night fell.

A loud and long eagle's cry suddenly came from the sky.

Then, the birds circling in the sky immediately spread their wings and flew up, leaving the grassland and flying towards the distant majestic snow mountain that was close to the sea.

The 33 beast tribes, who were quietly waiting in place, immediately dispersed as if they had heard a signal and turned to return.

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the back of the little elephant and looked at the beast pack that automatically dispersed. He then turned around and looked at the distant snow mountain, his heart filled with doubts.

This gathering seemed to be to choose those animal leaders to follow the ten-over white lions to the snow mountain.

However, why was this happening?

What were they going to do?

Why did they listen to those white lions?

The behavior of carnivores was understandable.

After all, the strong were respected. Lions were the kings of the grassland, let alone such huge lions. If they were disobedient, those carnivores would probably find it difficult to stay in this grassland.

However, what about those herbivores?

Like elephants, rhinoceroses, and even rabbits followed obediently. What was going on?

They were mortal enemies.

Chu Xiaoye could not understand no matter how hard he thought. He could only ride the elephant and continue to think hard.

Right\!

Unless they had a common enemy that threatened all the animals on this grassland\!

Therefore, be it carnivores or herbivores, they had to work together and resist the enemy under the lead of those powerful white lions\!

Because it concerned their survival, they could forget their past and temporarily form an alliance\!

Chu Xiaoye felt that this idea was very plausible.

However, who would be their common enemy?

Right at this moment, the elephants beside him suddenly raised their noses and let out angry rumbling noises.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the Chino brothers had followed him.

Without him by their side, the two brothers looked at the vast beast pack beside them and immediately felt their limbs go limp in fear, not knowing what to do.

They were all in groups and surrounded by their companions. There were only the two of them, and they were all alone. How could they not be afraid?

When they came to the elephant herd and looked at this group of huge and strong elephants, they trembled in fear. They did not dare to approach, but they did not dare to leave either. They could only look pitifully at Chu Xiaoye, who was on the elephant's back.

They were really two cowards\!

Chu Xiaoye glanced at them angrily and patted the little elephant's ear with his claws, signaling it to help explain to the elephant beside him.

Every animal had their own way of communicating.

The little elephant shook its big ears, swung its nose, and looked at him sideways, as if it was saying, "Fart\!"

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He could only jump down and hit its nose again.

The little elephant sniffed with an intoxicated expression as it let out rumbling sounds. It said to the elephants beside it, "Everyone, don't be nervous. Those two idiots are my brothers' underlings. I can flip them over with my nose\!"

Indeed, once the cries stopped, the elephants lowered their noses and ignored the Chino brothers.

The Chino brothers lowered their heads respectfully. When they walked over, they hurriedly followed behind, but they did not dare to follow too closely, afraid that they would be trampled to death.

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the elephant's back and continued to think.

When they came to the river again, there was no sign of the crocodiles in the river.

Some parts of the river were filled with protruding rocks, and some small animals jumped over from there.

The little elephant followed the elephant herd and waded through the water.

Even if there were crocodiles ambushing them, they would not dare to attack even if they had a few more guts.

When they were about to reach Chu Xiaoye's territory, the little elephant left with the elephant herd. It looked like it was unwilling to leave and wanted Chu Xiaoye to give it another cigarette.

Chu Xiaoye ignored it and returned to the territory with the Chino brothers.

His imagination ran wild the entire way. When he returned to his territory, he pulled himself together.

That absurdity and bizarreness temporarily had nothing to do with him.

He only cared about consolidating his territory and his position as the feudal lord. After everything was ready, he would go back and fetch Little Curly Tail and the others.

Although this place did not look safe, at least he did not have to worry about food and drink. It was much better than there.

Something that could be resolved with battle was generally not a problem for him. It was much easier to deal with than cruel nature, right?

On the grass near the bushes, there was a group of black antelopes eating grass.

Chu Xiaoye brought the Chino brothers and used the dense grass to hide in front of them. Then, he suddenly jumped up and pounced over\!

He bit the neck of a black antelope.

As for the Chino brothers, they were chasing after the fleeing black antelopes.

Obviously, with their speed and endurance, they could not catch up to those strong and powerful jumping experts.

Chu Xiaoye bit the black antelope and walked into the bushes to eat in the grass.

After eating and drinking his fill, he climbed up the tall Baobab tree, found a dense branch, and lay down to rest.

After running around for the night, it was time to rest.

Tomorrow, he planned to visit his neighbors and see how they treated him, the new lion king.

At the same time, he wanted to see the competitors on the surrounding grassland.

If their strength was not too ridiculous, he should consider looking for a few loyal subordinates or lionesses to manage the territory.

After everything was done, he could leave in peace.

Thinking of things, he unconsciously closed his eyes.

After an unknown period of time, roars and noisy cries suddenly sounded in his ears.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the grassland outside the bushes.

Those dark and bright eyes were like ghost flames in the night, floating densely on the entire grassland.

They were a group of spotted hyenas\!

Among the noisy cries of the spotted hyenas was the roar of leopards.

Chu Xiaoye heard the little leopard's voice and her family's voice.

Clearly, just as the family of four was about to return to the bushes, they were suddenly ambushed and surrounded by the hyenas.

Without the trees, they lost their natural advantage and their combat strength was greatly reduced.

From their dark eyes, the number of hyenas was unprecedented\!

Chu Xiaoye counted and saw that there were at least thirty of them.

The hyenas should have returned with the herd.

However, under normal circumstances, they would not hunt leopards. Now that they had suddenly mobilized in groups and surrounded the four leopards on a large scale, could it be that the two sides had already formed hatred previously?

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment, but still climbed down the tree and walked over.

Other animals could hunt in his territory, but not spotted hyenas\!

Not to mention that the hyenas and lions were eternal enemies, the few young cubs in the pride of the cold father had died under the sharp teeth of the hyenas. Therefore, he hated this group of cruel and despicable things and would never allow them to be impudent in his territory\!

Every pride probably could not tolerate these old enemies\!

The hyenas ignored the smell left behind at the border and trespassed his territory so boldly. They were too arrogant and did not take him seriously\!

How could he tolerate this\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and rushed over\!

The hyenas that were attacking the leopard family immediately stopped and turned to look at him.

When they saw that it was only him, the hyenas were clearly stunned. Then, five spotted hyenas came out to face him.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

The two hyenas at the front fell to the ground and cried out miserably.

The remaining three hyenas were shocked. Just as they stopped in their tracks, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed up. He waved his claws and ran like the wind. Before they could react, they fell into a pool of blood\!

At this moment, the hyenas surrounding the leopard family woke up and immediately rushed up\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and felt a little strange.

These spotted hyenas had surrounded the four leopards for a long time. Why did they give up just like that? Was it because he was a greater threat?

Furthermore, there seemed to be no hyena queen in this pack.

Although Chu Xiaoye was puzzled, he did not dare to think too much. He immediately turned around and fled into the bushes.

More than thirty strong hyenas surged forward. No matter how powerful he was, it was impossible for him to be unharmed while killing enemies on this flat grassland.

The hyenas' bite strength was astonishing. No matter where they bit, the pain was unbearable.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to lure them into the bushes and use the advantage of the terrain to catch them all in one fell swoop\!

Since they dared to behave atrociously in his territory, he naturally would not show mercy\!

When he ran towards the bushes, the hyenas chased after him without hesitation.

Belita and her family took this opportunity to follow behind and run towards the bushes.

As long as they reached a place with trees, they would be safe.

With the strength of the male leopard, he could defeat the hyenas in the forest without needing to protect them\!

However, he was already injured in the battle just now and clearly could not fight anymore.

Chu Xiaoye ran into the bushes and looked back at the pursuing hyenas. A cold glint flashed in his eyes, and then he continued to run deeper into the bushes.

He wanted to lure this group of arrogant hyenas into the depths of the bushes and make them never escape again\!

Soon, he ran into the depths of the bushes with the thirty-plus spotted hyenas behind him.

Just as he stopped and was about to kill, he suddenly felt that something was wrong.

A strong hyena scent filled the surrounding grass.

Before he could react, a black shadow suddenly jumped out from the grass beside him and pounced at him at lightning speed\!

Those dark eyes were filled with a cold and bloodthirsty light\!

Two rows of snow-white and sharp thick fangs were revealed in its open mouth\!

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to dodge. He suddenly swung his claws and faced it\!

The black shadow did not use its mouth to attack. Instead, it swung its claws and collided heavily with Chu Xiaoye’s claws\!

"Bang\!"

The two claws collided and Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt his body tremble. His right claw was actually a little numb.

The black shadow landed on the ground and looked at him coldly.

It was a black hyena\!

The patterns on its body did not completely disappear, but they seemed to be dyed black. It looked like they were about to turn completely black.

This spotted hyena was not too big, but the aura it emitted revealed its supreme status in this pack of spotted hyenas\!

It was the hyena queen\!

At this moment, the vegetation around them rustled as more spotted hyenas rushed out densely\!

Chu Xiaoye turned around and was shocked\!

This pack of spotted hyenas, in addition to the thirty-plus spotted hyenas from before, numbered in the hundreds\!

He had seen more than twenty of the spotted hyenas among them\!

That day at the edge of the forest, the Chino brothers and the little elephant had been ambushed by them. In the end, after he rushed back, they fled\!

It seemed that they had brought the entire team here to take revenge today\!

Looking at the densely packed dark eyes around him, Chu Xiaoye's heart could not help but feel a little cold.

No matter how powerful he was, he could not be a match for these nearly 100 spotted hyenas. If he was careless, he would be torn to pieces\!

The black hyena queen in front of him also gave him an extremely dangerous feeling. The strength of that slap just now was definitely not something an ordinary hyena could achieve\!

"Whoosh—"

Right at this moment, the hyena queen pounced forward again\!

The other hyenas surrounded them, surrounding all the paths.

Chu Xiaoye's right claw flashed with a cold light. He suddenly jumped up and faced it\!

"Bang\!"

Another two claws clashed\!

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled and he fell to the ground. He raised his right claw, and his palm was dripping with blood and burning with pain\!

The hyena queen's claws were also badly mutilated\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at its claws in shock. Its sharp claws were like the claws of a lion\!

A spotted hyena actually had a pair of lion's claws?

Chu Xiaoye was extremely shocked. He suddenly thought of something\!

He stared at the hyena's entire body and finally discovered a familiar brand on its right front leg\!

Although he could not see its code name, he understood that the hyena in front of him was the same as the tiger before. They were made by humans\!

No wonder its eyes looked so familiar and revealed such a human-like emotion\!

Did it escape from the other side of the mountain, or was it deliberately released over here by humans?

Could it be that this animal's paradise was also monitored by humans?

However, why were there still so many giant white lions on that snow mountain that had not been discovered by humans and had never appeared in human records?

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye thought of a possibility\!

Could it be that the white lion brought the animal leaders to the snow mountain to deal with these humans' creations? To prevent them from disturbing the rules of the grassland? To stop humans from using these creations to invade?

No matter what, Chu Xiaoye knew that he had to kill the hyena queen in front of him. He could not let her escape\!

If it attracted humans, not to mention being chased, all the animals on the grassland would be doomed\!

This beautiful grassland would probably suffer the most damage\!

The survival environment of their pride and other animals would completely disappear\!

This concerned the survival of the entire grassland\!

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly turned around and pounced at the hyenas behind him\!

He had to kill some hyenas first, mess up their formation, and make them feel fear. Otherwise, it would be difficult to kill this hyena queen\!

Golden light flashed\!

Two spotted hyenas' heads cracked open and they vomited blood as they fell to the ground.

When the other hyenas were about to open their mouths to bite, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and jumped onto a big tree beside him\!

Just as he was about to change directions and pounce on the hyena on the other side, he suddenly heard a strong wind behind him\!

The hyena queen actually jumped up and pounced at him\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to jump out again and immediately climbed up the tree\!

The hyena queen missed and landed steadily on the tree trunk he had just climbed. Her four sharp claws were tightly gripping the hard tree trunk\!

A dog could actually climb trees\!

Chu Xiaoye looked back, feeling shocked and absurd\!

Some humans' thoughts were too terrifying. He did not know why they were so perverted that they would make a species that violated the rules of nature.

With such an animal around, how could the entire grassland be peaceful?

The entire biological chain would probably suffer the most damage\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped out and jumped towards another tree\!

The hyena queen hesitated for a moment before immediately climbing down from the tree and chasing from the ground.

It seemed that she could only climb up the tree and did not dare to jump between the trees.

This was a breakthrough point\!

Its running speed on the ground was naturally not as fast as his jumping speed on the tree.

When the hyena queen ran under the tree, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and jumped back to the big tree from before. Then, he quickly jumped to the ground and pounced at the hyenas in front of him\!

When his golden claws cut open the necks of the spotted hyenas, he suddenly jumped up and landed on another tree.

He originally thought that the hyena queen would be furious and climb the tree again. She might even jump off the tree in anger to give him a chance. Unexpectedly, the hyena queen suddenly stopped and became exceptionally calm.

Chu Xiaoye climbed on the tree and turned to look at it.

Its dark eyes actually revealed a human-like ridicule.

The dense hyena army suddenly dispersed and scattered in every corner of the bushes.

If he wanted to continue killing, he had to jump several trees. After killing one or two, he could only jump up the tree again, or he would be surrounded and beaten up.

When he jumped up the tree again, the hyenas around him would scatter again, forcing him to jump between the trees again.

Although he was very strong and fast, how long could he last?

Soon, he would use up all his strength\!

If he stayed on the tree and did not move, the hyenas would stay here forever.

When he was unbearably hungry and his energy was gradually exhausted, it would be his death\!

This hyena queen should be thinking of this, right?

Seeing the human-like ridicule in the hyena queen's eyes, the killing intent in Chu Xiaoye's heart grew stronger\!

He knew that the longer he delayed, the more disadvantageous it would be for him\!

He jumped down from the tree and walked towards the hyena queen.

The hyenas that had dispersed around immediately gathered. They were dense and circled around.

On a Baobab tree not far away, the leopard family was hiding there, looking at him worriedly.

On the grassland more than ten kilometers away.

The moonlight was bright and the wind was cool.

A travel-worn young female cub was traveling through the night with a cute mother and son pair.

The female cub's tired and bright eyes were filled with determination.

Although the feces he left behind on the way had been buried and broken down, she still smelled them clearly.

She remembered every scent on his body clearly.
