Chapter 509: The Elf Princess Who Came Back

The orcs were very fast.

Two days later, the bridge had already been built to a distance of only 200 meters from the cliff here.

At this moment, the two cars and crossbows on the elves' side had been completed.

When Denise brought her people and carefully pushed the two car crossbows in front of the queen, the new queen, who had just registered with the elves, froze in place with a pale face.

The huge winch, the thick rope, and the extremely sharp iron arrows that were many times thicker than spears shocked her and frightened her completely.

Even if it was her Dolma who was struck by such an arrow, it would probably die after getting hit by just one arrow.

Denise looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was still in his elf form, and took the initiative to say for the first time, "There are still two more. They can come out tonight."

Chu Xiaoye circled the two cars and praised sincerely, "Lady Denise, your skills and speed are really beyond my expectations. The elves will definitely win with you."

The Queen smiled.

Denise' fair face actually blushed and she lowered her head slightly. "You don't have to call me lady. Just call me Denise. Without you, I can't do anything."

This tall and quiet girl looked at him with sincere admiration and gratitude.

At this moment, Vilis, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly lowered her head and muttered, "Night, I think that we're all family. It's better not to make a bet…"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at her in shock.

Where was the honor and dignity of knights and swordmasters?

The huge sword lolita's face was hot, but she still raised her chin and said proudly, "I'm afraid that if you lose, you won't have freedom again. Since we're all family, I've decided not to be petty with you. The previous bet is invalid."

"Dream on\!"

Chu Xiaoye would not let go of this opportunity to humiliate her easily.

She had been aggressive and was forced to retaliate. Now that she saw these two car crossbows, she suddenly wanted to go back on her word. How was that possible?

"You're a knight and a Great Swordmaster of the elves. What you said is not nonsense\!"

Chu Xiaoye mocked rudely.

Vilis' face turned red. Seeing that everyone was looking at her, she could only bite the bullet and say angrily, "I was afraid that you would lose, so I prepared to let you off\! Since you don't appreciate it, forget it\! At that time, don't cry to the Queen and say that I bullied you\!"

"Hehe."

Chu Xiaoye sneered and said, "When the time comes, I won't be the one crying."

"Hmph\!"

Vilis turned around, her chest heaving with anger.

After a while, seeing that no one was paying attention to her, she quietly walked to Annie's side and whispered, "Princess, you promised me that you would give me a mount. You didn't keep your promise, and I won't pursue it now. However, you have to help me and persuade that fellow to cancel the bet."

Annie did not know whether to laugh or cry. She whispered, "No, Vilis. I know his temper. Unless…"

"Unless what?"

Vilis' eyes lit up.

Annie whispered, "Unless you give in and beg him and apologize for what happened previously."

"Dream on\!"

Vilis rejected him angrily.

Wanting her to beg and apologize to a lion was an insult to her identity and the sword on her shoulder\!

Impossible\!

"An orc is not so easy to deal with. His crossbow is too heavy and can only be taken by surprise. It might be effective in the beginning, but when an orc rushed over recklessly with a corpse, it was useless."

Vilis said with an old expression.

She had fought with orcs for so many years, so she naturally knew.

Annie shrugged and said, "Perhaps."

However, she knew in her heart that this time, this elf with a huge sword would definitely lose.

In the evening, the four elf captains finally returned.

The elf captain named Loli reported to Lanisi, "Your Majesty, we have already transported 500 barrels of kerosene from the back mountain. Is it enough?"

The Queen looked at Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the canyon and nodded. "That's enough. I looked at the cliff previously. The orc army opposite has about ten thousand people. If they all enter this canyon, the kerosene should be more than enough."

Lanisi looked at him in shock and said, "Night, you're standing at the cliff and can see the orc army opposite? And you can count the other party's numbers?"

"You only know how to brag\!"

Vilis walked over with a look of disbelief.

The two sides of the cliff were very far apart and there were clouds floating in the middle. There was also a snow forest opposite. Even if the orc army opposite was burning with flames, it was difficult to see clearly, let alone count the number of people opposite.

"I can see clearly."

Chu Xiaoye did not explain and said confidently.

The Queen looked at him with flickering eyes and suddenly remembered that when the two of them fought in the arena previously, the other party spat out a cloud of black smoke that made her lose her vision. Before she could react, the sharp claws were already at her throat.

"Night, I believe you."

The Queen smiled and was a little excited. She could not help but hold his hand and say, "I will definitely keep my promise."

She had to keep such a talent no matter the price.

"Cough\! Cough, cough\!"

Vilis could not watch on anymore and changed the topic. "Your Majesty, did you waste so much effort and transport so much kerosene just to light the fire?"

This was actually said to a certain fellow.

Lanisi nodded and smiled. "Yes, it's to light a fire."

With that said, she suddenly woke up and looked at Chu Xiaoye. "Oh no, we seem to have forgotten to make more torches?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and realized that he seemed to have thought too highly of this queen previously.

He shook his head and said, "There's no need for torches, Your Majesty. Order them to move all the kerosene up the hill on both sides of the canyon and hide behind those big rocks. Everyone will lie in ambush there."

The Queen looked at him and suspected that she had heard wrong.

If everyone was ambushing above, wouldn't this canyon be unimpeded?

After passing through the canyon, the orcs would reach their city.

With the ferocity of the orcs, they would definitely rush out of the canyon like a flood and into their city.

Could it be that at that time, they could only watch helplessly as their city was destroyed on the hill?

"Idiot\!"

Vilis said rudely, "Your Majesty, we can't listen to this fellow anymore. I'll lead the team and guard the entrance of the canyon. As long as the orcs cross the bridge, we'll rush up and definitely not let them take a step forward\! The bridge is not wide. Although there are many orcs, they can't come over at once. As long as we hold on there and don't retreat, it'll be difficult for them to charge over."

To be honest, this method was not bad.

The narrow bridge limited the orcs from surging over like the tide, giving the elven soldiers a chance to concentrate their strength on dealing with small groups.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that there were only more than 1,000 elves left, and most of them were women and children. If they fought like this, there would definitely be many casualties.

Furthermore, the orc army would rush over endlessly. At that time, most of the more than 1,000 elves would be heroically sacrificed at the bridge.

Then, what would be the point of winning this war in the end?

"Your Majesty, please believe me. We can't guard the bridge, let alone use the remaining fire seed left by the elves to guard it with our lives and blood. Give up the bridge and let the orcs enter the canyon. I have a way to deal with them."

Chu Xiaoye said with a determined gaze.

"Clang—"

Vilis suddenly pulled out the sword on her shoulder and looked at him coldly. "You're a spy\! You want to destroy the elves completely\! Your Majesty, you can't listen to him\!"

This battle concerned the survival of the entire elves. Her worries were not without reason.

Queen Lanisi frowned, seemingly hesitating.

She did trust Chu Xiaoye, but she actually shared the same thoughts as Willis on this matter. After all, they had experienced many battles together.

"Sister, listen to Night."

Suddenly, an unfamiliar voice came from the side.

The big black bear suddenly stood up with a bewildered expression.

Lanisi's body trembled. She turned around and looked at the girl in a white dress.

Annie's face revealed a determined expression similar to hers. Her eyes trembled as she said softly, "It's me, Sister. I'm back."

"Annie."

Lanisi walked over and hugged her, tears flickering in her eyes.

Her soul and memories had finally returned.

"Believe in Night, he's right."

Annie said softly.

Lanisi let go of her and nodded with tears in her eyes. "Yes."

Vilis stood at the side and slowly inserted her sword into the sheath. She said with a trembling voice, "Princess, since you believe him, I also choose to believe him."

Ever since they were young, they had the best relationship. She understood this princess. Her intelligence was definitely above hers.

Annie walked in front of her and hugged her too.

Vilis cried tears of joy.

"Thank you, Denise."

After hugging Vilis, Annie looked at the arrow girl and thanked her softly.

Since Lanisi had become the queen, it meant that they had finally attacked and succeeded.

As for the old queen, she never thought that she was her mother, let alone admit that she was the queen of the elves.

"Night."

Princess Annie turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye. "Thank you too. Without you, my soul and memories will never return."

Chu Xiaoye said coldly, "Where's my Annie?"

The princess smiled and walked over. She held his hand and placed it on her warm face. She said softly, "Your Annie is here too. We merged together. I'm here and she's here."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he retracted his hand, feeling a little unfamiliar.

The princess no longer had any romantic feelings. She turned around and looked at Lanisi. "Sister, give all your authority to Night. Until the end of this battle, all the elves must listen to his orders."

She did not sound like she was begging, but like she was ordering and could not be refused.

The Queen was not unhappy nor did she hesitate. She immediately instructed the four captain guards to pass down her orders.

In every battle in the past, the princess had her own thoughts, but no one believed her or gave her the right. This was because she always targeted her mother and could not obtain the Queen's appreciation and love.

She could only fight silently alone until she became a traitor in the end.

Now, Lanisi had become the queen and Lanisi was willing to give her all the rights and respect.

Chu Xiaoye left with the four elf captains. He had to personally lead them to set up those terrifying kerosene. He had to be careful with every barrel, or his previous efforts might be wasted.

Furthermore, he had many things to remind them personally.

This battle concerned his and Catherine's lives. He had to do it himself and not make a single mistake.

He turned into a lion and agilely climbed up the hill.

His sword and clothes fell to the ground and were picked up by Catherine.

"Look, Night is so responsible."

The Queen looked at his busy back and said in relief.

The princess did not speak.

The Queen sighed and said, "Annie, you saw it too. Night needs a sword attendant. Who should I give him?"

The princess was silent for a moment before saying, "He's very intelligent and useful to us elves. He indeed needs a guard to protect him. He needs someone who's both a sword attendant and a guard. There aren't many candidates like that."

Lanisi sighed again and looked at Alice. "Alice, do you have a candidate in mind?"

Vilis was stunned for a moment before she shook her head.

However, the Queen was still looking at her.

The princess looked at the cliff.

At this moment, she would not waste time on this matter. She needed to find out what was missing and help the elf youth block any gaps that he had accidentally left.

"Vilis, we all want to make Night stay with the elves, right?"

Seeing that she still did not react, the Queen could only speak more clearly.

Vilis was silent for a few seconds before saying, "He does have some ability."

The Queen walked to her side and grabbed her hand. She whispered, "Then, let's think of a way to make him stay, okay?"

Vilis looked up at the queen and waited for her to continue.

The Queen smiled and blinked. "Men, other than liking power and money, are women, especially beautiful women. What do you think?"

Vilis revealed a mocking expression and said, "Our elves don't have anything else now, but we have a lot of beautiful women and all sorts. That fellow will definitely forget about it. Your Majesty, rest assured."

The Queen raised her hand and tidied the hair at her temples. She looked at her beautiful and cute face and said, "Vilis, what I mean is that Night needs a wife, a true wife. As for the other girls, he can choose them as long as his wife agrees."

Vilis' expression changed slightly, as if she had sensed something.

She looked at her queen with trembling eyes and said in disbelief, "Your Majesty, could it be that… you… you want to sacrifice yourself?"

Lanisi rubbed her forehead and closed her eyes, feeling very tired.

She no longer beat around the bush and looked at the petite girl with superb sword skills and a poor mind. "Vilis, you're born with divine strength. Even with two swords, you can handle it with ease. Furthermore, you knew Night first. Why don't you…"

"Sister."

Annie suddenly walked over and interrupted her. "A sword attendant can't be a wife. A wife will have emotions and is not suitable to help others hold a sword."

The Queen was stunned for a moment and swallowed the words that she was about to say.

As for Vilis, she already understood.

She widened her eyes and blushed.

Annie looked at Denise and said, "I think another person is more suitable."
