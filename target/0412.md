Chapter 412: Untitled

At dawn, the rain was still pouring.

The sky was dark and the already dark ancient forest looked even darker, damp, and cold.

No matter how dense the bushes were, they could not stop the endless rain.

Chu Xiaoye shook the raindrops on his fur and crawled out of the bushes. He saw that everyone was still hiding in the bushes and sleeping, seemingly unwilling to get up.

The laziness of lions was innate.

After eating, they slept. They even felt that playing was a waste of time.

Of course, it was also forced by life.

The lack of food and preciousness of it made them not dare to do too much exercise. Hence, they developed the habit of being lazy generation after generation.

However, this was not the time to be lazy.

The ground was filled with the corpses of bats. Even with the rain, those carnivores with a sharp sense of smell could still smell the blood here.

Trouble would soon arrive.

Furthermore, this was a dangerous swamp. As the rain fell, the risk factor would increase again. It was better to leave as soon as possible.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to roar and wake everyone up, he suddenly realized that there was an unfamiliar young female lion lying beside the mud pit not far away.

The female lion did not look for bushes to avoid the rain. Instead, she lay there motionless. Her fur was wet from the rain and she looked rather miserable.

Chu Xiaoye thought of the lioness he saved last night.

Could it be that she had already died because her injuries were too severe?

Chu Xiaoye walked over.

When he walked close, he realized that the lioness was still alive and well. Instead, she was still looking at him coldly with her eyes wide open. She did not feel any gratitude towards her savior.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He extended his claws and pushed her head, wanting to see if she was already crippled. Otherwise, why was she lying here motionless?

Alisa lay on the ground, tilted her head, and glared at him, still motionless.

"Poor little fellow. Her spine is probably broken and she can't even stand up."

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and touched her neck down to her butt. However, he was puzzled to discover that the female cub's spine was fine and did not break.

Then, could she have suffered internal injuries?

Chu Xiaoye placed his claws on her abdomen again, wanting to check her internal organs. As long as she was injured, the female cub would react if he pressed gently.

However, after he pressed for a long time, the little lioness did not have any reaction to the pain. She only trembled and bared her sharp claws, her eyes almost popping out of their sockets.

"It seems that she's sick and she can't react to stimuli. She might have soaked in the mud for too long and caught a cold from the rain."

As the saying goes, save someone until the end. Since he had saved this female cub last night, he naturally could not leave her in the lurch now.

Chu Xiaoye bit off a few green leaves from the bushes at the side and chewed them into pieces. He mixed them with his saliva and turned them into green juice.

He leaned in front of the female cub and used his two claws to forcefully open her mouth. Then, he lowered his head and prepared to spit the juice in his mouth.

His saliva was magical.

"Bang\!"

However, not only was this female cub not grateful, she suddenly flicked her claws and smashed them into his eyes like a human fist.

Chu Xiaoye tilted his head and fell to the ground.

However, at the moment of the heavy punch, the leaves in his mouth had already been sprayed out and landed on the female cub's mouth and face.

"Ouch—Ugh —"

Alisa suddenly jumped up and was about to roar angrily when she suddenly vomited.

Chu Xiaoye got up from the ground and was surprised to see that not only could she stand up, she also looked lively.

It turned out that the female cub was doing well.

When the other members of the pride heard the noise, they crawled out of the bushes and looked over in confusion.

Catherine, Mei Mei, Little Curly Tail, and the others ran over and surrounded the lioness cub.

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and looked like he wanted to fight.

Mei Mei widened her eyes and looked at her brother. She saw that one of his eyes was red and swollen and filled with tears. He had clearly been beaten.

This ungrateful lioness actually dared to hit her brother\!

"Roar—"

Mei Mei roared angrily to express her anger.

Her brother was the king of the pride and had supreme authority in this team. No one could disobey or bully him\!

Chu Xiaoye waved his claws to show that he was fine.

However, he was even more curious about this unfamiliar lioness cub. She could actually use her claws as fists and attack very quickly and with great strength. Indeed, she was the lioness who had defeated the giant crocodile king.

"Let's go\!"

Chu Xiaoye growled at the pride and turned to walk in front.

As for whether this lioness cub stayed or went, he did not care.

Alisa stopped vomiting and watched as he strode away. Her eyes flashed and she looked at the other members beside her.

"Go\!"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei's attitudes were very strong.

In their hearts, this female cub was already a member of their brother's pride. In the future, she might even have to carry on the family line for their brother.

Alisa narrowed her eyes and saw that the few tall lions had also surrounded her. She could only lower her head and follow behind. She looked at the figure in front of her and cursed in her heart, I'll definitely return today's touch a hundredfold next time\! Just you wait\!

"Ugh —"

Thinking of the green juice that was mixed with saliva just now, she could not help but vomit again.

She gritted her teeth and thought to herself again, "Today's vomiting is irreconcilable\! Just you wait\!"

For animals, food was everything. She had not eaten anything last night, and now that she spat out the only food in her stomach, this hatred was naturally irreconcilable\!

Chu Xiaoye did not know that he had been targeted by a female lion. He narrowed his eyes and looked ahead. He vaguely saw a group of yellowish-brown things gathered there, not knowing what they were doing.

The dense leaves blocked his vision. The rain was getting heavier and the leaves were crackling.

However, he still heard a familiar buzz.

After walking for a distance, he finally saw the true appearance of those things and was shocked.

They were actually a group of poisonous bees that were huge and comparable to sparrows\!

At this moment, the poisonous bees were actually gathered on a slightly rotten corpse, fighting to suck the flesh\!

The corpse had already revealed its white bones and could not be seen clearly.

The remaining flesh was disappearing at a visible speed.

Seeing this scene, the other members of the pride were shocked.

This group of poisonous bees actually started to suck flesh like the group of bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes they had seen in the past\!

"Buzz —"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to carefully circle around with the team, the poisonous bees suddenly heard a noise. They immediately flapped their wings and flew up, charging towards them aggressively.

"Run\!"

This was the first thought that came to Alisa's mind when she saw the poisonous bees flying over.

Because she had seen how terrifying these poisonous bees were\!

Their sharp teeth, fangs, speed, and combat skills were useless in front of these poisonous bees.

However, to her surprise, the stupid lions beside her did not immediately flee in panic when they saw the poisonous bees pouncing on them. Instead, they quickly moved forward and surrounded the young lion king. Furthermore, they covered their noses with their claws.

What was this?

Alisa stood at the side, looking stunned and confused.

Of course, she knew that it was impossible to escape. She could only save her own life by finding a mud pit or a waterhole to jump in.

However, on the way here, there was only a waterhole very far away. She could not see there.

What should she do?

Could it be that she had to be like those idiots? Even if they died, they had to loyally surround that perverted lion king and live and die with him\!

Pui\!

Even if I die, I will never approach that pervert\!

"Pfft—"

Right at this moment, black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye's butt. It instantly made the poisonous bees at the front dizzy and they fell to the ground one after another, dying\!

"Buzz —"

More poisonous bees rushed over\!

"Whoosh\!"

Alisa's figure flashed and rushed into the pride. She lowered her head and crawled into the innermost area, sticking tightly to Chu Xiaoye's neck. Then, she lowered her head and prepared to turn down.

However, the bottommost seat had long been occupied by Mei Mei.

Mei Mei stuck her head out from under Chu Xiaoye and glared at her, indicating that her brother's lower part was hers and that she could only be on top.

Alisa turned her head and ignored her. Just as she was about to look at the poisonous bees, she suddenly saw a black smoke surge towards her. Then, an extremely terrifying stench crawled into her nose.

At this moment, she finally understood why everyone had to cover their noses with their claws.

"Ugh —"

She vomited again and immediately felt dizzy. Her entire body turned limp and she almost fainted.

It was really smelly\!\!\!

The buzzing of the poisonous bees soon stopped.

However, the black smoke had yet to completely dissipate, and the terrifying stench naturally dispersed even slower.

Finally, when Alisa vomited until she fell limp on the ground and could not spit out anything again, the terrifying stench finally disappeared in the rain.

"It seems that this lioness is not suitable to be my brother's lioness."

Mei Mei looked at the lioness lying on the ground vomiting and almost fainting. She was very disdainful. Such a lioness could not even adapt to her brother's smelly fart. How could she serve her brother in the future?

Forget it\!

The poisonous bees fell to the ground. Some were still struggling on the ground, but they could not fly anymore.

After Chu Xiaoye finished farting, he felt refreshed. He wagged his tail and led everyone forward.

As for the lioness cub that was lying motionless on the ground, he did not care about her.

This time, no one forced her to follow.

If she could not adapt to the king's smelly fart, it meant that she was not qualified to serve the king. Let her fend for herself here.

Alisa lay on the ground, wanting to cry.

In just half a day, she had suffered great humiliation and torment that she had never experienced in her life. The perverted lion king's abnormality had already reached the extent of angering the lion god\!

How many years of feces had been stored in his stomach to spew out such a terrifying fart\!

No\!

This hatred was different. She could not let him escape\!

Alisa immediately got up from the ground with difficulty and chased after him.

How could she leave before taking revenge?

She believed that her strength was not weaker than that of the perverted lion\!

As long as she could think of a way to stop the perverted lion's mouth and butt from roaring and farting, she could definitely take revenge\!

"Hmph\! Just wait\!"

The drizzle turned into moderate rain and then into a heavy downpour.

The ground was wet and slippery, making it difficult to walk.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and brought the team through the rain and thorns, passing through the forest and advancing slowly.

They walked until evening. Seeing that everyone was drenched, not only was it cold, but they were also exhausted, they could only stop and find a place to hide from the rain.

He first jumped up the tree and observed the situation around him. Then, he jumped down and crawled into a bush.

The rain poured and the leaves crackled.

The other members of the pride hurriedly searched for bushes to hide in.

The little girl had the fur of the leopard on her head and crawled into the bushes Chu Xiaoye was hiding in. The big black bear did not dare to go over and could only find a place to hide at the side.

Although Chu Xiaoye did not say it explicitly, the members of the pride naturally maintained a distance from him, especially when they were resting and eating.

This was the status and dignity a lion king deserved.

However, this human girl did not seem to understand.

Even if she knew, it would probably be difficult to follow it.

In her heart, this young lion king was the only one in this team who was closest to her and she trusted him the most. Even the big black bear that was obedient to her could not compare to him.

She crawled into the bushes and naturally leaned on Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye wanted to slap her away, but he saw her pick up a withered branch and write on the soft soil. She muttered, "King, I dreamed that you were talking to me again last night. We were communicating through writing."

Then, she straightened up and raised her head. Her beautiful big eyes trembled as she stared at him and smiled. "King, why don't I teach you how to write? This way, I won't be bored in the future, okay?"

After saying that, she smiled, as if she was mocking herself. How could a lion understand her words, let alone write?

She sighed slightly.

Just as she tilted her head and was about to lie down, Chu Xiaoye suddenly extended his claws and wrote a word on the soft soil. "No\!"

The little girl trembled and suddenly straightened her body. She widened her eyes and looked at him in disbelief. Her mouth trembled as she said, "You… You… You…"

"I'm a king, omnipotent\!"

Chu Xiaoye gave her a calm gaze and turned around. He turned around and closed his eyes, like an invincible peerless expert.

Although he was low-key, he could not let a little girl who smelled like milk treat him as a stupid beast and a fool who knew nothing\!

"You're human\!"

Unexpectedly, the little girl suddenly said that after stammering for a long time.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was extremely shocked, the little girl pounced on him and burrowed her head into his abdomen. Her two hands started to touch randomly, just like how he touched the female lion previously.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. Just as he was about to slap her, the little girl suddenly said excitedly, "You must be a human wearing lion skin\! Annie suspected you long ago\! Quickly open the skin and let Annie see you."

At this moment, Belia was twisting her waist and feeling aroused. She crawled in with a fawning expression and happened to see the intimate scene of the girl and lion touching each other.

The jealousy in Belia's heart finally overturned\!

It turned out that her greatest opponent was not Catherine's lioness cub, but this strange little thing wearing gazelle skin\!
