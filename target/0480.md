Chapter 480: Lost

It seemed that there would be no lack of food.

Fresh meat, enemies, and companions were all mixed together.

The strong smell of blood filled the entire cave at the bottom of the tree, making the tired and hungry pride drool.

They were covered in blood and wounds, but their appetites were still astonishing.

Mei Mei limped and picked up half of the lion's corpse with her mouth. She climbed up the tree hole above her and placed the still warm fresh meat in front of Catherine for her to eat.

Although Catherine was cold and heartless and guarded the entrance to prevent her from entering, although in the battle of life and death just now, this female cub was still guarding here indifferently.

However, she did not blame her.

Mei Mei knew that she was here only to guard her brother. Her brother was the only thing she had to guard.

Any enemy who dared to climb up and threaten her brother would be cut open by her sharp claws. No one was an exception until she died in battle.

Mei Mei knew her loyalty and feelings for her brother, as well as her personality.

"Eat. At least, in order to continue protecting my brother."

Mei Mei left her prey behind and turned to limp away. However, her heart suddenly ached and she felt a little sad.

What was wrong with his brother?

Was it really like what everyone thought? Without fur, he would fall into depravity, become weak and timid, and be unable to withstand a single blow? Did he not even have the courage to come out and take a look?

No, she did not believe it.

No matter what, she would not believe that her brother would become like that.

Ever since she was young, she had always believed in her brother.

This time was no exception\!

"Brother will definitely come out\! He is our family and our king. He will never give up on us\!"

Mei Mei jumped down and looked at the cold father firmly, as if she was telling him or herself.

The cold father glanced at her coldly and ignored her. He raised his head and looked up.

Then, he slowly walked under the thick root that led to the top and lay there, looking at the second hole with his face covered in blood.

He knew that everyone knew that this hole could not be guarded in the end.

The pride outside might have stopped fighting for the time being, but they would definitely return because the most terrifying killer could not wait any longer. Otherwise, he would not have used his terrifying brute force to smash the hole.

The cold father shook his head slightly. Although his skull was healing from the sharp teeth, it was still very painful.

Blood dyed his head and eyes red.

For some reason, at this moment, he was already fearless. The death that had once made him tremble and fear suddenly became so light-hearted and ignored him.

Could it be because he was old?

Aisha, Xi'er, and Maya walked over with wounds and accompanied him.

They surrounded the thick root, as if they had once stood in a circle when they were attacked by the hyena army and surrounded the fragile cubs.

Night fell.

The exhausted members did not sleep.

The leopard family of four snuggled together and licked the wounds on each other.

Pit returned to the cave alone and accompanied Qiqi and Nunu.

Its two companions had already died heroically and were torn to pieces by the ferocious lions.

The Jerry brothers lay at the entrance of the cave and looked outside silently. Their entire bodies were dyed red with blood and there was almost no intact skin.

The fur on the Mixed Fur also turned red.

The bloody day finally passed.

But what about tomorrow?

Just as the sky lit up, another thunderous slap suddenly sounded from above the first hole.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The cave trembled and soil fell.

Every slap seemed to slap their hearts, making them tighten and almost suffocate.

The terrifying killer finally could not help it.

Little Curly Tail and Mixed Fur guarded there and could only watch helplessly as the soil above them fell. The crack grew larger and larger, but they were powerless.

They retreated and had no choice but to retreat.

The slapping sounds continued for a few hours. The terrifying killer seemed to have endless strength. Every slap seemed to be the power of thunder.

"Boom\!"

The first hole finally collapsed.

The soil rolled down the steep slope. The hole that could only accommodate two lions suddenly expanded two to three times.

The loud roars of the lions came from outside.

However, no lion was the first to enter.

They had learned their lesson from yesterday and did not rush in immediately.

Little Curly Tail and Mixed Fur were still guarding there.

They knew that they could not guard that place anymore, but they had nowhere to hide.

"Bang\!"

Suddenly, the terrifying slapping sounds also came from above the third hole.

"Roarâ€”"

Little Curly Tail suddenly growled and abandoned the first hole.

He slowly retreated until he was beside the cold father and stood beside his father and mother.

Mei Mei and Molly also came over.

Mixed Fur did not come over.

He bared his fangs and let out a terrifying roar. He still stayed in place and did not move, like a warrior who would rather die than retreat.

The Jerry brothers did not come over either.

They guarded in front of the second hole with determined gazes and faced death calmly.

Cracks started to appear at the third hole.

The leopard family of four stood up and walked side by side. They used their bodies to form a wall of flesh and blood.

Today, they would use their lives to repay this pride\!

"Boom\!"

With fierce slaps, the third hole finally collapsed.

The soil splashed them and almost buried them alive, but their family of four did not take a step back.

"Roarâ€”"

The deafening roar of the saber-toothed tiger came from outside.

The terrifying killer was urging the pride to attack.

At this moment, the sky outside was already dusk.

The sun was about to set and night was about to arrive. The darkness followed like a shadow.

The roars of the prides sounded outside.

Outside the three holes, fierce and cautious faces were gathered.

Even though the three holes had been expanded and they could already surge up and rush in, they were still hesitant and hesitant.

Their first attack made them suffer heavy losses, and it also let them see how tenacious and terrifying this pride was.

Who wanted to be the first to die?

No one wanted to.

However, every tribe had their own hierarchy.

The Saber-Toothed Tiger's roar made all the members of the pride tremble in fear.

The roars of the remaining two lions made the remaining lions tremble in fear.

However, there were still female lions below those lions.

Hence, female lions were chased in one after another.

Before mutation, all the lions in the pride were brave warriors. In every battle, the lions took the initiative to fight. Even if they fled and died in battle, they would not force the female lions to fight.

Now, when they had additional intelligence and strength, they had changed.

Almost any race liked to bully the weak.

The female lions came in, terrified. They bared their fangs and trembled all over, using their roars to eliminate their fear.

However, when they saw the situation in the cave, they immediately stopped being afraid.

They were all injured and there were very few of them.

This time, they would definitely win\!

"Roarâ€”"

The saber-toothed tiger's deafening roar sounded again.

All the lions roared and rushed in\!

"Bang\!"

The Jerry brothers, who were guarding the second hole, were sent flying without any ability to resist.

A huge figure jumped in\!
