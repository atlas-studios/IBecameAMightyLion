Chapter 548: Ferocious Beast Iron Steed Troop

They rested for the night.

The next day, everyone was full of energy and spirit.

Other than our Lady Vilis.

Vilis vomited all night last night and almost vomited her stomach out.

After knowing that she had been played, the huge sword loli wanted to take revenge, but she vomited until she could not even hold her sword.

This morning, when everyone woke up, she had two dark circles under her eyes and was sitting under the tree in a daze. She looked extremely haggard and had nothing to live for.

Chu Xiaoye could not bear to do so. He went over to apologize, but he only received one sentence.

"Just you wait\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not care about this threat.

He took out a few ripe fruits from his bosom and handed them to the huge sword loli. "Your stomach is clean, right? Eat something so that you can go on your way later."

"Get lost\! I won't eat…"

"There are only these few fruits. We ate the rest."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her with a faint smile.

"I won't eat it\! I won't eat your food even if I die\!"

The huge sword loli still said stubbornly, her eyes spitting flames as she glared\!

"Alright, I'll throw it away."

Chu Xiaoye took back the fruit and threw it in the grass at the side. Then, he clapped his hands and turned to leave. "It's time to set off."

The moment he turned around, Vilis immediately pounced into the grass beside him like a hungry wolf. She grabbed the fruit and wolfed it down.

She was hungry.

Her stomach was rumbling with hunger since yesterday.

She had finally eaten some fruits last night, but she vomited them all out again. Her stomach was empty and she was twitching from hunger.

Chu Xiaoye heard the voice but did not look back and continued forward.

At least he had to save some face for this proud little loli.

A cool morning breeze blew and the air suddenly had an unfamiliar aura.

Chu Xiaoye's expression changed and he hurriedly said to Catherine, "Go and take a look at the tree\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine jumped up the tree beside her at lightning speed.

"Night, what's wrong?"

Lanisi, who was preparing to leave, hurriedly asked.

Catherine climbed onto a high branch and narrowed her eyes. She looked around and suddenly stopped at the southern grassland, her tail quickly wagging.

"Orc army\!"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and hurriedly said, "We have probably been discovered\! Let's go\!"

Catherine immediately rushed down from the tree.

Doya ran towards the fire dragon and said, "Come up quickly\! Athies, we have to go\!"

Vilis, who was wolfing down the fruits, immediately picked up the huge sword and ran to the side of the fire dragon. She jumped up and stepped on the hard armor.

After everyone rode on the fire dragon, Doya immediately said, "Athies, let's go\!"

Athies stood up and flapped his wings. He suddenly flicked his legs on the ground and flew up.

However, just as they rose from the bushes, the figures of two other fire dragons appeared in the sky.

The other two fire dragons immediately discovered them and let out sharp cries. At the same time, with a whoosh, they spat out two flames from their mouths and sprayed them down.

Athies did not dare to rise into the sky again. He immediately flapped his wings and flew past the bushes, flying at a low altitude.

"Whoosh\!"

Unexpectedly, right at this moment, two iron spears suddenly shot over from the backs of the two fire dragons. With a whoosh, they actually pierced into Athies' body\!

One pierced into its neck and one into its head\!

Athies immediately wailed and started to land.

Right at this moment, Denise fired three arrows at once. With a whoosh, she shot at the two fire dragons that were diving down and shot down the three orcs whose heads had just popped out from the backs of the two fire dragons.

The three orcs were extremely tall and strong. At first, they had been hiding behind the fire dragon's neck. Seeing that Athies had been hit by the spear, they could not help but stick their heads out and let out cries of joy. However, unexpectedly, in just an instant, their heads were pierced by an arrow and they fell from the back of the fire dragon, shattering into pieces\!

The two fire dragons were extremely timid. They were frightened by the three arrows and flapped their wings, flying into the sky and escaping quickly.

"Bang\!"

Athies fell to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye and the others, who were riding on its back, had already jumped down when it was about to land.

Denise rolled on the grass and immediately jumped up lightly. The bow in her hand shot out another arrow with a whoosh. It actually flew into the air and pierced into the tail of one of the fire dragons.

The two fire dragons were originally preparing to flee in the direction of the orc army and then return to take revenge. At this moment, they were terrified and immediately flapped their wings to fly higher into the sky, escaping from this grassland in a hurry. No matter how the orcs on the distant ground shouted, they did not dare to stop.

"Athies\!"

Doya ran to Athies' side and looked at its painful appearance, her eyes filled with tears.

Be it the tip of the spear or the shaft, the two spears were made of mature iron. At this moment, one was pierced into Athies' neck and the other into his head.

Obviously, this fire dragon could not survive.

It struggled painfully on the grass, already on the verge of death.

On the grassland 200 meters away, nearly a thousand Orc troops were roaring and charging over while riding all sorts of wild beasts.

"Miss Doya, we should go."

Although Chu Xiaoye knew that she was very sad, he had no choice but to remind her.

The orc army had already arrived and Athies could not be saved. If they hesitated again, they would all die on this grassland.

Although Doya was sad, she did not hesitate at all. She immediately turned around and wiped her tears. "They are the ferocious beast cavalry on the Tutur grassland. The ferocious beasts under them can run for a long time on the grassland. We can't escape. The only solution now is to enter the bushes first to prevent them from scattering and trampling us. Then, I'll go out and negotiate with them."

Although this girl's eyes were filled with tears, she was still calm.

"Go\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately pulled her up and ran towards the grassland not far away with the elven girls.

Fortunately, they did not fly too far just now. Soon, they rushed into the bushes.

This forest was lush with vegetation and was different from the sparse grassland and bushes he had previously visited. It was like a primitive forest with dense vegetation. Although it was not big, the vegetation inside was dense and very tall and tough. It was difficult to walk and destroy. There were only a few empty spaces. It was impossible for the ferocious beast cavalry to rush in all at once.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not optimistic about Doya's negotiation.

Athies was killed by their sneak attack. The two fire dragons were also frightened away by Denise's arrows, and Denise shot three more dragon-riding orcs to death.

Obviously, the other party was not prepared to let the matter rest from the beginning. It was even more impossible now.

The rumbling of iron hooves stopped outside the bushes.

A few orcs looked at Athies' corpse, shouted, and then looked at their three companions who had been smashed to pieces. They roared and cursed.

"Surround this place\! Kill them\!"

The orc general's words were transmitted into the bushes.

Hence, the orc cavalry riding ferocious beasts immediately split up and surrounded the bushes to prevent them from escaping in other directions.

Just as Doya was about to go out and negotiate with them, Chu Xiaoye pulled her back and shook his head. "It's useless. The death of those three orcs has already angered them. Furthermore, when they see Athies, they will definitely think that we're very rich and will never let us go."

Doya looked at him with tears in her eyes and said, "Lord Night, is there any other way?"

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and looked outside. "I looked at the mounts under them. Most of them are lions and leopards. There are also some rhinoceroses and wild cows. These wild beasts are probably their war beasts, right?"

Doya nodded and said, "Yes, these beasts were raised by them since young and are very loyal to them. They can be mounts or battle beasts. They're very brave and fierce."

Chu Xiaoye said meaningfully, "No matter how loyal the wild beasts growing on the grassland are, they can't forget their instincts. They will still be afraid and lose their sense of propriety, right?"

Doya said in confusion, "Lord Night means…"

At this moment, the orcs outside had already completed the encirclement and were entering carefully with weapons in hand.

Chu Xiaoye immediately said to Denise and Fei'er, who were behind him, "Shoot\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The arrows flew out and the orcs fell to the ground before they could see them.

"Retreat\! They have archers\!"

"Release the war beasts\! Let our ferocious war beasts tear them apart\!"

The orc general roared.

Hence, a group of lions, leopards, rhinoceroses, and other ferocious beasts rushed in first.

"Lord Night, what should we do?"

Fei'er's face turned pale when she saw that the entire forest was surrounded by ferocious beasts.

"Cover your ears first, then follow me and charge out\! Do you see the three rhinoceroses? At that time, they will suddenly flee in panic. Lanisi, Vilis, and Fei'er, run with me later. You have to jump onto their backs and treat them as your mounts. Doya, ride on Catherine. She's very fast and will protect you. As for Denise…"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the tall girl at the back and said, "You ride on me. At that time, I'll charge at the front. You can use arrows to help clear the way, right?"

The most important thing was this sharpshooter girl.

His lion king roar could not deter all the orcs. The weapons in the orcs' hands were a huge threat to him and the girls. If they could not rush out before the orc army could react, all their previous efforts would be wasted.

They could not delay at all. They had to run and fight as they rushed out at their fastest speed.

Therefore, Denise's arrows had to be fast and accurate. She could not make any mistakes.

He believed that this girl could do it.

Denise was silent for a moment before saying, "I can run directly."

Chu Xiaoye lowered his body and turned into a lion. He said, "Of course you can run yourself, but you're definitely not as fast as me. Furthermore, you'll be distracted. Listen to my orders, okay?"

Denise no longer hesitated and looked at him. "Yes."

"Fei'er, jump onto the back of the rhinoceros later and take care of the sides and back. Although it sounds like the mission is heavy, you will definitely be more relaxed than Denise. You only need to help me and her check on the ones we missed. Is that okay?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the pink-haired girl beside him.

Fei'er nodded firmly and said, "Yes\! Lord Night, don't worry. Fei'er can definitely do it."

"Then, prepare to cover your ears."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the few lions approaching in front and the few huge rhinoceroses following behind.

Suddenly, he turned around and looked at Vilis, who was about to cover her ears. "Lady Vilis, will it be difficult for you to jump onto such a tall rhinoceros’ back?"

Vilis was stunned for a moment and immediately glared. "I'll definitely jump higher than you\!"

Beside him, Lanisi and the others laughed.

Hence, the extremely tense atmosphere immediately relaxed.

Chu Xiaoye looked in front and said, "Alright, cover your ears and follow behind me. Denise, what are you waiting for? I'm very fast. You better clamp your legs and sit tight. Otherwise, you might fall before the arrow is shot."

Denise walked over and stood beside him. Her beautiful face turned slightly red.

The icy blue jade bow hung on her shoulder. The silver bowstring flickered with a moving luster like her beautiful hair that fell like a waterfall.

She raised her straight and strong long legs and straddled him.

Although Chu Xiaoye had already become very big, her legs were too long and her feet almost touched the ground.

"Roar —"

The few lions that led the way seemed to have smelled the scent of their own kind and immediately let out low roars, as if they were showing off their strength.

At this moment, ferocious beasts were in front and orcs were behind, slowly approaching from all directions.

"Go\! Bite them to death\!"

The orc roared angrily, urging the ferocious beasts walking in front.

"Roar—"

Suddenly\! A terrifying roar sounded in the bushes like thunder\!

Then, a terrifying air wave surged outwards like a storm\!

The first to bear the brunt was the circle of ferocious beasts at the front\!

They could not resist at all. Their bodies trembled and they fell limp to the ground. Blood flowed from their mouths and noses, and they died\!

Then, the ferocious beasts following behind also fell to the ground.

The ferocious beasts at the back instantly peed their pants in fear. They turned around and ran, breaking the orc formation.

As for the orcs, they suddenly felt their eardrums rumble and blood flow from their mouths and noses. They were dizzy, staggered, and almost fell. Under the terrifying impact of the ferocious beasts, they immediately fell and fell. It was chaos and they could not tell the direction.

The rhinoceroses were rather strong and did not fall to the ground. Instead, their eardrums exploded and they had a splitting headache. They turned around shakily in place and prepared to escape.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye immediately carried Denise and shot out like an arrow\!

Denise suddenly raised her body and almost fell.

"Clamp your legs\! Clamp them tightly\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and suddenly jumped up. He jumped onto a tree that was four to five meters high and stopped there.

Denise immediately clamped her legs tightly and stabilized her body. She took out her bow and arrow, her face red.

Lanisi and the others hurriedly chased up from behind. They jumped and jumped onto the backs of the three rhinoceroses that had already woken up and started to flee in fear.

Catherine dragged Doya and jumped up, following closely behind Chu Xiaoye.

Doya crawled on her body, hugging her neck tightly with both hands and her legs wrapped tightly around her abdomen. She felt the wind beside her ear roar and the trees flew past. She was so frightened that she immediately closed her eyes.

"Go\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped forward from the tree.

This way, Denise's target was clearer, but it was more difficult. She had to clamp her long legs more tightly and hook her two feet together.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Two arrows shot out and the two orcs in front of him, who were holding their heads and crying out, immediately fell.

"Don't waste the arrows\! Only shoot those blocking the way\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared and quickly rushed out of the bushes with the elven girls.

The orc cavalry outside the bushes had long been scattered by the impact of the terrified and fleeing ferocious beasts. They did not form a formation and ran around to dodge. If they were not careful, they would be sent flying by the crazy ferocious beasts.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise shot again.

The few orcs who were brandishing their weapons and preparing to rush up to stop him were shot in the throat and fell to the ground.

Lanisi and the other two pulled out their daggers and cut the rhinoceros’ butt. Hence, the three terrified rhinoceroses ran forward even more desperately. With their huge bodies and ferocious auras, which orc had just stopped them?

Fei'er, who was riding on it, held a bow and arrow, her pink hair flying as she helped Denise clean the orcs blocking the front.

Soon, they rushed out of the orc's encirclement and ran towards the grassland.

"Chase\! Chase\!"

The orc general roared angrily from behind, but they no longer had their mounts. How could they chase with their legs alone?

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine followed behind the three rhinoceroses, roaring and threatening them from time to time to prevent them from running in the wrong direction.

At the same time, Chu Xiaoye shouted at Lanisi and the other two on the rhinoceros’ back, "Continue to cut their butts\!"

Then, he roared at Denise, who was on his back, "Don't grab my mane\! Just clamp your legs tightly\!"

Denise still grabbed his mane and relaxed her legs.

Chu Xiaoye was furious and immediately jumped and ran.

Denise immediately rose and fell like duckweed on the waves, floating in the wind. She had no choice but to clamp her legs tightly again, but her face was pink and her eyes were filled with embarrassment.

"Shameless\!"

The huge sword loli, who was lying on the rhinoceros’ back, happened to see this scene and immediately cursed.
