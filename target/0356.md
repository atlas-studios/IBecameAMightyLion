Chapter 356: Untitled

When they returned to the forest.

Little Curly Tail and the others were waiting anxiously.

The surrounding trees were broken, the bushes were messy, and the ground was filled with the corpses of the chimpanzees.

Fortunately, they were all safe and sound.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the team and faced Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and his mother's love. He wanted to respond, but he could not roar. He could only raise his claws and signal to set off.

His silence puzzled everyone.

Because Catherine's injuries had not completely recovered, Chu Xiaoye brought the team to stop every now and then.

Only in the evening did they arrive at the top of the mountain.

Looking up, the forest and grassland on the other side were another scene.

The forest was lush with leaves that covered the sky like an ancient primitive forest. On the grassland, the sky was blue, the soil was fertile, and the grass was lush. There was no end to it.

Even the air that blew over carried a freshness that he had never tasted before.

This grassland was like another world\!

If their previous grassland was the most beautiful season now, then the new grassland in front of them would always be so beautiful and more beautiful every year.

The members of the pride of the cold father stood on the mountaintop and faced the breeze that blew from the sea, looking blankly at the new world in front of them.

It turned out that there was such a beautiful grassland in this world\!

In the future, they would never experience the dry season that made them fear and despair again\!

Until the sun set and the moon rose, the cold father was still standing on the highest rock and looking at the new grassland. He was motionless, like a stone sculpture.

No one knew what he was thinking at this moment.

However, it was definitely not regret.

Little Curly Tail was extremely excited. He surrounded Chu Xiaoye and jumped around. His tail swung like the propeller of a helicopter, emitting whooshing sounds. Mei Mei and Molly, who were beside him, dodged far away in fright.

"Clap clap clap clap\!"

The cold father had just turned around when he was slapped more than ten times. He was stunned on the spot.

Seeing that he had gotten into trouble, Little Curly Tail immediately put away his tail and pretended to be unaware. He left calmly and followed the mixed fur trio to hunt.

The cold father stood in place, his mouth full of blood, his eyes wide with anger, and his entire body trembling in anger.

After a while, he let out an angry roar.

"Unfilial son\!\!\!"

Aisha, Maya, and the other female lions hurriedly brought Qiqi and Nunu far away when they saw this scene, afraid that they would be implicated.

Chu Xiaoye listened to the cold father's roar and his throat suddenly felt a little itchy. The airflow in his chest became even more restless. He wanted to roar out loud, but he could only open his mouth and still not make a sound.

He was so quiet that he looked like he had a lot on his mind. Even Tilly, who liked to fool around with him, restrained her thoughts and looked at him carefully.

The little girl took out the beef jerky in her pocket and wanted to stuff it into his mouth, but he swung his mouth and threw it to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye was very frustrated.

He suddenly became a mute. He could not roar or make a sound. He was as quiet as a rock and almost suffocated to death.

He wanted to dig his throat with his claws and see what was happening.

Before long, Little Curly Tail returned with a prey.

The prey was the size of an adult gazelle, but its two ears were very long. It had gray fur all over its body and its eyes were red. On a careful look, it was a huge wild rabbit\!

This rabbit's size shocked everyone.

Xi'er and the female lions went up and nudged the huge wild rabbit with their claws. They looked at each other in disbelief.

At this moment, the mixed fur, blue eyes, and Jerry brothers also returned with two huge prey. Looking carefully, they were two warthogs that were even taller than the cold father\!

The two warthogs were not dead yet and let out terrified and miserable cries.

Pit, who was digging not far away trembled in fear. He turned around and looked at it, then crawled into the unfinished pit. He could not get out no matter what.

After excrement, Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth and jumped in the forest alone for a while, but it was still useless. Furthermore, he felt his chest becoming more and more stuffy, as if the airflow wanted to penetrate his chest and come out.

He did not dare to continue and returned dejectedly.

If it always turned out like this in the future, it was better to die.

A dignified lion king could not even roar. How sad was that?

If he fought other lions in the future, they would roar majestically and scare the surrounding little animals. As for him, he would not make a sound, like a sick cat. Even if he won, he would embarrass himself.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the tree and closed his eyes with a melancholic thought, but he could not sleep.

He was sad until dawn.

When the sun rose, the birds in the forest started to sing again.

Chu Xiaoye wanted to jump up and pluck their feathers\!

His constant silence made the members of the pride careful. They thought that he was in a bad mood and would be angry at any time.

Even the noisiest Little Curly Tail followed behind obediently and peeped at his expression.

After descending the mountain, they entered the dense forest.

The trees in the forest were thick and tall, covering the sky and sun. Leaves were piled on the ground, and it was damp and dark, looking gloomy.

The members of the pride of the cold father were extremely excited about this new world. They looked around excitedly, but in Chu Xiaoye's silent atmosphere, no one dared to show it too much.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to say, "Everyone, let loose. I'm fine."

However, he could not even express this sentence.

Soon, they arrived in front of the huge and rumbling waterfall.

To the pride of the cold father who lived on the plains all year round, they had never seen such a spectacular scene. When they saw this waterfall flowing down, they all stopped to look, widened their eyes, and were dumbfounded, as if it was the first time a bumpkin entered the city.

This time, the cute violent bear did not catch fish under the pool of the waterfall.

However, an injured fox was licking the wound on its leg alone on the rock beside the pool.

The fox had snow-white fur and a small body. It was even smaller than Qiqi and Nunu. It looked soft and weak and could not withstand a single blow. No one knew how it survived in the forest.

The aura of the pride soon woke the fox that was licking its wounds.

It suddenly stood up from the rock and raised its head, looking up nervously. It was stunned for a moment before it turned around, jumped down from the rock, and limped away.

However, it did not run far before it suddenly stopped and took a few steps back. It turned around and ran back. It stopped beside the pool and leaned against it with a terrified gaze.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly smelled a familiar scent. He looked up and saw a group of tall white wolves surrounding him neatly from the forest.

Was it still the white wolves that were attacking the cute violent bear?

Chu Xiaoye brought the team down the hill and stood beside the fox.

The white wolves also stopped in their tracks and gathered together, looking at them coldly.

The fox retreated to the pool, its muscles tense and it shivered.

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps forward, opened his mouth, and subconsciously wanted to roar to make way for the white wolves, but he did not make any sound.

He immediately blushed and walked over.

Tilly, Catherine, the little girl, and Little Curly Tail followed behind him and walked towards the white wolves.

Although this group of white wolves were tall and looked stronger than lions, the pride would not be afraid of them.

A wolf could never defeat a lion.

Be it a one-on-one or a team battle.

This group of white wolves knew their limits. When Chu Xiaoye walked towards them, the lead wolf immediately roared and turned to leave with the team. Its movements were elegant and calm. Although it was escaping, there was no trace of panic or embarrassment.

Seeing that the wolf pack had left, the fox clearly relaxed a little. Seeing that the lions were looking over, it did not hesitate and jumped into the pool with a splash. It drifted down with the water and soon disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye never thought of doing anything to it. He brought the team down the mountain.

They had just walked less than a mile when noisy footsteps suddenly came from the surrounding forest. Then, densely packed white wolves rushed out from the forest on both sides\!

Not only did the white wolves return, they also called for help and brought more white wolves.

Obviously, they were unwilling to give in just now.

These white wolves were all strong and about the size of the cold father. However, there were more than 50 of them. Their gazes were cold, their auras were strong, and their killing intent was murderous\!

On the grassland over there, no matter what species of wolf it was, they were much smaller than lions. When they saw lions, they would definitely tremble in fear and flee.

When they first came here, they encountered this group of different white wolves and members of the pride of the cold father. They were clearly a little stunned.

When the cold father used to guard the territory, he had encountered all sorts of lone wolves and wolf packs. A random roar could scare the other party until they peed their pants and fled. Be it in size or strength, he completely overpowered wolves.

But now, it seemed that he no longer had much deterrence.

At this moment, he seemed to understand something.

Although this place was good, the land was fertile, the water and grass were abundant, and there was plenty of food and no dry season, their prey and competitors were stronger.

Rabbits were even larger than gazelles, and the warthogs had become spirits. Now that even the wolves were larger than him, how could he survive in the future?

At this moment, the cold father started to feel uneasy and worried about his future life. His excitement and enthusiasm for this new world gradually disappeared.

More than fifty strong white wolves surrounded them.

The lead wolf with a scar at the corner of its eye walked out of the crowd and stared at them coldly, as if it was looking for the leader of this pride.

Then, it fixed its gaze on the little girl strangely and looked at Pit and Little Mi strangely, as if it found it unbelievable.

Little Curly Tail's tail was restless and his eyes were shining. He looked a little eager.

He would not be happy if he did not fight for a day.

Blue eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and the Chino brothers took the initiative to stand at the outer circle, protecting the other members of the cold father's pride in the middle.

The little girl stood nervously behind Chu Xiaoye, her two little hands gripping his tail tightly.

She had seen wolves on television and heard stories of wolves in fairy tales, but none of them were as terrifying as the white wolves she saw with her own eyes.

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth slightly and felt the murderous aura brought by the white wolves. The airflow in his chest surged towards his throat even more excitedly.

His heart raced, and his eyes widened. His entire body was tense. He felt a huge air wave that seemed to be about to break through the invisible barrier in his throat and almost break out\!

His body was like a bow that was full of strings. He had accumulated all his strength and seemed to be about to erupt at any time\!
