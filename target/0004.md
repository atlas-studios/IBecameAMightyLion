Chapter 4: The Hyena Is Here\!

It was a quiet night.

At least for the lions.

Chu Xiaoye woke up at dawn when the sky in the east started to turn white.

From afar, the low growl of a lion could be heard.

The Lion King, who always slept in during the day, went out to patrol his territory again when everyone was asleep at night.

He peed and rubbed his mane, leaving behind an aura that threatened his enemies.

Obviously.

Although he defeated the wandering lion in the evening, it gave him a lot of pressure.

In order to protect his territory and bloodline, he had to be more diligent and continue to strengthen the defence.

Chu Xiaoye stretched and got up from the ground, shaking off the grass on his fur.

Then, he raised his right claw and looked at it. To his surprise, he realized that the wound from last night had already healed and there was not even a scar left\!

It seemed that not only could his saliva stop bleeding, it could also quickly heal his wounds\!

This was a huge discovery\!

Most animals died from the infections of their wounds.

Now that he had this skill, his survival ability was greatly enhanced.

However, he did not slack off.

He began to continue practising climbing trees.

His right claw, which was injured last night, no longer hurt and seemed to have become stronger.

"Whoosh—"

This time, he only used one move to rush up the first branch.

Then, he continued upwards.

When Aisha heard the noise, she raised her head and glanced at him. She quickly got up and jogged over. She stood under the tree and raised her head, roaring anxiously.

It seemed to be saying, "Kid, don't be naughty. It's dangerous. Come down quickly. Mommy will catch you."

This tree was too small for her to climb up.

If she accidentally bent the tree, Chu Xiaoye would be in even more danger.

Hence, she could only growl from below, urging Chu Xiaoye to come down.

Chu Xiaoye climbed onto the second branch, still full of energy.

He originally wanted to continue climbing up, but could only retreat when he saw his mother crying out miserably and anxiously.

This time, he retreated very steadily.

When he was about to land, he jumped lightly and landed on the ground.

After being stabbed last night, he cleared away everything around the tree.

Since he wanted to practise climbing trees, he naturally had to eliminate all dangers beforehand. 

Aisha was a little surprised to see him climb down so easily. She stared at his small body and paused for a moment. Then, she stuck out her tongue and licked him lovingly, reminding him not to take any more risks and to sleep.

Chu Xiaoye could only lie down and close his eyes, pretending to sleep.

After the lioness left, he continued to climb the tree.

A red glimmer of light soon appeared on the horizon.

Gradually, the morning sun peeked out like a sneaky peeping tom.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the highest branch of the small tree and looked up at the beautiful sunrise. His heart was filled with pride\!

One day, he would become an awe-inspiring lion king that would make his enemies tremble in fear\!

Dawn finally arrived.

Out of the five diligent female lions, one stayed behind to look after the children while the other four set off to hunt in the morning.

Mei Mei's mother, the blind lioness Xi'er, was left behind.

She crawled in the bushes and watched as her sisters left with high spirits. There seemed to be sadness in her remaining eye.

Mei Mei was curled up in her arms, sleeping soundly.

The gentle morning sun shone on the mother and daughter, giving them a golden glow.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and looked at this beautiful and warm scene, feeling a little regretful.

His saliva could heal wounds.

However, there was no way he could heal a blinded eye. 

This loving mother lion had clearly been given the cold shoulder by her king, the majestic lion.

When the female lions set off to hunt, they rubbed their heads against the male lion's.

And when Xi'er went over to curry favor with the lion, she was mercilessly avoided by the lion.

Animals were like humans.

In fact, they were even more heartless than humans.

A blinded lioness would not only lose her image, but it would also affect her future hunting.

There were very few female lions in this pride. There were only five of them.

Now that Xi'er had lost an eye, her combat strength was greatly reduced.

In the future, the amount of food would also decrease.

Hence, the lion turned cold towards her.

Xi'er was very sad. She crawled in the bushes dejectedly and looked at her daughter, but she did not give up.

For her daughter, she could not give up.

The lion crawled on a nearby slope and closed its eyes to rest. He waited for the lionesses to return while protecting the cubs.

The lion looked very relaxed and lazy. He did not need to hunt and could enjoy the fruits of others' labor.

However, he was extremely important to the pride.

With him around, other wandering lions and carnivores did not dare to come and threaten the young cubs.

His huge body and fluffy and flamboyant mane could cause great fear to his enemies even if they were far away\!

Of course.

Nothing was absolute.

Just as he was enjoying the morning sun with his eyes narrowed, he heard sounds of "Ahhhh" coming from the bushes not far away\!

Those were the cries of hyenas and extremely annoying.

As the second brother of Africa, hyenas had an extremely strong bite that was even more terrifying than a lion's bite\!

Although their movements were ugly and they looked comical when they ran, they were extremely fast and had great endurance\!

Their noses were very sensitive. Even though they were very far away, they could still keenly pick up the smell of blood and move in groups.

They mostly ate rotten meat and loved to snatch the spoils of other carnivores. They were despicable and cunning.

Occasionally, they would hunt personally as well.

Of course, other than being called the Second Brother of Africa, they were also called the Anus-Biting Brothers.

Regardless of whether it was hunting or eating, most of them would go for the anus first.

Some living animals would die from hyenas biting their anuses. It was extremely tragic.

Normally, hyenas would never dare to be impudent in the territory of lions.

Especially where there were male lions.

In the grasslands, hyenas feared lions the most.

At this moment, the sounds of "ah ah ah ah ah" rang out from the bushes not far away. Clearly, many hyenas had gathered.

Could it be that they were too hungry and knew that the female lions had gone out to hunt? Did they want to attack the lions' base?

This was intolerable\!

The male lion immediately stood up and spread its majestic mane. It swung its tail and jogged over, letting out a furious roar\!

It seemed to be saying: Despicable and ugly thieves, how dare you behave atrociously in my territory\! I will teach you a lesson\!

Xi'er stood up and looked nervously at the young cub beside her. She raised her neck and looked at the running lion.

She hoped that her king could chase away those annoying hyenas.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the branch of the small tree, his heart trembling.

He knew how terrifying hyenas were.

These guys were not only cruel and perverted, but they also hunted in large numbers.

They dared to attack a lone lion.

If a hyena were to see a young cub like him, they would definitely chomp on him\!

Although his father was powerful and intimidating, it would be dangerous if dozens of them came.

Just as he was secretly worried, he caught a glimpse of a shadow from the corner of his eye. It flashed across the bushes in another direction\!

His heart trembled, and he hurriedly turned his head to look in another direction.

He almost fell off the tree in shock after looking.

In another direction, there was a cackle of hyenas. There were about seven or eight of them. They took advantage of the lion's departure and used the bushes as cover to sneak over quickly\!

If he had not been standing on the tree, he really would not have noticed\!

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

He hurriedly issued an alert to Xi'er and the seven cubs under the tree\!

This was bad\!

A lioness could not handle so many hyenas\!

The seven little cubs under the tree would probably be doomed\!
