Chapter 159: Stronger Enemies

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye pounced at the group of cubs\!

Before the female lions standing not far from the cubs could react, they saw a figure flash over with lightning speed, bite the neck of a cub, and run out.

With the lion king present and so many female lions, they never would have thought that this invader would be so daring\!

"Roar—"

The pride was furious when they saw this scene\!

Be it the three lions or the other lionesses, they roared and chased after him.

Chu Xiaoye bit the neck of a cub and quickly ran towards the forest. His running speed did not seem to be affected.

Roars came from behind. The lions were furious and wanted to tear him into pieces\!

The three adult lions did not run for long before they slowed down while panting and fell behind.

As for the female lions, they still ran over.

This pride was extremely strong. If they fought face to face, many wandering lions would not be their match.

Furthermore, there were many young cubs in this pride.

This would make the female lions in the pride more brave and united, and even risk their lives.

Therefore, even if Chu Xiaoye brought the brothers here, he could only flee.

Three strong adult lions and at least 16 female lions in the nurturing phase made this pride stronger than ever.

Anyone who wanted to attack this pride and this territory would pay a heavy price\!

Of course, Chu Xiaoye had never coveted this territory or the female lions who were mothers.

This territory bordered the forest and was not stable.

Although there were many water pits here, there were no rivers.

The river that flowed across the grassland was still in the distance.

Chu Xiaoye's ideal location was near the river.

Who would not like a riverview room?

He had to continue forward.

When he bit the cub's neck and ran out of the border of this territory, the female lions following behind him clearly hesitated for a moment, but they still chased after him.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in his tracks and turned around to look at them.

The female lions gradually slowed down as well. Then, they opened their mouths and stopped in front of him while panting.

As for the three adult lions, they had already disappeared.

Their thick mane made them look majestic, but also tortured them.

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth and placed the cub in his mouth on the ground.

The young cub immediately got up and was not afraid of him. It thought that he was playing with it. It walked crookedly to his feet, opened its small milk teeth, and bit him gently.

The female lions' eyes were shocked and surprised.

They thought that this young cub had already had its throat bitten off by this invader and died.

Chu Xiaoye raised his leg and kicked the cub into the air. Then, he turned around and left.

He had regained his confidence.

At least this powerful pride could not do anything to him.

Then, next, he should find a territory that he liked the most.

When the female lions saw him leave, they were stunned for a moment and did not chase after him. They immediately ran to the young cub and brought it back.

The three adult lions opened their mouths and stood at the borders of the territory, panting, waiting for them.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the lake and did not see the little elephant and the others.

Furthermore, he suddenly smelled a familiar and annoying scent.

The scent of a hyena\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He searched the surroundings of the lake but did not find any trace of the little elephant and the others.

At this moment, furious roars suddenly came from the bushes not far away.

They were the roars of the Chino brothers\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately ran over.

When he left, the Chino brothers and the jackal couple came to this forest to find prey.

Doya and the little elephant stayed by the lake.

Now, so much time had passed and they still had not returned. Clearly, something had happened.

Chu Xiaoye quickly ran into the bushes. What assaulted his nose was a strong smell of blood and those annoying smells.

The Chino brothers stood side by side, their bodies covered in wounds from being bitten.

Behind them stood the jackal couple and the elephant.

The jackals were not injured.

The elephant's nose and legs were dripping with blood.

Doya sat on its back, trembling in fear.

Around them were about twenty spotted hyenas.

These spotted hyenas were generally tall and strong. They were not inferior to the female lions on the grassland over there.

On their heads were small clumps of white fur that looked different from the spotted hyenas over there.

The fangs they bared were exceptionally thick and sharp, looking even more ferocious\!

Chu Xiaoye's appearance excited the Chino brothers, but the white-haired hyenas did not even take another look at him.

They relied on their numerical advantage and were not even afraid of adult lions. Why would they be afraid of this cub without a mane?

Only two spotted hyenas walked over and prepared to deal with Chu Xiaoye.

The other hyenas were still gathered there.

Their goal was not the Chino brothers, but the little elephant behind them.

Any carnivore would drool when they saw such a big piece of meat, let alone a large group of hyenas that were never picky about food.

The two hyenas that were walking towards Chu Xiaoye had cold and contemptuous gazes. Without any hesitation, they quickened their steps and pounced on him.

However, what greeted them were two heavy slaps\!

"Bang\! Bang\!"

They had just pounced close when Chu Xiaoye almost stood in place without moving. He raised his feet and slapped them on their faces, one on the left and one on the right\!

The two spotted hyenas tilted their heads and flew to the side. They fell heavily to the ground and could not get up for a long time.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at them again and continued to walk forward.

The other hyenas finally came to their senses when they saw this scene.

More hyenas rushed over and swarmed over, fierce and united\!

They did not seem to be afraid, nor did they think of letting the other companions attack first. Instead, they fought to be the first, not afraid of death, like brave warriors\!

When Chu Xiaoye slapped away two more hyenas, his thigh and back were immediately bitten by the other hyenas that pounced on him\!

More hyenas pounced ferociously\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and stepped on the backs of a few spotted hyenas, jumping out of their encirclement. With a whoosh, he ran towards a spotted hyena standing not far away\!

The hyena was clearly larger than the other hyenas.

Although it stood there without making a sound, its aura and the way the other hyenas looked at it indicated that it was the leader of the pack.

What was even more strange was that it was not a female hyena, but a male hyena.

Chu Xiaoye was very fast and arrived in front of it in the blink of an eye\!

However, it did not escape. Instead, it suddenly charged towards Chu Xiaoye\!

Just as Chu Xiaoye bared his fangs and was about to pounce on it, it suddenly jumped up and jumped over Chu Xiaoye's head, landing in front of the pursuing hyenas.

It turned around and stood there, looking coldly and calmly at the cub in front of it, like a general who had gone through hundreds of battles.

Chu Xiaoye missed and immediately turned around to look at it, his gaze grave.

This hyena leader was not simple\!

The twenty-over hyenas immediately abandoned attacking the brothers and the little elephant. They all rushed towards him.

Clearly, the hyena leader had realized that he was the true tough one here\!

The hyenas prepared to gather all their strength and kill him first\!

The hyenas looked very different from the hyenas over there.

The spotted hyenas there were timid by nature. As long as you bit one to death and revealed a little bit of strength, they would tremble in fear and shrink at the side, not daring to go forward easily.

They each had their own ulterior motives and hoped that their companions would go first. They seemed to be united, but they were really like a plate of loose sand.

The hyenas in front of him were like an orderly and obedient army.

They charged forward together, advanced and retreated together, worked together in an orderly manner, were brave and strong. Even their aura could give him quite a bit of pressure\!

They were a group of formidable enemies that could not be underestimated\!

When Chu Xiaoye saw them charging over ferociously, he did not face the enemy head-on like before. Instead, he immediately turned around and used his speed and agility to start attacking them one by one\!

He ran around the bushes and trees.

The hyenas, who had a neat formation, were immediately thrown into chaos.

Before the few hyenas at the front could react, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and slapped their mouths, causing their mouths to be filled with blood. Their teeth fell out and they fell to the ground.

Their fall caught the hyenas following closely behind off guard and they fell to the ground.

The formation became even more chaotic.

Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped in his tracks, turned around, and rushed up. He bit the neck of a spotted hyena and rushed out of the hyena pack before the other hyenas could react\!

The hyenas were furious. They immediately turned around and chased after him.

When Chu Xiaoye bit the hyena in his mouth to death, he gradually slowed down. When the hyenas behind him caught up to him and were about to pounce on him, he suddenly turned around and threw the hyena corpse in his mouth out\!

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

The few hyenas that were chasing the closest were caught off guard and tripped again.

Chu Xiaoye quickly circled around a bush and circled around to the side of their team. He rushed up again to bite a spotted hyena and turned to run\!

The hyenas were immediately angered by his teasing. They left the team and chased after him from all directions.

This way, the space inside was much larger.

Chu Xiaoye leaned in a direction and rushed in with a whoosh\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

A series of muffled sounds rang out among the hyena pack\!

The ferocious hyenas had yet to open their mouths to bite when they were sent flying\!

Chu Xiaoye became braver and braver. His body was hot and his feet were hot. His strength surged endlessly into his front limbs, making his movements even faster and more ferocious.

"Bang\!"

He slapped it and broke the entire jaw of a hyena, causing it to hang below its neck\!
