Chapter 587: Beast herd

His roar was like thunder and his killing intent surged\!

However, the battle ended too quickly and only lasted for dozens of seconds.

After two moves, Mixed Fur fell into a pool of blood.

He lay on the ground with his eyes wide in disbelief.

When this golden lion walked past him, he seemed to have suddenly thought of something and let out a painful whimper, but he could not scream anymore.

The violence subsided and the killing intent disappeared.

His pupils started to dilate and his thoughts returned to the grassland.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The quiet night immediately became noisy.

When the soldiers in the village heard the roar of the beast, they rushed over with their guns held.

Chu Xiaoye slapped open the iron door and walked into the garden that imprisoned the ferocious beasts.

His green eyes lit up in the darkness.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light. He saw the lion lying under the tree not far away, looking around in panic.

The cold father seemed to have sensed something and immediately stood up. He followed the gazes of the other ferocious beasts and looked at the door.

Looking at the huge and golden young lion at the door, he was stunned. For a moment, he could not recognize it.

"Roar—"

A few ferocious beasts with dinosaur genes suddenly rushed out of the darkness and pounced at Chu Xiaoye.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws and slapped them away.

At this moment, the ferocious beasts imprisoned here all walked out of the darkness. The cries and gunshots of humans were getting closer and closer.

Chu Xiaoye turned around, raised his claws, and slapped the wall.

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily, his roar breaking through the night and spreading into the distance.

The hundred-over ferocious beasts hiding outside the village immediately jumped up from the dense grass and roared as they rushed into the village.

The crowd that had come out of the village to watch the fun immediately screamed and fled in fear.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the cold father and the other ferocious beasts.

The cold father finally recognized him\!

"Roar —"

He roared hoarsely, and tears flowed from his old eyes. He ignored his father's reservedness and dignity and immediately rushed over, as if he was crying. "Unfilial son\! You're finally here\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not make small talk with him. He immediately turned around and ran out with him.

When the other ferocious beasts saw this, they no longer hesitated. They roared and rushed out of the darkness, following behind them and charging out of the village.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The human soldiers rushed over and cursed as they fired.

Chu Xiaoye blocked in front of the cold father and rushed towards the soldiers who had fired.

That was the only path\!

Because of the previous riot, the defense here was definitely tight. Many traps and trap traps must have been set on the ground elsewhere. Only the place where these human soldiers ran over was the safest\!

Chu Xiaoye's huge body became the most striking target. The bullets of the human soldiers shot at him.

His golden hair stood on end and his skin condensed into a black armor. He suddenly pushed the few soldiers at the front to the ground and killed them with his claws\!

More soldiers rushed over with submachine guns, AKs, and even armor-piercing bullets.

"Roar—"

A huge roar suddenly came from Chu Xiaoye's mouth\!

Like an explosion, it sounded in the ears of these human soldiers and instantly shattered their eardrums, causing their vision to turn black and they fell to the ground\!

In front of Chu Xiaoye, a visible air wave surged out like a tide and pushed the human soldiers at the front\!

Chu Xiaoye brought the cold father and the ferocious beast pack and ran out of the fallen crowd majestically.

Before the soldiers hiding at the back and preparing to attack with cannonballs could prepare, the hundred-over ferocious beasts that attacked from outside the village immediately roared and rushed out, pouncing on them.

"Boom\!"

A cannonball flew out and exploded in front of Chu Xiaoye, causing the houses on both sides to collapse.

In the flames and dust that filled the sky, Chu Xiaoye rushed out with the ferocious beasts and rushed towards the human soldiers.

The massacre started.

The women and children, the humans who did not have guns, fled in fear.

The soldiers started to resist heroically at first, and the number of ferocious beasts in front of them increased. Even the ferocious beasts that they had injected with genes started to change sides and could only flee in panic.

Soon, the entire village was dyed red with blood.

Flames surged into the sky and miserable cries lingered.

These humans probably never would have thought that these animals that they had once slaughtered and enslaved would actually kill them on this day.

The animals' eyes were red from killing and they were stimulated by the blood to go crazy. They vented all their hatred and anger on these humans.

In the distance, lights flickered.

The nearby villages received the news and sent soldiers to run over with heavy weapons.

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and left the village with the cold father.

More than 200 ferocious beasts followed behind them.

The remaining ferocious beasts had already fallen into madness and were unwilling to leave. They were still chasing after the terrified humans everywhere.

"Bang bang bang\!"

machine guns sounded and groups of roaring ferocious beasts fell to the ground.

When the humans pulled away and the weapons in their hands started to spit out sparks without obstruction, no matter how fierce these ferocious beasts were, they could only die.

Soon, the remaining humans turned the tables.

The ferocious beasts with bloodshot eyes fell one by one.

When a truck full of soldiers galloped over, the ferocious beast that was still in the village suddenly became a turtle in a jar and could not escape.

When they discovered the danger and prepared to rush out, what awaited them was a terrifying tongue of fire.

Chu Xiaoye ran to the distant grassland with more than 200 ferocious beasts.

At this moment, the sky was starting to brighten.

The ferocious beasts obtained freedom, but for a moment, they did not know where to go.

This grassland had long become a place for humans to play and hunt. It was out today, but what about tomorrow?

They looked at the huge golden figure and tacitly surrounded him, unwilling to leave.

Chu Xiaoye walked to the side of the cold father. Seeing that he was not injured, he growled and asked about Mei Mei's whereabouts.

The cold father only knew that Mei Mei had been brought away by another group of people and did not know where she went.

When father and son met, they did not speak much.

Chu Xiaoye told him the direction where Little Curly Tail and the others left in and let him bring this group of ferocious beasts to follow the steps of the pride and go to the new grassland.

The cold father did not leave.

He firmly expressed that he wanted to stay and save Mei Mei with him.

The two hundred plus ferocious beasts also stared at him intently.

Wherever he went, they went.

Chu Xiaoye looked at these wandering and helpless ferocious beasts and then at the grassland that was wantonly trampled by humans. He suddenly felt that he should do something.

Although he could not change the destruction of the world, he could at least try his best to let the animals on this grassland survive.

While saving Mei Mei, he could save more animals.

The group of ferocious beasts in front of him might be a force that would make the enemy tremble\!

At the same time.

In the forest dozens of kilometers away, a super pride formed by about three hundred lionesses and young cubs was rushing towards the grassland.

Lars, who had already grown a thick black mane on his neck and had become even taller, walked in front of the team.

A few kilometers behind these prides, there were more animals that formed a majestic beast pack and were migrating towards the grassland here.

The grassland had already fallen. In order to survive, they had new soil.
