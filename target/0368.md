Chapter 368: Untitled

The sky was dark and the rain was light.

The members of the pride did their jobs and did their own things. They did not slack because of the weather.

The Chino brothers, who wanted to be lazy, were also chased out by the sisters. They braved the rain to mark the territory.

As the king of the pride, Chu Xiaoye should have been lying leisurely in the bushes to hide from the rain and rest. He should have been thinking about this damn lion's life in boredom, eating and waiting for death.

However, he was not idle.

He and Catherine broke branches in the bushes and transported them to the thickest Baobab tree to build a lion's nest.

For lions, the difficulty of building huts was too high. They could only take a step back and build the storage room like before.

This time, he could build it a little larger and put some big leaves on it and thick animal fur on it. This way, it could become a dry and warm nest that blocked the wind and rain.

Under Blue's orders, the Belita sisters also came to help.

When the little girl woke up, it was already noon.

The rain in the sky was still dripping and did not show any signs of stopping.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the Baobab tree and looked at the river outside the bushes worriedly. If the rain did not stop, the river would definitely rise like before and spread ashore to drown the bushes.

At that time, they would have to migrate again.

The female lions returned with their prey. There were a total of five gazelles, and one of them was a small gazelle. They had already stopped breathing.

Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, and the others would hunt by themselves. Furthermore, their hunting skills were much better than that of female lions. Therefore, they did not need to eat the prey brought back by the female lions. Otherwise, with their terrifying appetite, even if these gazelles were larger, they would definitely not be enough to eat.

Chu Xiaoye ate one alone.

The other gazelles were freely allocated.

Tilly had been sleeping a lot these few days. She slept at night and during the day. Even delicious food could not tempt her. No one knew if she was really tired or if she was too lazy to move.

Catherine tore off a gazelle leg, brought it to the tree, and hung it in front of her.

She only opened her eyes to look for a moment before closing them again and continuing to sleep.

Chu Xiaoye specifically left the gazelle behind. After eating, he walked to the gazelle's side and used his sharp golden claws to carefully tear off its fur. Then, he washed the fur in the waterhole and hung it on the tree.

The dripping rain continued to wash the smell and the remaining blood on it.

Although the gazelle's fur was short, it was very soft and warm. It could block the cold air blowing from the sea very well.

Although this fur was from the gazelle, the little gazelle here was not small and was much larger than the little girl's body. If the little girl wore the gazelle's fur, it could wrap around her entire body.

When peeling the skin, Chu Xiaoye made a horizontal cut at the neck and a vertical cut from the abdomen. He carefully peeled it off bit by bit and removed the fur on the two hind legs, causing the gazelle skin to look like a long and wide leather coat.

There was a hat and a top. It could even wrap the girl's lower body.

However, she still needed a pair of pants.

Chu Xiaoye peeled off the back half of the fur of the other adult gazelle, as well as the fur on the two hind legs. Then, according to the little girl's size, he trimmed it into a tight pair of pants.

The little girl's slender legs could fit into the fur of the two deer legs.

There were long pants and a leather shirt. But she was still missing a pair of waterproof boots.

However, the gazelle's hooves were not suitable.

Therefore, the matter of making boots could only be delayed.

After Chu Xiaoye trimmed these things with his claws and teeth, he washed them again and hung them on the tree to let the rain continue to wash them.

He was so busy making these strange things that even Catherine did not know what he was doing.

When Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei returned, they were very curious about these little things. They wanted to go up and play with them, but their eyes were watery from Chu Xiaoye's merciless slaps.

Chu Xiaoye let them pick flexible branches and transport them to make nests.

It was similar to when he made the storage room back then. However, this time, the space had to be larger. Some fur and leaves to prevent rain had to be placed on it. The surroundings and below had to be wrapped in animal fur to resist the cold wind.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly helped transport the materials.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, they were busy building on the tree.

A day passed in the blink of an eye.

The little girl had already woken up at noon, but she had been following behind the pair of cute violent bears and looking for something to eat in the bushes.

She felt that she should find food independently and not always wait for the pride to share. If that happened, she would feel guilty and feel that she was useless.

Even if the king did not say anything, the other members of the pride would probably have thoughts in their hearts.

The pride would not raise a little trash for nothing.

The cute violent bear and her son were omnivores. They ate whatever they encountered along the way. Flowers, plant roots, small insects, and even some small animals. The little girl did not know how to eat these.

Until they walked into an orchard and a few golden fruits fell from the tree.

The little girl tasted the fruit and it was sour and sweet. But she was very happy.

She raised her head and thanked the Belita sisters on the tree. She said strange words and waved her little hand, smiling brightly.

Belita and the Belia sisters also mimicked her and grinned, but they were a little ferocious and ugly.

The rain continued to fall.

After the little girl ate a few fruits, although she ate some food, she felt even colder.

She regretted throwing away the thick fur on the way, but if she had not done so, she would have fallen behind.

The rain was cold and the wind was cold.

The little girl shivered and crawled into a bush with lush leaves with her white and delicate feet bare. Her dress was already drenched and her golden hair was dripping with rain.

The sky turned dark.

She curled up and hugged her knees, squatting inside. Through the gap in the bushes, she stared blankly at the endless rain outside.

Perhaps she remembered how she had stood in front of the window at home when it rained, enjoying the heat and delicious food. She looked at the rain outside the window and talked to her parents excitedly. Her young face could not help but show a happy smile.

After the sky turned dark, the temperature suddenly fell even lower.

No one knew where the cute violent bear and her son went.

The little girl's lips were dark and she was so cold that she curled into a ball. Her thin and wet white dress stuck to her skin and gave her more coldness.

Suddenly, the bushes beside her moved. A terrifying face and a lion head with a scarf popped in and looked at her with bright eyes.

The little girl squeezed out a smile and used her small hand to tidy the golden hair stuck to her face. Her small body trembled and she said sweetly, "You're here."

Chu Xiaoye stared at her for a few seconds, then crawled in and lay beside her. He wrapped his claws around her body and let her lean into his arms and thick mane.

The little girl buried her face in his increasingly lush mane and finally felt a trace of warmth.

Outside the bushes, the rain was still dripping and invading the dream.

The little girl soon fell asleep. The corner of her mouth curled up slightly and she stuck close to his body, as if she had a beautiful dream.

Catherine was drenched in the rain. She squatted under the tree outside and guarded silently.
