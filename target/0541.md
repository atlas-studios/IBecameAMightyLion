Chapter 541: The Smart Doya

Mormont was very prestigious.

In this ancient and rich city, his virtue and prestige were enjoyed and prided by every citizen and soldier.

The citizens and soldiers of the city supported him sincerely.

Therefore, even if he was imprisoned in the cell, he could still command the army outside through some means.

However, he was afraid that the citizens of Bingluo City would be implicated.

After all, the Lusni family had a 50,000-strong army and were all good killers.

If he dared to move, the people in this city would definitely suffer.

However, the situation seemed to be improving now.

Out of the fifty thousand troops of the Lusni family, only five thousand were left in the city.

Although these five thousand troops occupied the most advantageous position and held the most powerful wave of people hostage, the soldiers and citizens of Bingluo City were definitely not to be trifled with.

Now, he only needed this well-respected old man to make up his mind.

"Lord Mormont, this is a rare opportunity and it's too late to lose it\! With your prestige, as long as you wave your arms, the five thousand soldiers left behind by the Lusni family are not enough."

Chu Xiaoye kept persuading him.

Mormont stood in the cell, his back still straight. He said worriedly, "Cesar's army might return at any time. I can't risk the citizens of the city. What they want is money. I'll give it to them."

Chu Xiaoye revealed his cards to him and said, "The big army that the Lusni family sent out might not return. Princess Carter has long seen through their scheme. I'm afraid that they have already ambushed on the way. If Lord Mormont still hesitates, when the big army is defeated and if they flee back to the city in a sorry state, they will definitely force your citizens and soldiers to fight. Furthermore, if he wants to guard the city, this ancient city will definitely be tortured by his soldiers until it's on the verge of death. In his extreme anger and despair, does Lord Mormont hope that those fellows who betrayed and attacked this city will treat you well?"

Mormont looked at him and said, "If Princess Carter had long seen through Cesar's trick, why did you fall out?"

Chu Xiaoye felt that this old man might be old. His previous intelligence and intelligence were useless now.

This was a very obvious scheme within a scheme. Was there a need to ask?

Of course, his falling out with Carter was not entirely a scheme that he had long planned.

For example, Carter suddenly killing the girl named Doya was outside of the plan. Chu Xiaoye was really angry and really had a falling out with her back then.

"Grandpa, do you still not understand? This is a scheme that the princess and Lord Night had long set up to deliberately deceive Cesar."

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to explain, the girl named Doya whispered to the old man.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in surprise.

The girl looked at him and continued, "Lord Night must have deliberately wanted to enter the city with us. He also expected the current situation. He's preparing to think of a way to convince you to raise your troops and resist, close the city gate, and completely cut off the path for Cesar to return. At that time, Cesar's 45,000-strong army will be at a dead end. They will either surrender and be taken in by the princess or die in battle."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but raise his thumb and praise sincerely, "Smart\!"

It seemed that the reason why this city survived for so long was not because of how powerful this old man was, but because he had many powerful descendants.

His sons were now trapped in the castle and forced to continue operating everything in this city for Cesar, but they were definitely thinking of ways to save this old man.

One was in the castle and the other in the prison. They did not dare to act rashly because they were afraid of the other party's life.

Therefore, this old man had to make a decision quickly.

"Grandpa, let Luha bring the word out. We only need to mobilize the army and take down a few leaders of the 5,000-strong Lusni army. Under the absolute advantage of military strength, the remaining will definitely surrender. You don't have to worry about father and the others. The guards in the castle will protect them to the death. As for the citizens, at most, they will cause some chaos. Our army is not that weak."

Doya persuaded softly.

Chu Xiaoye thought even more highly of this girl. She was simply a talent. Fortunately, she was not killed by Alisa.

Mormont looked at the girl and the other juniors and still said worriedly, "What about you? There are at least 500 people guarding this cell. At that time, they will probably surge in angrily to hurt you. Doya, I don't like my granddaughter and grandson dying because of my risk."

Doya looked at Chu Xiaoye and said softly, "Grandpa, since Lord Night said so, he definitely has a way to protect us. At least, they will help us delay long enough for our guards to rush over."

"Miss Doya is indeed smart\!"

Chu Xiaoye reached out and broke open the two thick iron bars in front of him. He walked out of the cell and said, "Lord Mormont, we will close the cell door and stop the soldiers of Lusni from charging in to kill."

"Dogshit\! How did you come out?"

Right at this moment, a Lusni soldier discovered him.

However, just as the soldier was about to sound the alarm, Denise's arrow had already shot out and pierced into his throat\!

"Look\! We even stole our weapons back."

Chu Xiaoye said proudly.

A few female elves walked out of the cell with weapons that had been confiscated.

The weapons were originally placed on the table at the door. Now, they actually took them all back secretly.

Furthermore, the ten-over Lusni soldiers guarding the cell actually did not have any reaction.

When Chu Xiaoye broke open the prison opposite and let Mormont and his juniors out, they realized that the ten-over Losni soldiers had actually fallen to the ground. Their stomachs were broken and their intestines and blood flowed all over the ground\!

At the same time, a female lion stood at the door of the cell like a door god.

"What's wrong inside?"

The voices of the Lusni soldiers suddenly came from outside.

"Close the door\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed up with Vilis and quickly closed the cell door.

At this moment, the girl named Doya said, "Lord… Lord Night, you seem to have forgotten something important."

Chu Xiaoye asked in confusion, "What is it?"

Doya did not know whether to laugh or cry. She said, "My grandfather hasn't agreed yet. Furthermore, his orders have not been brought out by Luha."

Chu Xiaoye :"…"

Mormont stood outside the cell in a daze. Was this forcing him to resist?

Chu Xiaoye could only look at the old man and say, "Lord Mormont, it's too late to resist now that the matter has reached this point. Listen, the Lusni soldiers outside have rushed in and are preparing to break in and kill your cute grandchildren."

The old man shrugged and rolled his eyes like a child. "I'm afraid that the person they want to kill the most should be you, a bad kid."

At this moment, the arrow was already on the bow and he had no choice but to attack.

Although the old man was still worried that Cesar would return with the army, he could not hesitate anymore.

"Doya, tell Luha to take action."

The old man said to his favorite granddaughter.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was wondering how they were going to tell Luha, the girl called Doya suddenly walked under a vent and meowed outside. Then, the outside immediately responded, "Meow—"

Luha was actually a cat\!
