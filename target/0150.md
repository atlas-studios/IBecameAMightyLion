Chapter 150: The Roar of the King\!

The little elephant was still lowering its head to eat and did not notice.

When the other green vine monsters saw this scene, they hurriedly circled around this dangerous place. They could only continue to close the encirclement from other directions.

When a green vine with the smell of blood quietly moved behind Chu Xiaoye and was about to attack, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around without warning and slapped its head\!

"Eh?"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up in shock.

He thought that it was a carnivore like a wild wolf or fox, but he did not expect it to be a green vine.

However, this green vine did not seem to be simple\!

After the green vine was slapped by him, it immediately rolled on the ground. The long body dragging behind distorted and swayed violently.

The moment it raised its head, two rows of sharp fangs were revealed\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. Just as he was about to go forward and slap it again, he suddenly realized that more thick green vines had appeared on the ground behind it and were crawling over quickly\!

"Squeak —"

Right at this moment, a monkey on the tree suddenly let out a terrified and sharp cry\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw a green vine climbing up the tree and wrapping around the monkey's body. It opened its bloody mouth and bit the monkey's face\!

The other monkeys on the tree were terrified and screamed\!

The little animals on the ground finally woke up from the temptation of delicious food. They looked at the fast-moving green vines behind them and let out terrified cries as they fled in a panic\!

However, there were these green vine monsters everywhere\!

The green vine monsters wrapped around the bodies of the little animals that were preparing to escape and bit their throats or heads\!

The other small animals immediately panicked and could only run towards the middle of the orchard in fear\!

The green vines around him no longer hid. They rustled and started to move quickly\!

Chu Xiaoye realized that, be it the ground or the trees, they were filled with these green vine monsters at some point in time\!

At this moment, the few of them were surrounded like the little animals\!

The dozens of monkeys on the tree also jumped down the fruit tree in a hurry and retreated to the middle of the orchard with the little animals on the ground.

However, they had nowhere to run\!

Chu Xiaoye's scalp turned numb when he saw that there were more and more green vine monsters around him. He could only retreat to the side of the little animals with the Chino brothers and Doya.

The little animals were not afraid of them. Instead, they looked at the green vine monsters on the ground and fruit trees around them and shivered\!

In their eyes, these things would eat their meat and drink their blood.

The little elephant only realized later and was still eating the fruits on the ground. By the time it discovered these green vine monsters, it had already been divided into another area alone.

However, there were no green vines preparing to attack it around it.

The terrifying monsters circled around it not far away and crawled towards the middle, as if they did not see it.

The little elephant was stunned for a moment and was furious. It raised its nose and its four legs flew, causing the ground to rumble. It trampled on the green vine monsters and ran to Chu Xiaoye's side.

The monsters that it stepped on all stopped in place and twisted and swayed, looking extremely in pain. They could not climb over anymore.

When Chu Xiaoye saw this scene, he immediately let it put Doya on its back and prepare to break out.

The green vine monsters wrapped around the fruit tree above him finally revealed their true appearance\!

They lowered their heads and spat out scarlet tongues. A sharp horn that was as sharp as a blade appeared on their foreheads. Their mouths were full of teeth, and they were thin and dense. They were actually quite similar to the teeth of a piranha\!

Their bodies merged with the green vines. Their scales were covered in green leaves, and their true length could not be seen at all\!

They looked extremely similar to pythons, but they were not as fast as pythons. They crawled very slowly and were not very agile. Their movements and speed only seemed to increase when they wrapped around objects.

However, other than possessing the ability to kill pythons, they also had a bloody mouth full of fangs and sharp horns and they were even stronger than pythons\!

From the current situation, their ambushing ability and teamwork were also extremely superb.

Silently, they surrounded the small animals eating in the orchard.

What kind of monster was this?

Seeing that their encirclement was getting smaller and smaller, the bloody mouths full of fangs above their heads were hanging down as the little animals trapped here all cowered tightly, terrified.

Chu Xiaoye knew that if he did not escape now, he would never be able to escape when they surrounded him\!

With so many thick and long bodies wrapped around them densely, even a super elephant had to obediently kneel down\!

Therefore, he immediately brought the little elephant and the Chino brothers to the front of this group of small animals and prepared to charge and break out\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly turned around and roared at the trembling little animals behind him who could barely stand up. He gestured for them to pull themselves together and follow behind him to charge out\!

Among these small animals were white rabbits, squirrels, monkeys, a few deer with long horns, a group of giant forest pigs, and a jackal couple who were preparing to ambush these small animals.

At this moment, they were all terrified.

Under Chu Xiaoye's roar, their bodies trembled in fear as they looked at him in a daze.

It seemed that only the jackal couple knew this future king of the grassland.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate anymore. He immediately stood in front of him and gestured to the little elephant and the Chino brothers to stand behind him one on the left and one on the right, form a cone-shaped formation like a spear and prepare to sprint\!

Although the little elephant's legs were strong and powerful, its reaction speed was not as fast as his. Once its legs were wrapped around by the green vine monsters and it tripped on the ground, it would never be able to stand up again\!

Therefore, he was still in charge of the spear tip\!

His slightly hot palms flowed with strength that made him excited and confident\!

His chest was surging with blood and filled with fighting spirit\!

He was fearless\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared. His roar was like that of a king, shaking the forest and charging into the sky\!

The green vine monsters blocking the path ahead all trembled in indescribable fear\!

"Whoosh\!"

He brought the little elephant and the Chino brothers, turned into an unstoppable spear, and charged towards the green vine monsters with a magnificent aura\!

The terrified little animals behind him were all frozen in place, not knowing what to do.

Only when the jackal couple bravely followed did they wake up. They hurriedly jumped up and followed behind like a wave\!
