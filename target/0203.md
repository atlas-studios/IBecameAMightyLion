Chapter 203: Strange Encounter in the Snow Forest

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Just as they were about to fight, a series of splashes suddenly came from behind.

Then, a group of huge rhinoceroses with long, sharp horns stepped on the water majestically and ran over from behind with their four hooves flying.

Some stepped on the reefs, while others ran in the water.

The bodies of these rhinoceroses had evolved to be even larger and stronger. When they ran, they were like moving hills\!

The huge scar-faced lion king suddenly seemed to have become a child when compared to them.

In the blink of an eye, they had already arrived close\!

Such a collision force would make even the largest white lions retreat\!

When the scar-faced lion king saw this scene, it did not dare to hesitate and immediately fled with the pride.

The passageway was so narrow and those fellows were terrifyingly big. He did not want to be smashed into pieces and trampled into meat paste before he could make a move.

Chu Xiaoye and the other two did not dare to hesitate and immediately followed closely, running forward.

Water splashed everywhere behind them. Not only did the huge body and ferocious aura of the rhinoceroses give them a lot of pressure, even the killers hiding in the dark in the passageway, preparing to attack, cowered and did not dare to move.

These big fellows had always had a fiery temper and had thick skin and rough flesh. They were difficult to deal with even one, let alone a group.

Perhaps only the white lion army and the elephant herd could make them afraid.

On the grassland, these tall and strong fellows who liked to charge around were most afraid of elephants. Many of their companions had died at the hands of elephants.

Especially those male elephants in heat. They would often harass them forcefully and even climb on their bodies to break their spines. When they were bored, they would even forcefully play with them like toys and kill them.

Therefore, they were exceptionally obedient in front of elephants.

In front of other animals, even in front of lions with the king of the grassland, they were extremely arrogant. They would bump into you if they were not happy with you. Sometimes, they would not even let go of trees. Their tempers were not ordinary.

With the mutation, they were now larger and stronger. In this narrow passageway, they were naturally invincible and no one dared to stop them.

Under their pursuit, the two prides did not dare to stop and ran.

After an unknown period of time, when the pride of the scar-faced lion king was panting from exhaustion and could not hold on any longer, a cold aura suddenly blew from the passageway in front of them.

Then, the light gradually brightened.

The scar-faced lion king immediately perked up and continued running with the pride.

Not long after, the light in front became brighter and brighter. Then, the exit of the cave appeared\!

In one go, they immediately rushed out of the cave.

An even colder aura immediately assaulted him\!

The scar-faced lion king with a thick mane could not help but shiver.

There were mountain ranges covered in snow and ice all around. Looking across, it was snow-white and crystalline, as if it was a world made of ice and jade.

This was not the end of the tunnel, but between the icebergs.

In the mountain range ahead, the black hole of the tunnel was still waiting for them.

However, they were too tired to take it. As soon as they came out of the cave, they ran towards the forest full of snow on the left.

Chu Xiaoye and the other two ran towards the forest on the right.

As soon as they came out, the rhinoceroses behind them swarmed out aggressively and did not stop. They stepped on the thick snow and ran into the tunnel in front of them, continuing to run forward.

Their speed and endurance had been enhanced.

This mission was clearly extremely urgent for them. That was why they were in such a hurry.

The scar-faced lions immediately heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that the terrifying fellows had already left. They lay on the snow in the forest, panting heavily as they closed their eyes to rest.

Chu Xiaoye and the other two were also resting in the forest on the right.

After running all the way, his stomach was rumbling with hunger.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to go to the snow forest at the back to see if there was any prey, Catherine, who was beside him, had already left quickly before him.

The male leopard, Blue, also turned around and went to the snow forest on the other side.

He did not dare to hope that the prey caught by the female cub could be shared with him.

The little lioness clearly only had eyes for her king.

He could not afford to provoke them.

Chu Xiaoye stayed in place and looked at the snow forest opposite, vigilant of the scar-faced lions' sneak attack.

However, the other party was clearly too tired to stand up. They were all lying on the ground motionless.

When they rested, they would definitely be hungry again.

To animals, no matter how much hatred they had, it was not as important as filling their stomachs.

They had brought many members this time and would need a lot of food. Therefore, before entering the next tunnel, they had to go to the snow forest to catch a few prey and fill their stomachs.

As for coming to find trouble, they clearly did not have the energy for the time being.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the cold snow and looked at the snow around him. The short fur on his body was not enough to resist the cold here and his entire body was cold.

Just as he was thinking about something, a low growl suddenly came from the snow forest behind him.

That was the direction Catherine left in.

Chu Xiaoye immediately got up and ran over while stepping on the thick snow.

In the forest ahead, a huge white bear was standing upright and roaring angrily while looking up at Catherine on the tree.

Catherine crawled on the tree covered in snow and looked a little sorry.

Obviously, the little lioness had never seen this animal and thought that it was like a water buffalo. Although it was huge, it was a stupid herbivore. Therefore, she prepared to go up and kill it.

In the end, he realized that the other party was a ferocious and terrifying carnivore.

It seemed that the two sides had already fought.

Catherine squatted on the tree and lowered her head to look at Chu Xiaoye. She was clearly confused and did not know what this big fellow was. Not only were its claws sharp and strong, but it also had sharp fangs in its mouth. The most terrifying thing was that this fellow could even stand upright and become even taller and stronger.

Chu Xiaoye was naturally shocked to see this white bear.

This snow-white and huge white bear looked like a polar bear, but it was much larger than a polar bear. Clearly, it was a mutated species.

The snow mountains here were most suitable for such fellows with thick fur and snow-white bodies to survive. The surrounding snow was their natural disguise. Their strong strength and sharp claws made them almost invincible here.

The thick snow on the ground did not affect their running.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, although they were very fast and strong, that only applied when they were on the grassland.

On this snow-covered mountain, it was difficult for them to run, let alone fight. Once their short legs sank into the deeper snow, their entire bodies would sink. How could they fight?

Therefore, after a short fight, Catherine had no choice but to climb up the tree.

She really could not provoke this violent big fellow here.

The white bear straightened its body and roared a few more times. Its front legs landed on the ground and it turned around to look at Chu Xiaoye. Its nostrils contracted violently, and it was obvious that it was still furious.

This female cub actually wanted to attack it just now. It was courting death\!

Was this little lion also here to have designs on it?

He was courting death\!

"Roar â€”"

It immediately roared angrily and pounced at Chu Xiaoye\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and climbed onto a big tree beside him. Using the hard tree as a springboard, he pounced over with a whoosh\!

"Bang\!"

He suddenly slapped the white bear's face, but he did not land on all fours. Instead, he twisted his body and landed on his back. After rolling a few times on the snow, he jumped up and jumped onto another tree.

In this way, he could prevent his four legs from suddenly sinking into the snow and being unable to pull them out when he fell.

The white bear tilted its head from the slap and immediately changed the direction of its sprint. With a bang, it fell into the snow.

Its huge body smashed a huge hole in the thick snow.

However, after being slapped heavily by Chu Xiaoye, it was not injured at all. It immediately got up again, stood up, and roared angrily.

Chu Xiaoye crawled at the root and extended his claws, hooking them at it as if he was provoking it. "Big Bear, come over and continue\!"

"Roar â€”"

The white bear immediately opened its mouth and roared angrily. Then, it got down on all fours and rushed towards him crazily\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at it with a burning gaze. Only when it was about to rush close did he jump up from the roots of the tree with a whoosh and jump onto its back.

Just as he raised his claws and was about to scratch the white bear's butt, he heard a muffled bang. The white bear's head actually hit the root of the big tree heavily\!

Then, it raised its head, and its two eyes turned into cross eyes. It was stunned for a moment before its body tilted. With a bang, it fell to the ground and fainted.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up from its back and looked at its miserable appearance with its head full of blood. The corner of his mouth twitched non-stop.

This stupid bear was even more stupid than Big Bear.

Catherine jumped down from the tree and stepped deeply on the thick snow. She walked over and extended her claws, preparing to open this white bear's stomach.

Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped her.

It was not easy for this white bear to grow so big.

Furthermore, this was a carnivore. In order to resist the cold, and it was fat all over, he did not like to eat it.

He would go to the forest to look again.

If he really could not find it, he would eat its paws.

The snow on the ground was very thick. It was difficult to even walk, let alone hunt.

However, Catherine listened to him and immediately turned around to walk in front.

Soon, they heard the cry of a deer.

In the forest in front\!

Catherine immediately slowed down and approached silently.

Chu Xiaoye stepped on her footprints and looked at the forest in front of him.

A snow deer that was even stronger than a gnu appeared in the forest in front of him. It was raising its head and crying out. No one knew if it was attracting the opposite sex or warning the other competitors.

When he hid close, Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that not only were there strong antlers full of branches on the head of this snow deer, there was also a plant growing in the middle of the antelope\!

The plant had green leaves and two red fruits hanging on its fingers, like ripe saintess fruits\!

Chu Xiaoye stared blankly, finding it unbelievable.

He thought of a story.

A hunter went to the forest to hunt. When he returned in the evening, he saw a deer with plum blossoms, but there were no more bullets in his pocket. Hence, he stuffed a cherry core that had eaten the fruit into the barrel, aimed at the deer, and pulled the trigger.

The cherry core accurately hit the deer's head, but the deer shook its head and quickly fled.

Two years later.

When the hunter came to the forest to hunt again, he suddenly encountered a deer with a cherry tree on its head. The cherry tree was covered in red cherries.

Hence, the hunter fired.

The deer fell to the ground.

This time, not only did the hunter obtain prey, but he also ate delicious cherries.

Obviously, this story was fake.

However, anything was possible.

Perhaps the head of the snow deer in front of him was injured back then and a small bird happened to throw down the eaten core and smash it into its wound. Then, using its flesh as soil, it started to grow.

Then, they would bloom and bear fruits.

Back then, Chu Xiaoye had never thought that there would be a white lion in this world, let alone that carnivores and herbivores would form an alliance.

What was even more absurd was that he had actually become a lion.

Therefore, nothing in this world was impossible.

Sometimes, you just did not see it with your own eyes.

The snow deer with fruits on its head was still neighing. Clearly, it did not know that danger was approaching.

Catherine had already circled to the other side and prepared to attack from behind.

Only by hiding close could they suddenly attack.

In this snow-covered forest, their limbs could not compare to the slender limbs of this snow deer.

The long legs had the advantage here.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the tree beside him and immediately climbed up.

When Catherine lowered her body and approached 50 meters, she was suddenly discovered by the vigilant snow deer.

Even if they were looking for a mate, they had to be careful of the enemy.

The snow deer immediately swung its long legs and jumped lightly on the snow.

Catherine hurriedly jumped up to chase, but she fell into the deep snow. She even buried her head in it and struggled helplessly with her four legs.

The snow deer looked at it and immediately relaxed. It stopped in place.

It seemed to find it a little funny. It turned its head and said "in a daze" to Catherine, who was struggling in the deep snow, as if it was mocking her.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly flashed past its head\!

Chu Xiaoye used the surrounding trees to jump in front of it. Then, he jumped, opened his sharp teeth, and pounced on it\!

The snow deer panicked and ran away\!

However, it was already too late\!

Just as it jumped up, Chu Xiaoye pounced heavily on it from the side and knocked it into the snow\!

Before it could struggle up, Chu Xiaoye's sharp fangs immediately pierced into its muscles and locked its throat\!

The snow deer widened its eyes and struggled in fear.

The plant above him swayed on the snow. On the branch, two red fruits emitted a tempting fragrance and crawled into Chu Xiaoye's nose.
