Chapter 114: Trap

After dawn.

The cold father and the three female lions returned.

This time, they seemed to have been blessed by the heavens and actually caught a nest of warthogs.

After eating, they brought back two more.

When Maya saw this, she immediately rubbed against the cold father's body excitedly, fawning over him.

Then, she rubbed against the female lions to show her affection.

In the end, she got her wish and got a warthog.

Xi'er bit another warthog and looked at her daughter. She hesitated for a moment before walking in front of Chu Xiaoye and putting the warthog down.

The warthog had just landed on the ground when it actually jumped up. With a whoosh, it jumped towards the bushes at the back\!

It had been pretending to be dead all this time\!

However, before it could run far, Little Curly Tail suddenly swung his tail and slapped it, causing it to fall to the ground.

Mei Mei immediately pounced on it, bared her fangs, and prepared to bite it to death.

Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped her and bit the warthog's hind leg, breaking one of its hind legs\!

The warthog let out a miserable roar and crawled on the ground, not daring to move.

Chu Xiaoye ignored it and looked at the warthog Maya was holding.

The warthog was already dead.

Seeing him look over, Maya panicked and hurriedly started eating.

The two young cubs beside her also sniffed curiously and mimicked their mother, trying to bite with their teeth.

"Roarâ€”"

Little Curly Tail let out a low growl and took a few steps forward, staring at her coldly.

As long as his brother gave the order, he would immediately rush over and snatch the prey back\!

These fellows were really thick-skinned and ungrateful\!

If not for her brother protecting her and her children, she and her children would have died long ago\!

If not for the food their brother saved for them, they would have starved to death long ago\!

Now that they had caught prey, they actually only shared it with their brother. It was too much\!

All of them should belong to his brother\!

Maya heard his roar and saw him staring at her fiercely. She immediately shivered and stopped eating.

Her two children were still excitedly biting their prey with their thin and sharp teeth, looking excited.

The cold father only glanced at Little Curly Tail's threat and ignored it.

Xi'er and Callie were also silent.

Only Aisha walked over and rubbed his head gently, telling him not to mess around.

Little Curly Tail turned his head stubbornly and looked at his brother.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him. Instead, he bit the neck of the warthog and walked into the bushes at the back.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment before he immediately followed Mei Mei.

Catherine lay in the grass not far away and wanted to get up, but she realized that her entire body was in unbearable pain. Clearly, she had been slapped by the ferocious beast previously.

She needed to recuperate and could not help him anymore.

Looking at his retreating figure, she was secretly worried and afraid.

That ferocious beast was so terrifyingly strong and he did not have any claws. Could he deal with it?

Chu Xiaoye brought the warthog to the bushes behind Maya and placed the warthog on the ground.

The warthog continued to roar miserably, but it did not dare to get up. It was clearly frightened.

Little Curly Tail suddenly realized\!

Was his brother trying to use the cry of this prey to lure that terrifying enemy over?

As long as that enemy dares to come, all of us will pounce on it together and definitely bite it to death\!

Tsk tsk, Brother is so smart\!

You were almost as smart as me, Little Curly Tail\!

"Roar\!"

He ran in front of his brother and called out proudly, indicating that he had thought of this method too.

Then, he immediately bared his fangs and threatened the warthog with a fierce expression, wanting it to roar even louder.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the head and told him to scram.

Little Curly Tail hurriedly retreated with a wronged expression.

His brother must be jealous of his intelligence and felt that his intelligence was being threatened. That was why he was angry.

That must be it\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and reached out with his claws to fiddle with the ground in front of the warthog, looking like he was digging.

The warthog was very good at digging holes and could quickly dig a hole in the ground.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to use it as labor and let it help dig traps.

He had previously thought of making arrows.

However, it was a little troublesome to make and it was not convenient to use. He still needed to practice for a long time and it was a waste of time.

Now that he had this type of hole-digging divine weapon, he could completely create many traps nearby. They would be filled with sharp branches and wooden stakes, and he could even insert sharp arrows.

As long as that tiger fell in, it would definitely be utterly disappointed in itself\!

The warthog howled miserably for a while. Seeing that he was still using his claws to dig the ground, it seemed to slowly understand.

It lowered its head hesitantly and started to dig the ground with its sharp teeth and thick mouth.

Chu Xiaoye was delighted. He raised his claws and rubbed its head, signaling it to do well.

The warthog shivered in fear and immediately started digging with all its might.

Little Curly Tail stood at the side in a daze with a confused expression.

It seemed that he had guessed wrong.

His brother did not want this prey to scream.

However, what did digging mean? Was he afraid of the enemy and wanted to hide like a turtle?

Sigh, his brother was indeed not as smart as him.

However, since his brother wanted to do this, he would do it\!

He immediately walked over and eagerly dug the ground with his claws.

Unexpectedly, after digging a few times, Chu Xiaoye slapped him again and told him to scram.

Were lions' claws used to dig the ground?

No ambition\!

Chu Xiaoye asked Mei Mei to supervise the warthog's work here and not let it be lazy.

As for him, he called for Little Curly Tail to follow him and walk towards the territory of the Seno brothers' pride.

Seno's corpse was still lying there.

He had to go over as soon as possible and extract the long tendon on the lion king's back.

The tendons of this ferocious beast were extremely tough and elastic. They were the best material to make bowstrings.

He only needed to dry it before soaking it in the water. Then, he would use a rope wrapped in tree bark to wrap it in the middle. After repeatedly drenching and drying it, it would be a very powerful bowstring.

Although they were digging a trap, it might not work.

To be safe, he had to be prepared to make arrows.

The four sharp fangs in Seno's mouth were also very good weapons for fighting enemies and could be placed in traps.

To prevent future trouble and completely kill the ferocious tiger with abnormal strength, he had no choice but to destroy Seno's corpse.

He believed that the lion king would definitely understand him if he knew in the underworld.

After all, he wanted to take revenge for him.

Little Curly Tail followed behind him and was always vigilant of his surroundings. He was like a qualified bodyguard who was prepared to risk his life to protect his brother\!

He was his brother's claw\!
