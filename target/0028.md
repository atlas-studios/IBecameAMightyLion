Chapter 28: Killer in the Water\!

A month later.

The weather became even hotter.

During this time, not a drop of rain fell.

Looking across the land, the grassland was already withered.

Except for the forest that was still green.

In the pride camp, the leaves of the two Baobab trees also started to fall.

The herbivores who were once afraid of lions had no choice but to take the risk and go to the bushes to forage.

Some dangerous carnivores would often visit this lush forest to get some shade and catch prey.

Conflicts happened every now and then.

However, the lion did not have much energy to deal with these invaders.

As long as they were not too close to the pride's camp, the lion would pretend that he did not see anything and only occasionally chase them away to show his strength and status as a lord.

The food was abundant.

The pride could eat fresh meat almost every day.

The female lions and young cubs seemed to be very satisfied with this life.

The lioness Callie, who had once had her children killed by the baboon army, finally recovered from her sorrow and started to go into heat again.

The cold father always stayed with her.

Mei Mei, who was standing on the Baobab tree, immediately stopped practising every time she saw them mating. She raised her neck and widened her eyes, watching curiously.

As for Little Curly Tail, he could not care less about it.

Chu Xiaoye hung the baboon corpse that he had picked up previously on a branch of this big tree.

Now, it was dry and there was no smell of blood.

Perhaps it was because of the bee venom, but it did not decay when it was hanging on the tree previously, nor did it attract any bugs or predators.

As the blood and water in the corpse evaporated, the bee venom in it should have disappeared as well.

Chu Xiaoye knew how terrifying the dry season was and decided to store food in advance.

As for the poisonous bees in the bushes, their venom and the honey on their feet were the best preservatives.

Not only was the dried baboon hanging on the branch, but there were also two dried wild rabbits and a half of a fawn.

He caught the wild rabbits and fawn in the bushes himself.

Then, he took advantage of the night and, with the weaker vision of the poisonous bees, suddenly threw them beside the nest.

When the poisonous bees heard noise, they would immediately swarm out regardless of who it was and attack it with all their might.

Just like that, these two prey were well preserved.

The food now was more abundant.

Hence, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were not interested in the dry food on the tree.

What they did not know was that when the dry season arrived and food was scarce in the future, never mind these dry food, they would even wolf down a piece of rotten meat on the ground and fight to the death for it\!

In the evening.

The river at the foot of the hill became lively again.

Due to the hot and dry weather, the water provided by their food could not satisfy the animals on the grassland.

Be it carnivores or herbivores, they drank water there almost every day.

At the pride's camp.

The female lions lay in the shade of the bushes, feeling so hot that their mouths were dry. They wanted to go and drink some water to quench their thirst.

However, the lion and Callie had yet to return.

Lars and Gigi stood on the hill, looking eagerly at the river below and the animals drinking water, pacing impatiently.

They were also thirsty.

Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were still panting in the shade of the bushes, doing all sorts of strange actions.

There were no more leaves on the Baobab tree.

The sun was too strong during the day, so they could only go up at night.

When the sky was about to turn dark.

The lion and Callie finally returned together, looking very sweet and loving, like a newlywed couple.

Under the lead of the lion, the pride set off and walked down the hill to drink water from the river.

The lion was in front, and the lionesses were on the left and right, while the cubs were protected in the middle.

The herbivores by the river made way.

However, they did not run away. Instead, they walked to the river farther away to drink water.

They were too thirsty.

Furthermore, this was not where lions would hunt.

Even those cruel hyenas would not hunt easily here.

There were too many carnivores and large animals here. They were all in groups and were not to be trifled with.

Moreover, if they caused chaos, it was very possible that not only would they not be able to eat their prey, they might even be trampled to death.

Of course, there was only one exception.

"Whoosh\!"

Not far away, water suddenly splashed everywhere\!

Just as a zebra was lowering its head to drink water, a bloody mouth full of fangs suddenly popped out from the turbid and calm river water and bit its neck\!

Fortunately, the zebra was always vigilant. Before the bloody mouth could close, it suddenly jumped backwards and narrowly dodged it\!

The other animals drinking water at the side were all shocked. They jumped up and ran away in panic. They stood not far away and looked on in fear, but they did not leave.

Even if there was a risk of death, they still had to drink water.

To survive.

It was a two-meter-long crocodile covered in armor\!

It did not bite its prey and did not stay any longer. It slowly retreated into the river and sank, disappearing.

Perhaps, at a certain moment, it would suddenly appear in another direction without warning\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he looked at the river in front of him. The water was muddy and he could not see if there was such a terrifying thing hidden below.

He was a little afraid.

Mei Mei was also scared out of her wits. Even though she was very thirsty, she hesitated and did not dare to approach the river.

The lion looked over solemnly, then walked to the river, lowered its head without hesitation, and started to drink water.

The lion's mane was lush and flamboyant, causing him to look exceptionally mighty and domineering from the front\!

Ordinary animals did not dare to provoke him.

However, to crocodiles, as long as he was in the water, he could only be a younger brother no matter how mighty he was\!

Perhaps the lion was confident, or perhaps he wanted to show his courage in front of his wives and children, or perhaps he could sense that there were no crocodiles here.

Anyway, he drank very slowly and was very relaxed.

At least, that was how it looked.

The female lions were also a little afraid, but their thirst was too unbearable. They could only approach him carefully, walk to the river, and drink tensely.

Lars was already extremely thirsty. Although he was terrified, he had no choice but to lean over and lower his head.

A black thing that looked like a wooden stake slowly floated over from the middle of the river.

Little Curly Tail also gathered his courage and leaned over.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the river and saw the black object clearly, but he was not sure if it was a wooden stake or a killer.

However, would a wooden stake float towards them by itself?

Obviously not\!

"Roar\!"

He immediately issued an anxious alarm to the pride that was lowering their heads to drink water.

The lion raised its head and looked at him coldly and disdainfully. It ignored him and continued to lower its head to drink water.

He had been intimate with Callie for a long time, and he was extremely thirsty now.

At this moment.

The black object suddenly sank and disappeared.

When Mei Mei saw that everyone was drinking, she could not take it anymore. She hurriedly went over and drank greedily.

Seeing that the thing suddenly disappeared and was obviously hiding beneath the water, Chu Xiaoye was extremely anxious.
