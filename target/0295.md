Chapter 295: Mother and Daughter at Night

"Roar\!"

Tilly let out a prideful cry from her nose. Then, she jumped up another tree and quickly jumped into the depths of the bushes.

"I'll ignore you. I'll go play with Belita."

Chu Xiaoye watched as her agile figure quickly left with a strange expression.

The little lioness's roar and actions just now looked like a human girl twisting her head and raising her chin. She slanted her eyes and snorted.

Did he become a spirit?

Little Curly Tail hung on the tree and swayed with the wind, looking at him aggrieved.

When he looked over, Little Curly Tail immediately swung his tail and flew onto the tree trunk. Then, he quickly climbed down the tree and rushed towards Molly, roaring threateningly.

"Hurry up and leave\! It's time to patrol\!"

Seeing him charge over ferociously, Molly immediately ran out of the bushes.

Little Curly Tail chased behind her and deliberately let out a fierce roar. His tail hit the surrounding bushes with a crackling sound.

Unexpectedly, the cold father was hiding in the bushes looking at the stupid egg. Just as he stood up, he slapped him on the face with his tail.

"Roar—"

The cold father was furious. He bared his teeth and roared.

Aisha was shocked. She hurriedly ran over to persuade him, but she stopped in front of Little Curly Tail and told him not to stoop to his level.

However, her protection made the cold father lose face and become even more furious.

"Roar—"

The cold father roared even louder.

Little Curly Tail stopped in place and curled his tail. Through his mother, he bared his fangs at him.

"Why, Dad, do you still want to be beaten?"

The cold father's mouth twitched, but he bared his fangs and was not afraid.

"This King is the leader of more than 70 lions now. Why would I be afraid of your milky stench? Why would I be afraid of a little fool who hasn't even grown his mane and doesn't even know how to go into heat? If you have the ability, try me?"

Little Curly Tail circled around his mother and came in front of him, staring at him with a burning gaze.

The cold father was a little timid, but he was timid on the inside and still put on a brave front. He still glared angrily and bared his fangs with a fierce expression.

The father and son faced each other without giving in, looking ready to fight to the death at any time.

"Roar—"

Aisha could not persuade him. She could only raise her head and shout at Chu Xiaoye on the tree.

Only this eldest son could subdue them.

Chu Xiaoye originally could not be bothered with this matter. However, since his mother had instructed him, he had no choice but to interfere. Furthermore, Little Curly Tail was indeed in the wrong first.

He stood up and prepared to go down.

However, before he could do anything, Little Curly Tail immediately lowered his head and bent his two front legs, lying on the ground. He hurriedly apologized to his father respectfully.

At the same time, the cold father immediately turned around and left with a cold and arrogant expression.

"Unfilial son, I can't be bothered with you\!"

Little Curly Tail thought that his brother was going to beat him up, and the cold father thought that his unfilial son was going to help him beat him up.

A battle was resolved peacefully like this.

Chu Xiaoye yawned and continued to lie on the ground. He looked at the moonlight and thought about how painful this lion's life was.

In the depths of the bushes.

Tilly was playing with the Belita sisters in the orchard. Not only was her mood not affected, she seemed to be very happy.

On the grassland outside the bushes, Catherine walked alone at the border and patrolled absent-mindedly.

Suddenly, a faint roar came from the river in the distance.

Catherine pricked up her ears and listened carefully for a few seconds. She immediately ran over.

When she came close, she heard it clearly.

At the foot of the hill, there were the roars of lions and the cries of hyenas.

Catherine quickly came to the hill and looked down.

By the river, a female lion and her daughter were surrounded by a group of strong hyenas.

The lioness and her daughter's fur were messy and they had a few wounds on their bodies. Their stomachs were shriveled and their bodies were thin. Clearly, they had come wandering after a long journey.

Just as the spotted hyenas were about to pounce on her after testing her for a long time, Catherine immediately jumped down from the hill. With a whoosh, she rushed into the hyenas and swung her claws, opening the stomachs of two spotted hyenas\!

When the two spotted hyenas cried out and fell into a pool of blood, the other spotted hyenas reacted and immediately fled in all directions\!

Catherine looked at them coldly and did not chase after them. Instead, she walked in front of the lioness and her daughter. She stared at them for a while before signaling them to follow her.

Catherine walked up the hill.

The female lion and her daughter hesitated for a while before following. However, they staggered and swayed as if they were hungry.

Catherine stood on the hill and looked back at them. Then, she slowed down and walked towards the bushes.

Soon, Catherine brought the mother and daughter to the bushes.

The members of the pride of the cold father stood up.

Little Curly Tail and Molly also returned from outside and looked curiously at the mother and daughter pair.

During this period of time, wandering lions constantly fled from the grassland and joined their team, causing their team to become stronger and stronger.

Although the lioness and her daughter did not have much combat strength, they could stay and hunt for everyone. They could even help roar a few times in battle to boost their morale. They were still very useful.

Chu Xiaoye stood up from the tree and lowered his head, looking at Catherine in confusion.

The little lioness should know that the lions that wandered from the grassland would be handed over to Lars and One-eyed to distribute. Why did she bring this mother and daughter here?

Could it be that when she saw this mother-daughter pair, she thought of her and her mother in the past, so she wanted to leave them here and become members of the pride of the cold father?

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye climbed down from the tree and came in front of the mother and daughter pair, looking at them seriously.

The mother-daughter pair immediately lowered their heads and lay on the ground, trembling.

Chu Xiaoye was a little stunned. He raised his head and looked at the members of the pride of the cold father, his gaze stopping on the cold father.

At some point in time, the cold father had already returned. He stood silently between Callie and Maya, obedient and silent.

At this moment, the cold father was stunned for a moment when he saw him looking over. Then, he was delighted. Although this unfilial son was unfilial, he knew his limits. He was the true king of this pride\!

If he wanted to accept new members, he had to first obtain the permission of the lion king.

The cold father sized up the lioness and her daughter in front of him carefully.

The big lioness was not too old and was at most six years old. As for this female cub, she was at most one and a half years old, about the age of these two unfilial sons.

The pride of the cold father was thin now and there were too few new female lions. They indeed needed to expand their numbers.

He walked forward, raised his head, and looked dignified. He let out a low growl, indicating that he agreed to let them join.

The new lion naturally had to please the lion king first and lick his fur and wag her tail pitifully.

The lioness and her daughter were originally lying on the ground facing Chu Xiaoye. At this moment, when they heard his growl, they were clearly stunned for a moment. Then, they immediately changed directions and lay in front of him. They lowered their heads, respectful and grateful.

The cold father stood in place and stared at them coldly.

"Don't you know the rules? Come over and lick it\!"

Little Curly Tail, who was standing at the side, rolled his eyes in disdain.

The female lion and her daughter immediately stood up. Just as they were about to walk into the cold father, their bodies suddenly swayed a few times and they fell to the ground.

They were hungry.

The cold father looked at their shriveled stomachs and immediately turned around. He instructed Maya, who was behind him, to bring the food from the hole over.

When Chu Xiaoye used honey to make black lion jerky, he also made some beef jerky. For lions that were used to eating fresh meat, it was completely difficult to swallow. However, for the pride of the cold father, this was a life-saving thing.

They stored some in the cave.

Maya turned around and was about to go to the cave to take it when Catherine, who had left at some point, suddenly ran back from the grassland with a bloody hyena corpse in her mouth.

The hyenas' intestines and internal organs were hanging on the ground.

Catherine walked into the bushes and under many puzzled gazes, placed the hyena's corpse in front of the lioness and her daughter.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her with flickering eyes, then at the hyena corpse on the ground. He suddenly grinned.

The mother and daughter lay on the ground hungry. When they saw the hyena's corpse, they seemed to hesitate for a moment. They looked up and saw that everyone was looking at them. They immediately lowered their heads and started eating.

At this moment, the cold father, who was standing closest to her, suddenly roared angrily and glared at Maya.

"Didn't I tell you to get the meat? Why aren't you going yet? They just came and you're letting them eat this trash. Do you know that you're mistreating them?"

He did not dare to be angry at Catherine and could only roar at Maya. He also glared at Callie angrily, looking like a majestic lion king.

However, just as he stopped roaring, Catherine suddenly walked up and raised her claws. Before the female lion and her daughter could react, she suddenly pierced her claws into the abdomen of the female cub and cut open the stomach of the female cub that was eating the hyena's corpse\!

"Pfft—"

Blood sprayed out and sprayed on the cold father's face\!

The cold father's body trembled and his limbs turned limp. With a bang, he fell to the ground and peed his pants\!

This… This… This…

The other members of the pride of the cold father were shocked to see this sudden change and looked at her in shock.

Was the female cub crazy?

Even if she was dissatisfied with the cold father's attitude, she could just slap him. Why did he suddenly want to kill a pitiful lioness cub that had just joined the pride?

As for the lioness cub's mother, she was frozen there with her mouth full of blood. She did not move, as if she could not believe it.

"Chi\!"

Catherine retracted her bloody claws and raised her head, looking at her king nervously.

Indeed, her king did not show that expression of shock and disbelief to her like the other members, let alone be angry and hate her. Instead, he looked at the big lioness and let her continue.

Catherine's confidence increased and her heart was filled with sweetness. A cold glint flashed in her silver claws and she looked coldly at the lioness mother.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as the members of the pride of the cold father were extremely shocked and at a loss, the female lion that had been lying on the ground hungry and could not get up suddenly jumped up. With a whoosh, she actually pounced at Chu Xiaoye\!

Her movements were fierce and rapid, her gaze was cold, and her face was ferocious. In an instant, she turned from a pitiful and miserable mother to a fierce and powerful killer\!

At this moment, the cold father and the other members were completely frozen in place and could not react.
