Chapter 44: The Terrifying Cub\!

This was their enemy\!

They would never forget the scene of the three young cubs in the pride being killed by the baboons\!

He did not expect that this group of enemies would actually migrate here\!

Aisha and Xi'er looked at each other and saw the fear and panic in each other's eyes.

The lion was not here, and the other sisters were not.

Xi'er was seriously injured and could not fight.

If the baboons suddenly rushed over, how could they protect the children?

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

The baboons immediately discovered them\!

Indeed, under the roar of the baboon king, whose fur was the most glossy and smooth, the thirty plus baboons immediately roared and rushed over\!

They also recognized these lions\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail suddenly roared angrily and stood in front of his mother. He bared his fangs and revealed a fierce expression.

Aisha and Xi'er immediately roared and fought their enemies, their bodies trembling.

Xi'er no longer had the strength to fight, but she was protective and still looked the most ferocious\!

Mei Mei stood beside her. Although her eyes were filled with fear, they were also filled with determination.

Under the leadership of the baboon king, the thirty-plus baboons charged in front of the pride with a murderous aura and surrounded them, letting out ear-piercing roars.

In the river.

The crocodile hiding in the water quickly floated up. The crocodile not far away immediately swam over and gathered by the river, looking at them coldly.

Behind him were crocodiles and in front of him were baboons\!

Aisha and Xi'er's hearts were filled with despair.

Mei Mei's body also started to tremble.

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs and had a fierce gaze, looking like he was about to risk his life. However, the baboons forced him to slowly retreat revealed his current thoughts.

He was also very afraid.

He was indeed brave, but he was also afraid of death.

Faced with so many ferocious enemies who had left a deep psychological shadow in their hearts, how could he not be afraid?

On the riverbank not far away.

The other animals who were drinking water also looked over intently.

Would they be torn to pieces by the baboon army or would they retreat into the river and be devoured by the crocodiles for training their bones and meat?

These few pitiful lionesses and young cubs seemed to have only these two choices.

"Roar\!"

The strong baboon king roared angrily and started urging the army to sprint\!

The baboons immediately roared in unison, bared their fangs, and extended their sharp claws. They prepared to charge forward and start a massacre\!

"Whoosh—"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly rushed out from behind Little Curly Tail. It was like a bolt of lightning that was peerlessly fast\!

Then, he suddenly jumped up and passed by the baboons at the front. He pounced to the baboon king's side and bit its neck\!

Not only did the baboon king and its clansmen not react, but even the pride also did not react\!

After the baboon king's neck was bitten, Little Curly Tail saw that the figure that was as fast as lightning was his brother\!

It was too fast\!

Aisha and Xi'er's eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

The ear-piercing roars of the baboons immediately stopped and strangely quietened down\!

However\!

Before they could react, Chu Xiaoye picked up the baboon king and ran away\!

He rushed out of the baboon troop and ran towards the hill\!

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

The shocked baboons immediately woke up and roared as they chased after him. They were all furious and roared endlessly\!

Although Chu Xiaoye was biting a baboon king that was even bigger than him, his running speed was still terrifying\!

The crazy baboons chased after her with all their might, but they kept falling behind.

However, they did not fall too far.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate at all. He picked up the baboon king and ran towards the pride camp with the murderous baboon army\!

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

The lion and the three female lions, who were resting in the shadow of the bushes, immediately heard the furious roars of the baboons. They were shocked and hurriedly got up to see what was happening.

Soon, Chu Xiaoye entered their vision with the baboon king in his mouth.

Then, the thirty-over baboons bared their fangs and roared continuously. They followed him with a murderous aura and rushed over\!

At this moment, even the lion was terrified\!

"Roar\!"

The cold father did not hesitate and turned to run\!

Not only did he not save his son, he even abandoned his pregnant wife\!

The three female lions did not dare to stay any longer and immediately followed behind him, escaping towards the bushes at the back\!

Chu Xiaoye bit the baboon king and quickly chased after them.

The furious baboon army chased after Chu Xiaoye.

The lion panicked and ran into the orchard with the three female lions. He was furious with his daring son\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and stopped following them. Instead, he ran in another direction\!

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

The furious roars of the baboon army instantly shook the entire forest\!

On a big tree not far ahead, the leopard and her daughter were sleeping on a branch. When they heard the noise, they looked over and were shocked.

An angry baboon army was chasing after the despicable and terrifying cub and running over with a murderous aura\!

And in the cub's mouth was a large baboon\!

It was one thing for this daring brat to provoke an entire hyena pack alone, but now, he was provoking the baboons again\!

Was he tired of living?

The little leopard lowered its head and looked in shock at the despicable cub that was running as if it was flying\!

What a foodie\!

He had snatched her prey a few times back then and now, he was not afraid of death as he hunted baboons. After being chased to this extent, was he still unwilling to put down the prey in his mouth?

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly slowed down.

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

The baboons behind him immediately roared and pounced\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly swung his head and threw the baboon king in his mouth heavily into a nearby bush\!

Then, he ran as if he was flying again. With a whoosh, he jumped onto a big tree in front of him and quickly climbed up\!

"Buzz…"

The bushes shook violently, and the huge beehive hiding inside was shaking so much that it was about to fall\!

Then, a black mass of huge poisonous bees attacked angrily\!

At this moment\!

The group of similarly angry baboons happened to catch up to this patch of bushes\!

A few strong baboons even pounced into the bushes bravely to save the baboon king\!

The bee army was furious\!

The densely packed black poisonous bees were like a black cloud that instantly enveloped the running baboons with a murderous aura\!

"Buzz buzz buzz buzz…"

The baboons that had been roaring angrily just now were instantly in chaos. They cried out miserably as they scattered and fled in fear\!

However, the furious and ferocious poisonous bees would never let any moving creature that appeared near the nest escape\!

In the blink of an eye, more than ten running baboons fell to the ground and roared miserably, rolling around with all their might\!

The miserable cries of the thirty-over baboons rose and fell. They were ear-splitting and were even more terrifying than the angry roars earlier\!

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree, trembling in fear as he listened. He felt his blood run cold and did not dare to move.

The leopard and her daughter, who were crawling on the branch above him, were also terrified and terrified. They looked at him without daring to move.

This cub was so cunning and terrifying\!

They were going to be exterminated\!
