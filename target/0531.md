Chapter 531: The Former Lioness

Blood splashed and heads fell to the ground\!

In the tent, corpses soon covered the ground.

None of Mo Ya's fourteen guards were left alive.

Seeing that this young female general was so ruthless to her own people, the few female elves started to feel uneasy.

"Go out."

Carter sat down on the bench and instructed.

Ha'er bowed and brought the guards to escort the little elves out.

The female general suddenly pointed at the elf youth and said, "Stay."

Vilis immediately said, "Carter, he's mine\! If you're unwilling to accept this, come at me\!"

The moment that was said, the originally stunned Chu Xiaoye's expression changed and he immediately cursed inwardly.

The female general suddenly stood up from her seat, her eyes revealing a cold killing intent. Just as she was about to speak, Chu Xiaoye hurriedly turned around and glared at the huge sword loli. "Bullshit\! When did I become your person? Vilis, please scram\! I don't want to see you now\! I dislike seeing you\! You're short and fierce. You're not feminine at all\! You're so ugly\!"

"You\!"

Vilis glared and grabbed the sword hilt.

Lanisi immediately grabbed her hand and whispered, "Vilis, let's go out first."

The Queen seemed to have realized that this female general of the Kast did not want to hurt them or Night. However, if Vilis continued to provoke them, it might be possible.

"Scram\!"

Chu Xiaoye glared at the huge sword loli with a look of disdain.

Lanisi pulled the furious Vilis away forcefully.

After leaving the tent, the anger on Vilis' face disappeared. She said anxiously, "Your Majesty, we can't leave that fellow inside alone. Carter must be up to no good."

Lanisi looked at her in surprise and said, "Vilis, so you're worried about Night."

Vilis snorted. "I'm worried about this operation. Without that fellow's schemes, we definitely won't be able to complete the mission."

Fei'er, who was beside him, laughed softly. "Tsk tsk, this is the first time Lady Vilis has praised Lord Night so clearly. If Lord Night knows, he will definitely be very pleased."

"Tsk\!"

Vilis turned her head and stopped talking, but she looked into the tent.

Ha'er chased them away and said, "Let's go to your own tents. There's delicious food there. After eating and drinking your fill, rest there and recover your strength. The general might still want to see your performance."

"Performance?"

Lanisi was stunned.

Ha'er grinned and said, "General likes to watch people dance, be it men or women. You're elves and have such a good figure. You should look good dancing, right?"

Vilis held the sword hilt and said coldly, "I only know how to kill."

Ha'er smiled ferociously. "Me too."

After they left, the luxuriously decorated tent was replaced with a brand new carpet.

Carter sat on the bench and tapped the table with her fingers. She looked at the elf youth below with a faint smile.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he was standing below and looking at her with a burning gaze.

"Come up and pour the wine."

Carter suddenly looked at him and said in a commanding tone.

She enjoyed this tone, this status, and arrogance.

Chu Xiaoye walked up, picked up the wine pot, and poured half a glass of red wine. Then, he picked it up and placed it in his mouth, drinking it all.

"It's disgusting."

He smacked his lips and frowned, placing the wine glass on the table.

Carter narrowed his eyes at him and said, "Kid, are you courting death?"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked to her side and sat down on her special recliner. He leaned close to her face and said, "Don't you have to pay your respects to the king?"

"Impudent\!"

Carter swung her fist and attacked.

Chu Xiaoye grabbed her pink fist and blew at her red lips. "In the past, when I rode below to look at the moon, you called me my good brother. Now that you've become an orc, you call you my kid. You're a lion. Even if you become an orc, you're still a lion and you're my lioness. How can you do this?"

Carter gritted her teeth and sneered. "I was the one who pressed you down and took your first time. You have to understand\!"

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and let go of her fist. "It doesn't matter. However, Alisa, no matter what, we've always been intimate. You can't be so heartless, right?"

"Bang\!"

Carter still swung her fist and hit him heavily on the nose.

Chu Xiaoye's nose bled.

At the same time, the anger in his heart immediately surged.

It would be fine if this girl was really an orc, but she was not. She was once his subordinate, a lioness who submitted to him and begged for mercy\!

No matter what she became now, he was a lion that could not be offended in front of her\!

"B\*tch\! You're crazy\!"

Chu Xiaoye was furious and slapped her. With a bang, he slapped her beautiful face heavily and sent her sprawling on the chair.

Carter covered his burning face, his hair disheveled, and stared at him. "You… you…"

"General\!"

Ha'er, who had sent Lanisi away, happened to return. When he saw this scene, he was shocked and furious. He immediately raised the long saber in his hand and rushed up to cut this daring little elf into meat paste\!

Unexpectedly, the young general, who had blood flowing from the corner of his mouth from the slap, suddenly cursed angrily, "Scram\! No one is allowed to enter without my orders\!"

Ha'er, who was holding a big knife, immediately froze in place. She was stunned for a moment before she immediately turned around and left the tent.

"You bastard\! I'll bite you to death\!"

Carter suddenly pounced forward, opened his mouth, and bit Chu Xiaoye's nose fiercely. Her two hands were scratching his chest, and her two slender legs were bouncing around. She was like an angry lioness cub.

"B\*tch\! Do you think I don't know how to bite\! I'm a lion\! I'll bite you to death\!"

Hence, the two of them started to tangle and pound each other. They bit each other.

However, soon, the cursing gradually stopped and heavy breathing started.

Of course, they were still biting and fighting endlessly.

In another tent, Lanisi and the others were waiting anxiously.

Vilis wanted to rush out a few times, but she was stopped by the guards at the door.

The huge sword loli called out to Carter at the door, wanting to fight her, but no one responded to her.

At this moment, Carter was fighting another fellow. Furthermore, she had used all sorts of skills and used all her strength to swear to occupy the active and domineering position.

The sun soon set.

When night fell, a bright bonfire was lit in the Kast military camp.

The soldiers surrounded the bonfire, roasted food, sang, danced, and chatted, drinking wine and blowing on the cows.

The elf girls imprisoned in the tent were all frowning and worried about their Lord Night.

At this moment, their Lord Night was sitting on a soft bench with the young female general. He was hugging her waist and hugging her shoulders. They ate and chatted.

There were still two traces of red on the young female general's delicate face that had yet to retreat.

"A lion really can't do it. It's better now, right?"

The girl looked at our Lord Night, her watery eyes filled with sweetness and gentleness.

"This…"

Chu Xiaoye found it difficult to answer. He ate a piece of barbecued meat and said shamelessly, "A lion naturally has its advantages. Although it can't do in certain aspects, it can open a harem openly, right?"

The girl, who was still gentle a second ago, immediately changed her expression the next second. She grabbed his meat and narrowed her eyes. "Do you believe that I'll let Ha'er bring those little elves out and let the orcs outside enjoy them?"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "I do, of course I do. Alisa, tell me, how did you come here?"

He could only change the topic.

"Hmph\!"

The young female general snorted and let go of her. She continued to lie in his arms softly, hugging his neck and looking at him resentfully. "It's all because of you. That night, I saw that you were going to elope with Catherine and the little girl, so I secretly followed behind you."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but explain, "It's not eloping. The world is so big that I want to go out for a walk."

Carter ignored him and continued, "I saw you kill a few strange things and a big bird. Then, you passed through a layer of something that looked like a wave and suddenly disappeared. I hurriedly followed you. However, no matter how I tried, I could not pass. I was really shocked at that time."

Chu Xiaoye thought of what happened that day and said, "That was a barrier. It was said that only those who opened it from the inside could enter from the outside. However, it's completely closed now. Then, how did you enter at that time?"

Carter said, "I tried for a long time outside but could not enter. I was about to give up, but I suddenly saw a strange thing walk out from inside. It was the orcs we see now. I suddenly thought that when you went in previously, you only went in after killing a few such strange things. Could I kill this strange thing and give it a try? Hence, I suddenly attacked and killed the orc. Then, I came in."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. "That simple?"

Carter nodded, extended his neck, and kissed him on the lips. She smiled and said, "It's that simple. Brother Night, am I smart?"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly remembered what Annie had said before they passed through the barrier that day. At that time, Catherine should not be able to enter. Annie said that there were only two spots, but after they killed the orcs, Catherine could suddenly enter.

It seemed that the situation back then was that as long as one of them went out and was killed, the person outside could enter. However, the prerequisite was that it had to be killed by that person personally.

Back then, he, Catherine, and Annie had killed more than one orc, but Alisha, who was following behind, could not enter. This should be the reason.

"Then why did you come here and become like this after coming in?"

Chu Xiaoye asked again.

Carter narrowed her eyes and recalled. "When I came in, it was a forest full of snow. I did not know where you went. There were no traces or smells on the way. I walked everywhere, then walked out and wandered around. In the end, I wandered here."

"That day, this General Carter brought people to the forest to hunt. I was hungry and was ambushing prey, but they surrounded me. Then, I was captured and brought back to the city at the border."

"Carter seemed to be very curious about me and always told me that she seemed to have seen me somewhere and seemed to have a grudge against me. I could understand what she said. Furthermore, when I saw her for the first time, I felt that I knew her and wanted to kill her. She should be thinking the same thing. She just had some questions for the time being, so she was not in a hurry to attack."

"Hence, that night, I attacked first and bit her neck cruelly. At the last moment, I could tell that she was very terrified and regretful. She should be regretting that she did not kill me directly."

"When I bit her to death and was about to sneak away, a magical thing suddenly happened. I entered her body at once and fainted. When I woke up, I was like this."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in a daze, and the scene of him seeing the young elf back then appeared in his mind.

"Night, do you think it's magical? I'm a lion and actually became an orc. Furthermore, this seems to be a different world from our grassland."

Carter looked up at him in confusion, but her eyes were filled with excitement.

She smiled and said, "But it's okay. I found something more interesting here. I'm now a general of the Kingdom of Kast and a princess of the royal family. I can obtain everything I wanted in the past and fulfill the great dream I once wanted to achieve\!"

"I once wanted to conquer the grassland and become the greatest queen on the grassland\! And now, I want to conquer this place, conquer the entire orc kingdom, and become the greatest queen of all the orc countries\! Then, I will attack humans and kill all the despicable humans\!"

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled as he looked at her and said, "Alisa, did humans hurt you before?"

Carter looked at him and said, "Of course, I almost died in the hands of humans on the grassland. Furthermore, I've seen too many cruel actions of humans on the grassland. If not for them, I think we would have lived more freely and faster. Night, I know that you were almost killed by humans too. And your brother, isn't that so?"

She stuck out her chest and leaned in front of his face. Her red lips were almost touching his lips as she stared into his eyes and said, "Night, work with me\! If we work together, we can definitely become the greatest and strongest kings in this land\! At that time, I will be the queen and you will be the queen's king\! During the day, I will be high up and look down at the countless subjects kneeling at my feet. No one will dare to look up and look at me. In the night, you will be above me and look down at me. I will kneel at your feet and my noble head underground will serve you obediently. Thinking about this scene, aren't you very excited and impatient?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the flickering light in her eyes, like the gaze of a young wandering lion that had once been hungry on the grassland when looking at his territory and the lionesses.

"Night, how is it? Are you tempted? If you agree, you will still be my lion and my king. Furthermore, other than me, you can still have many in your harem."

Carter's eyes were burning and her brows were in high spirits. "You know that I don't care about this place. I only care about my rights and status, the feeling of being looked up to. I liked that feeling since I was young. I liked it so much."

Chu Xiaoye stared at her shining eyes and said sincerely, "Alisa, authority is indeed fascinating, but it will also make people infatuated. Once you fall into it, you will be doomed. You have to think it through."

Carter smiled and said, "You don't have to think. From the moment I was born, I knew that I lived for rights. In this life, I will fight for rights and die in battle\!"

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a moment before hugging her and saying, "You're an orc. It's only right for you to end the war between the orc countries. Not only for yourself, but also for every orc. However, Alisha, you shouldn't have designs on humans. Be it you being a lion or the current orc general, I can tell you with certainty that you have never really understood humans. Humans are not as simple as you think, nor are they as easy to defeat as you imagine. You might burn all the honor you had painstakingly obtained for your recklessness and persistence."

Carter looked at him suspiciously and said, "Night, do you know humans very well?"

Chu Xiaoye laughed at himself and said, "No one knows humans very well. Even humans themselves can't understand themselves. Perhaps a certain human was a human one second ago, and in the next second, he became a god. In the next second, he suddenly became a demon. Even they did not expect the changes in humans and could not think of it. Therefore, Alisa, are you sure that you can defeat such a species that is changing at any time with your method?"

Carter hugged his neck, lowered her long eyelashes, and kissed him on the lips with her red lips. After a long time, she let go and said, "Night, don't I still have you? I know that you're smarter than me. You definitely have a way to deal with humans, right?"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and rejected her heartlessly. "Sorry, Alisa, I won't help you. Your dream is the opposite of mine, do you understand?"

Carter frowned and said, "I don't understand. I remember that your dream was the same as mine. You fought on the grassland, killed everywhere, and became the true king of the grassland, right?"

Chu Xiaoye sighed and said, "That was indeed the case back then. However, at that time, I was only a lion, and I could only see the grassland and the lion in the sky. Now, I see more sky, more grassland, and more species. I see battles that are even more bloody and terrifying than those on our grassland. Therefore, my previous dream is no longer there."

Carter looked at him with a complicated gaze. "Then what is your dream now?"

Chu Xiaoye revealed a smile and seemed to see the scene in his eyes. He said, "I hope to find a place without war or blood, blue sky, green land, and fragrant flowers to spend my life quietly with my pride and my friends."

Carter stared at him and slowly let go of his neck. She shook his head and said, "No, Night, you're not the Night I know. You've changed."

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "Yes, I've changed. Alisa, we're destined to not be together."

"Is that so?"

Carter suddenly hugged him again and even stuck her little hand into his clothes. Her smile returned to her face and her eyes were filled with happiness. "King, my dear king, the king I want is like you. I'm a high and mighty queen, and you can only be above me and not above them. I've said that I like power and have liked it since I was young. Therefore, no matter who it is, don't think of touching it, including you. Now, I'm very happy to hear you say such things without ambition, my dear. Do you know that?"

The girl suddenly exerted strength and pressed him down again. She said with a naughty smile, "We will always be together, my dear Brother Night, Lord Night…"

As he spoke, he stabilized her lips.

When the bonfire program outside was about to end and the orcs ate and drank their fill, preparing to return to the tent to rest, the few elven girls were about to lose control.

Their Lord Night, who they were worried about, was probably already tortured badly by that ruthless young female general.

They pulled out the swords at their waists and rushed out of the tent.

Vilis shouted at the general's tent in the distance, "Carter\! A loser\! Come out and fight me if you have the ability\!"

When she shouted for the third time, the female general suddenly opened the curtain and walked out.

She stood at the door and combed the messy hair in front of her chest with her long fingers as she smiled. "Lady Vilis, why are you so anxious? Are you worried that your beloved little boy will be eaten by me?"

Vilis said angrily, "Carter\! Let him go\! Let's fight\!"

The female general finished combing her hair and tidied her clothes. Then, she said to her softly, "No\!"

Lanisi said, "General Carter, our elves do not have any hatred for your Kingdom of Kast. We crossed the line rashly this time and were just passing by. I only hope that you can let our people go. We will immediately and never stop."

Carter stared at her and sized her up. She said with a smile, "Your Majesty, do you know how to dance?"

Lanisi was stunned and did not answer.

She had only trained in sword-fighting since she was young and had never learned dance. That was not what she liked.

Carter looked at Vilis, Denise, and Fei'er beside her. "Then, do they know how to dance?"

Lanisi frowned and said, "General, none of us know how to do it."

Carter smiled and said, "It's okay if he doesn't know. With your figures, just twisting a few times will make people drool. Didn't you want to save your little boy? Come, come in, dance for me. If I'm happy, I'll let him go."

Chu Xiaoye whispered from the curtain behind her, "Alisa, don't go overboard. They're my friends. Let them twist a few times and dance."
