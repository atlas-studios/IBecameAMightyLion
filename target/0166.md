Chapter 166: Battle of the Kings\!

"Roar—"

The lion's roar immediately sounded\!

The battle started\!

The two lions behind the black-maned lion bared their fangs and pounced ferociously.

Without waiting for Chu Xiaoye's orders, the Chino brothers had already roared and charged forward\!

The four lions immediately fought intensely\!

Chu Xiaoye stood in place without moving.

The black-haired lion also stood there and looked at him with a burning gaze, as if it was still sizing him up.

The three female lions were already impatient and roared at Chu Xiaoye repeatedly.

However, they did not dare to go forward.

The scene last night made them extremely afraid of this young lion.

The Chino brothers were soon no match for their opponents.

However, they still fought bravely and did not retreat.

They erupted with all their courage and strength. They ignored defense and only attacked ferociously\!

Even if they were pushed to the ground, they still bit with all their might\!

One side was fighting to expel, and the other was fighting to survive\!

The Chino brothers knew that once they were defeated today, they would have no place to survive\!

Therefore, they fought with their lives\!

Soon, the other party's two lions were frightened by the two brothers' desperate stance and wounds of all sizes appeared on their bodies.

They started to retreat.

The Chino brothers were covered in wounds as they roared and chased after them.

The black-haired lion finally could not help it.

"Whoosh\!"

He pounced at the young lion in front of him. He did not roar or make any unnecessary movements, as if he was pouncing on a prey and locking its throat\!

Its huge body crushed down like a small mountain\!

He was very fast\!

Chu Xiaoye's gaze froze. He did not fight but quickly dodged to the side.

The black-haired lion missed.

However, he did not stop at all. He immediately turned around and pounced forward again.

Chu Xiaoye retreated again to dodge.

"Roar—"

The black-haired lion finally let out an angry roar and pounced for the third time\!

Chu Xiaoye still dodged.

His speed was very fast. Every time, he would dodge narrowly just as the black-haired lion was about to pounce on him.

The black-haired lion accumulated strength three times in a row, preparing to defeat the enemy in one move, but it missed.

In one go.

Failure after failure\!

Although he was still strong, his temper was aroused.

Usually, when invaders saw the lion of their territory, they would fight bravely, either retreating in defeat or becoming the king in victory. They were very decisive.

However, this kid dodged again and again, making him furious\!

"Roar—"

The black-haired lion roared angrily again and pounced ferociously\!

He wanted to tear this kid into pieces\!

Chu Xiaoye stood in place, bared his fangs, and tensed up all his muscles. He prepared to fight\!

However, when the black-haired lion pounced over with all its might, he jumped to the side with a whoosh like a brown whirlwind\!

The black-haired lion missed for the fourth time.

The anger in his chest rose with a bang and he let out a furious roar that made all the animals tremble in fear. He chased after her again.

Chu Xiaoye still dodged when he was about to pounce on him.

When the black-haired lion paused for a moment, he quickly rushed behind him and immediately bared his fangs, preparing to pounce from behind.

At this moment, the black-haired lion had no choice but to turn around and continue to attack angrily.

The eyes of the three female lions beside him were filled with disdain and pride when they saw this scene.

They seemed to be thinking that this bumpkin from god knows where was indeed a coward. The moment he saw their lion, he peed his pants in fear and only knew how to escape and hide.

At the edge of the bushes not far away, the animals that were watching the commotion seemed to think so too.

The tree that Belia was standing on suddenly swayed. Her father climbed up and stood with her, looking at the battle of the lion.

Belia's eyes were filled with ridicule.

As for the male leopard, it became more and more solemn as it stared intently at the young figure.

He seemed to have seen this battle technique somewhere before.

Chu Xiaoye continued to attack and provoke the other party. Every time the other party attacked with all his might, he would dodge. The strength between the two of them decreased and increased. Gradually, the other party started to lose his mind and his strength was insufficient. Their movements also slowed down.

This was the best time to attack\!

Wasn't this how many small animals caught powerful prey?

The male leopard looked at the familiar figure and suddenly remembered that when he fought the python by the river that night, it was this cub who took the opportunity to eat all his prey\!

However, because of the cub's disturbance, the python let go of him in a hurry, giving him a chance to counterattack and turn the tables.

Therefore, he did not blame this kid.

However, seeing that the fellow who invaded this pride's territory was actually this cub, it really shocked him quite a bit.

He looked at it with a burning gaze, and the more he looked, the more shocked he was.

It was too fast\!

That kid was ridiculously fast\!

No wonder that battle-hardened lion was running around in circles after being shaken by him. It was so tired that it was panting, but it could not touch a single strand of his fur.

This kid's intelligence and combat skills were definitely not something that an adult lion could compare to\!

If nothing unexpected happened, that kid was about to counterattack\!

However, he still could not understand. Even if this kid used this technique to tire out the other party, what could he do?

The size and strength of both sides were not just a little different.

Be it its size, weight, or strength, that adult lion was definitely not something that the cub could compare to.

As long as the cub dared to pounce on him, the other party would only use one bite or even one claw to make him fall to the ground and not get up.

The male leopard narrowed his eyes and stared intently at the figure, his heart filled with confusion.

Perhaps, this kid only wanted to waste the other party's strength and then escape calmly with his team.

However, just as he was thinking this, a scene that stunned him suddenly happened\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

When the huge and extremely strong black-haired lion started to slow down, it was suddenly slapped in the mouth by the cub. Its head tilted and it fell to the ground\!

His mouth was full of blood and the two fangs in his mouth splashed out with the blood\!

His sudden fall was not only unexpected by the male leopard, but also by the other animals who were watching the fun.

The three female lions standing at the side were shocked. They widened their eyes in disbelief.

His initial might as he chased after the other party roaring and running made the other party dodge left and right in a sorry state. They fled in panic and did not dare to fight at all, making the three female lions proud and pleased\!

However, they never would have thought that this would be the end\!

The expert in their hearts had his fangs slapped away by this little lion and he fell to the ground\!

On the tree, the male leopard looked on with a burning gaze.

His daughter, Belia, widened her eyes in disbelief.

She was still mocking him in her heart just now.

When Chu Xiaoye slapped the black-haired lion to the ground, he did not stop at all. With a whoosh, he pounced forward and bit the other party's throat\!

However, he bit his thick mane\!

Before his sharp teeth could pierce through this mane and the skin below, the black-haired lion suddenly roared and turned to bite him fiercely\!

Its sharp fangs and ferocious face looked exceptionally terrifying\!

Chu Xiaoye quickly jumped up and swung his right palm. With a bang, he slapped his open mouth again mercilessly\!

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

The black mane's jaw was broken\!
