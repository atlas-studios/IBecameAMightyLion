Chapter 193: The Lion King's Despair

Eh, it was a little familiar.

When he got close, Chu Xiaoye realized that he had seen this white lion before.

That day on the other side of the river, he was the one who instructed the crocodiles to stop the pythons in the sea.

Logically speaking, with his status and strength, it was impossible for the other party to take a fancy to his small territory, let alone invade in this way like those wandering lions.

He stood there majestically. His majestic and strong body, his dignified aura, and his snow-white fur all highlighted his powerful identity.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and walked over quickly.

Catherine's muscles were tense. For the first time, she felt like she was facing a great enemy.

Seeing them walk over, the white lion Kakib's gaze was like two amber gems that flickered with a charming luster.

This was an extremely charming white lion.

Chu Xiaoye felt that his handsomeness might be a little threatened.

He was very disgusted with lions that liked to play cool at every turn.

Therefore, when he came in front of this white lion, his gaze was very unfriendly.

Kakib stared at the two young lions, one female and one male. Suddenly, with a whoosh, he pounced at them without warning\!

Catherine's gaze turned cold. She rushed out from behind Chu Xiaoye and jumped up. With a whoosh, her sharp claws grabbed at the white lion\!

At the same time, Chu Xiaoye rushed up from the ground.

A glint flashed in Kakib's eyes. He tilted his head and easily avoided Catherine's claws. At the same time, he raised his heavy claws gently and blocked Chu Xiaoye's claws with a bang.

Then, both sides passed each other.

This short exchange seemed simple, but it was actually a collision of speed, strength, agility, and reaction speed.

Towards Catherine's merciless killing move and Chu Xiaoye's swift and peerless slap, this white lion displayed extremely strong strength.

Both sides turned around and looked at each other.

Catherine's gaze was cold. Just as she was about to pounce on him again, Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and stopped her.

Obviously, this white lion was not here to find trouble today.

As for invading the territory, that was even more impossible.

The other party did not use any killer move or all his strength.

He did not use his claws, and the other party clearly did not use his claws either.

Chu Xiaoye looked suspiciously at the tall white lion in front of him, waiting for his explanation.

Kakib raised his head and looked at the river behind him, then at the downstream that extended to the distant sea.

Then, he extended his claws.

The meaning was obvious.

"Kid, since you have this territory and become the owner of this territory, you have to protect it. At the same time, you should contribute to this beautiful grassland and all the creatures on it."

Kakib's gaze clearly expressed his intentions.

Chu Xiaoye thought of the python that day.

That day, if not for this white lion and the crocodiles that were trying their best to stop them, the pythons from the sea would have already swum ashore and flooded the grassland.

The first to bear the brunt was his territory.

Therefore, logically, he should indeed do something.

Since he was a member of this grassland, this territory had become his home, and in the future, it would also become the home of every member of the cold father's pride, he naturally could not sit idle.

"Of course."

His gaze expressed his intentions.

If there was a need, he was willing to do so.

If not for the python disaster last time and the alliance of the grassland animals last time, he might have felt abrupt and puzzled about today's matter. However, he could now accept it calmly.

The entire grassland or the entire world was undergoing changes.

All creatures, be it animals or plants, were evolving and mutating.

The creatures of the sea were naturally no exception.

This grass looked like a fertile land, a beautiful environment, and lush vegetation. It was a paradise for animals. However, it was on the verge of the sea, and danger naturally followed.

The sea was the most mysterious place in the world and the largest place. It could hold countless creatures.

In the depths of the sea, there were still many secrets and creatures that even humans could not probe.

Therefore, when the tide of mutations arrived, the sea naturally became the most dangerous and mysterious place.

This beautiful grassland bordered the sea. Then, there would naturally be all sorts of unexpected creatures invading, and they would even want to eat this place and kill the creatures here.

Therefore, the animals on the entire grassland had to work together to resist the enemy.

Of course, when there were no enemies, the rules of nature, the survival of the fittest, would still exist here and continue.

Today, this white lion had already expressed its intentions very clearly.

Chu Xiaoye was a foreign lion and might not know much about these things. Furthermore, he had just occupied the land to become a king. The last time he dealt with those sea pythons, he had displayed sufficient strength.

Therefore, Kakib came and prepared to invite him to join the team that fought against the sea creatures together.

Chu Xiaoye had no reason to refuse.

This was his responsibility.

"Roar—"

Kakib suddenly raised his head and let out a long roar at the sky.

Then, a snow-white goshawk flew out of the cloud and quickly landed, circling above him.

"This is our messenger. When we need your help, it will naturally contact you."

After Kakib expressed his intentions, he raised his claws and waved them at Chu Xiaoye and Catherine. Then, he turned around and jumped gently to the other side of the river, leaving quickly.

This was a lion with intelligence and strength.

Chu Xiaoye looked at his gaze just now and his waving claws before he left. He felt like he was facing a human.

With such intelligence, it was no wonder he could become the strongest existence on this grassland.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the river downstream and the ocean that he could not see gradually turned grave.

Catherine stood behind him but looked at his figure. Her gaze was as focused as ever and she seemed to be unable to care about anything else.

Even if the world was ending, she did not care.

As long as she could stay by his side.

In the evening.

The furious roar of the blue-eyed lion king suddenly came from the neighboring territory.

Chu Xiaoye thought that another wandering lion had taken the opportunity to invade.

When he arrived with Catherine, the Chino brothers and the two female lions had already been standing at the border for a long time.

This time, it was not a wandering lion that invaded.

The once majestic and powerful blue-eyed lion king was limping and squatting on the ground, being attacked by his female lions and subordinates.

The three lions that had previously been extremely respectful to him were currently treating him, the former king, in the most ferocious and heartless manner.

As for the female lions that had previously been loving and respectful to him, they roared at the side to support him.

The blue-eyed lion king bared its fangs and squatted on the ground. From his roar, one could feel that he was so angry and desperate.

Although this matter seemed cruel and heartless, it was actually something that often happened in a normal pride.

If the lion kings in the pride were old and weak, or if they were seriously injured and could no longer resist the wandering lions or protect them, under normal circumstances, they would be jointly chased out by the female lions in the pride.

Because he was already useless in the pride and would only waste more food.

At this moment, the blue-eyed lion king's hind legs were injured and its entire body was covered in wounds. Even if it was lucky to survive, it could not recover its former combat strength.

Therefore, they started to dislike him.

However, this once-powerful king seemed to be unwilling to accept reality.

He was unwilling to leave this familiar home and the territory he had protected for so many years.

Or he wanted to die here.

The three foreign lions that were growing quickly in the mutation wave roared as they attacked from different directions, attacking and biting mercilessly\!

The blue-eyed lion king could only open its mouth and counterattack helplessly.

In the blink of an eye, more wounds appeared on the lion who was already riddled with wounds.

Seeing that he was already an arrow at the end of its flight, the fear in the female lions' hearts towards him had long disappeared. They all went forward to bite him.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the border and looked deeply at the bloody and cruel scene in front of him. He could not help but sigh.

Although this was a common thing in the animal world, the might of this blue-eyed lion king and the reverence and respect these female lions and lions had for him were still vivid in his mind.

This lion king, who had once terrified his enemies and opponents, was actually going to die under the fangs of his lionesses and subordinates today. It was really sad.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Catherine, who was behind him, then at the Chino brothers and the two female lions. He thought to himself, "Will this be the outcome for me in the future?"

Catherine raised her claws and looked coldly at the Chino brothers and the two female lions.

Her meaning was clear. She would dig out the intestines of whoever dared to betray Chu Xiaoye\!

Chu Xiaoye retracted his gaze and could not bear to see the miserable outcome of his former opponent. He turned around and prepared to leave.

"Roar—"

At this moment, the blue-eyed lion king suddenly roared angrily and bit the mouth of a lion. Then, it struggled to stand up and retreated towards the border.

Once he stood up, his tall body, lush burgundy mane, and ferocious face full of scars immediately gave the female lions and lions a great impact.

They immediately froze in place, feeling terrified.

The lion king's aura was still there\!

The blue-eyed lion king bit the lion's mouth and retreated step by step. When he retreated to the border, he suddenly loosened his teeth and crossed the border, retreating to Chu Xiaoye's territory.

The lion that he let go of had its mouth full of blood and was exceptionally furious. It suddenly roared angrily and pounced at him\!

"Whoosh\!"

However, just as he crossed the border and before he could land on the ground, Catherine had already rushed up and suddenly pierced his abdomen with her claws. With a whoosh, she cut his stomach open\!
