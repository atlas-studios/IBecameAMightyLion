Chapter 105: The Lion King's Fear

The night was hot.

However, Chu Xiaoye's heart was a little cold.

If he was not wrong, that imposing figure should be a tiger.

However, how could a tiger that had always lived in the jungle come to this grassland with sparse trees?

Even if the environment was ruined and the tigers had no choice but to migrate, they would never migrate so far away.

The only possibility was that humans had deliberately brought them here.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of the broken-horned rhinoceros he had seen when he went to the river to drink water.

The broken horn of the rhinoceros was very flat. It did not seem to have been broken during a fight, and it could not have been done by a poacher.

If it was done by a poacher, the rhinoceros would have died long ago. Furthermore, the rhinoceros horn would be cruelly uprooted from the flesh.

Then, there was only one possibility.

To protect this rhinoceros and not be killed by poachers, a human deliberately gave the rhinoceros anesthetic and saw off its horn.

Only forest guards would do so.

In other words, this grassland was already under the surveillance of humans\!

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye felt even more uneasy.

If those forest guards discovered his abnormality, they would probably immediately catch him and cut him up for research\!

However, his two golden claws were already broken.

As for the Maasai, they were nothing to worry about.

Even if they picked up the two golden claws, they would only bring them back to store as ornaments.

They would not think so much.

Furthermore, there were so many lions on the grassland, so how could they know which lion's claws it was?

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye was only worried about those forest guards and the so-called animal experts who were like peeping Toms.

If the tiger he saw just now was really deliberately let in by humans, he would have to be careful of humans following and peeping at him at any time.

He had to restrain himself recently.

Of course, without his claws, he had no choice but to restrain himself.

He only hoped that the tiger would not provoke their pride. Otherwise, even if he risked being discovered, he would let it know who was the true king of this grassland\!

When they returned to the camp, the night was already deep.

When the female lions saw that the two brothers were injured, they immediately stood up from the bushes and walked over.

Aisha ran over anxiously and licked the wounds on Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail's legs, her eyes filled with worry.

Xi'er also walked to Chu Xiaoye's side and licked his wounds like a mother.

Catherine carefully placed Chu Xiaoye in the grass and looked at him deeply before leaving reluctantly.

His mother and family were here, and she was unnecessary.

The pride had not eaten for a few days.

Therefore, they had to go out to hunt tonight.

After the cold father returned, the four female lions immediately set off and crawled into the bushes at the back.

Tonight, not only were they going to search the entire bushes, but they were also going to the distant grassland.

At this moment, hungry carnivores were everywhere.

If there was no adult male lion following them, even if the four female lions caught prey, they might not be able to enjoy it, let alone bring it back.

Hence, after a short rest, the cold father followed their scent and caught up.

Before leaving, he turned around and looked at the cruel lioness cub that always liked to dig out its internal organs.

With this lioness cub here, the camp should be very safe.

Therefore, he left with ease.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the grass and watched his retreating figure, secretly worried.

If he encountered the king of the jungle, could his father defeat him?

Tigers were good at ambushing. There should be few enemies in the dense bushes.

After the cold father left, the camp quietened down.

Little Curly Tail lay in the grass and was already asleep from exhaustion.

His experience today would definitely be unforgettable.

That seemingly harmless upright animal was actually more terrifying than any beast in this grassland.

He, the future king of the grassland, had also learned a very important lesson today.

Humans were not to be trifled with\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly looked up at the Baobab tree.

He had originally decided to go and bring water to Maya tonight.

Now that he had no claws, could not climb trees, and had not told Mei Mei where he hid the water, what should he do?

Just as he was looking up and worrying about the Baobab tree, Catherine, who had been secretly looking at him, immediately stood up from the grass and walked under the tree.

She looked back at him, waiting for his orders.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. He suddenly felt that this lioness cub was a little too smart.

At this moment, he realized that the lioness cub's eyes had turned black and shining\!

Those black eyes were as deep and distant as the night sky in summer, filled with mystery and beauty.

Demons\!

Was the world really going to be in chaos?

Chu Xiaoye was in a daze, feeling bewildered and uneasy.

Seeing that he was staring at her, Catherine immediately lowered her head like a shy little girl.

Chu Xiaoye shook his head vigorously to get rid of the messy thoughts in his mind. He raised his claws and pointed at the tree.

However, he was immediately vexed.

Just like Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, the little lioness only knew about the food in the storage room and did not know where the water source was. What should he do?

Catherine nimbly climbed up the tree and went straight to the storage room. She picked out a piece of warthog and lowered her head to look at him.

Chu Xiaoye sighed inwardly and shook his head, signaling her to come down.

Catherine's eyes flickered. She stared at him for a while before putting down the warthog in her mouth.

She suddenly took out the water bag with water from the storage room.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes lit up, but then they dimmed.

Although the little lioness understood what he meant, she did not know where the water source was hidden. What was the use?

Catherine bit the water bag and turned around to climb down.

When she climbed to the thickest first branch, she stopped and started to stroke the fur of the prey on it with her claws.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stood up when he saw this scene.

After Catherine pushed aside the thick layers of fur, she did not stop at all and immediately used her claws to dig at the damp wood dregs that were pressed very tightly.

Soon.

A pool of water was revealed under the moonlight\!

She lowered her head and looked at him, seemingly embarrassed. She immediately threw the water bag in her mouth into the hole filled with water and started to fill it.

Chu Xiaoye froze in place and looked at her in a daze.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the roar of a lion suddenly came from the bushes behind\!

It was Seno's roar\!

His roar was filled with anger and fear\!

The grass rustled\!

"Whoosh\!"

Seno suddenly rushed out of the bushes and came to the camp of the cold father's pride.

There were a few deep bloody wounds on his back, and he looked like he was running for his life in a panic.

The mighty lion king, who was in his prime, was forced into such a sorry state\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately woke up from their sleep.

"Whoosh—"

Catherine, who was on the tree, could not be bothered to store water anymore. She hurriedly jumped down from the high branch and ran in front of Chu Xiaoye, protecting him. She bared her sharp fangs at Seno, who had trespassed her territory\!

She arched her body and prepared to pounce on him\!

Seno did not look at her. Instead, he hurriedly turned around and faced the forest. He bared his fangs and let out a trembling roar.

It was as if there was something terrifying hiding inside\!
