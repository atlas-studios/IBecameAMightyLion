Chapter 316: Battle of Life and Death Part 2

Night.

The cool wind blew on the grassland.

The lush grass seemed to have grown a lot overnight.

The sparse and short trees also grew lush, thick, and tall unconsciously.

The escape of the herbivores gave the plants on the grassland the best opportunity. They seemed to be growing crazily every day.

The gathered pride quickly exhausted the herbivores here.

However, the number of herbivores did not decrease. Instead, they reproduced and grew more quickly far away from the pride, just like the lush grass on the grassland.

In just a few days, a large number of herbivores had gathered on the grassland where Chu Xiaoye's team used to camp.

Where the black lions left, more herbivores returned one after another.

The prides of both sides started to gather.

The empty grassland behind them became a paradise for animals and plants.

On this grassland, other than the pride that was constantly decreasing because of the war, the other animals were growing quickly.

Be it the black lions or Chu Xiaoye's team, they knew that they had to fight a decisive battle as soon as possible. Otherwise, it would be a problem for these hundreds of members to even eat their fill.

Chu Xiaoye brought more than 700 lions and arrived at the center of the grassland majestically.

Wave after wave of black lions fled and gathered.

Under the lead of the black lion king, Balo, more than 500 black lion members quickly gathered together and turned into a super pride army.

The black lions were different from the lions here. Their members were mostly lions.

Therefore, among the 500 plus black lions, there were nearly 300 lions. The remaining were all female lions and young cubs.

As for the old lions, they were not qualified to follow them to this grassland.

Their former grassland had already been occupied by more powerful species, and their elderly lions had generously died on that soil.

The old lions' stubbornness meant that one day, their black lion tribe would return to their homeland, defeat the enemy, and take back their home.

However, Balo knew that in front of those powerful enemies, their black lions could not withstand a single blow and would never have the chance to return.

Therefore, they had to find a new territory and home.

On this new grassland, he suddenly realized that their black lion tribe seemed to be invincible.

These brown lions were no match for them.

Until that day, news came from ahead that wave after wave of black lions died. Then, the hundred-over lion teams he sent out were also completely wiped out.

The enemy was an army formed by wandering lions that had been frightened away by their army.

Balo was furious, but at that time, he still needed to lead the team to pacify other places.

Now, when he eliminated and chased away all the local lions on the grassland, he suddenly realized that the wandering lions that he had chased away at the edge of the grassland were actually gathered together and became exceptionally strong.

The legend of their black lion race being invincible on this grassland was finally broken.

Balo's repeated failures finally woke him up.

In the other party's pride, there was definitely a lion king who was extremely strong and intelligent.

Soon, he obtained news.

The other party's leader was only a young lion who had yet to grow the mane on his neck.

Balo did not look down on him.

He was the beneficiary of the blood rain. He knew clearly that all animals were mutating, and he was not the only lucky animal.

To be able to gather so many lions that had lost their homes and kill their black tribe again and again, it was obvious that the young lion king could not be underestimated.

Therefore, when he learned that the other party had brought the army over, he did not hesitate or be careless at all. He immediately gathered all the teams and rushed over. 

He knew that this decisive battle not only determined whether their black lion tribe could continue to live or not, it also determined the survival of the other party's pride.

Therefore, both sides would definitely fight with their lives\!

After Balo brought the army to eat their fill, they advanced majestically in the night.

When the scouts brought back news that the opposing pride was only two kilometers away, Balo immediately ordered the army to stop and recuperate.

He divided his strongest strength behind him like a sharp blade, preparing to pierce through the other party's pride and give him a thunderous blow\!

The night quickly passed.

However, they still stopped in place.

They liked the night.

At night, the night was their best disguise.

They were killers in the night. Any enemy who dared to challenge them in the night would be completely destroyed before the sun rose\!

The bright sun blinded them.

On the green grassland, there was a black mass as far as the eye could see. The entire land had almost turned black.

The rats and rabbits underground were hiding in the hole, trembling. The crocodiles in the river sank to the bottom of the river and fled in panic. Even the vultures in the sky did not dare to stop.

The killing intent of the black lions almost filled the entire grassland.

They were waiting for night.

At the same time.

Chu Xiaoye also brought the team and stopped two kilometers away from them.

Catherine and Mei Mei brought back accurate news.

Chu Xiaoye found a tall Baobab tree and climbed up to the highest canopy. He looked forward, and his eyes flickered with two golden lights.

Soon, he climbed down from the tree.

Looking at the majestic pride behind him, he knew that although he had many members, their combat strength was not as strong as those black lions.

If the other party gathered their strongest strength and pierced into their team until they reached the front of the female lions and young cubs, then no matter how powerful he was, he could not change the defeat of the entire team.

Panic and fear were contagious.

Furthermore, these prides had long planted the fear of those black lions in their hearts.

Once the other party displayed sufficient strength and ferocity and threatened the safety of their cubs, the entire pride would immediately be in chaos and utterly defeated.

Therefore, he had to attack first and mess up the other party's team.

However, the other party's strongest strength was definitely concentrated at the front. Even with Blue Eyes and the others, he, Little Curly Tail, and the others, it would probably be difficult to charge in.

From the previous mutated black lion leader, he could tell that there were definitely more powerful lions in the other party's pride.

If they really wanted to charge forward rashly, they would probably be completely wiped out.

Therefore, he had to use other methods.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment and climbed up the Baobab tree again. He looked out for a while and suddenly looked at the river below.

Opposite the river was another barren grassland that was almost a desert.

His eyes lit up. He immediately climbed down the tree and chose Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, Tilly, Molly, Blue Eyes, mixed fur, and the other fifty strong lions.

As for the tank One-eyed, the Jerry brothers, the Chino brothers, Lars, and the others, they were in charge of leading these lions here to wait for orders, stabilize the formation, and wait for their signal.

After assigning their respective missions, Chu Xiaoye immediately brought the small team to the river and prepared to cross it. He quietly circled behind and attacked from the front and back.

He believed that the cubs and female lions in the other party's pride were behind.
