Chapter 457: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled and he immediately accelerated\!

Three crystal whiskers lit up. This meant that this ancient ferocious beast was extremely terrifying. Even if the three of them worked together, they might not be its match. Instead of the three of them being in danger, why not he lure this ancient ferocious beast away alone? Perhaps he could still survive.

After all, he had a skill that could save his life—Speed\!

Although this ancient ferocious beast was also very fast, under his sprinting speed, it could only eat farts.

"Roar—"

He turned around and roared at Catherine and Alisa, telling them to scram.

However, he did not need to see to know that the two female lions would not listen to him.

Therefore, he exerted strength again and started to run at his fastest speed that did not count as a jet.

The saber-toothed tiger was huge and faster. Not only was it not far away from him, its four hooves were flying as if it was riding the clouds and soon caught up.

Catherine and Alisa, who were following behind, were gradually left far behind.

At this moment, Alisa finally understood dejectedly. The speed she was so proud of was not worth mentioning in front of that fellow.

However, she and Catherine did not give up. They still ran with all their might and followed behind.

Soon, Chu Xiaoye and the saber-toothed tiger disappeared from their vision and into the dark night.

They could only follow the scent and continue to follow.

"Roar\!"

The roar of the saber-toothed tiger came from afar\!

The saber-toothed tiger caught up to Chu Xiaoye with its extremely fast speed. Just as it was about to pounce on him and kill him in one move, there was an explosion behind Chu Xiaoye and a huge black smoke suddenly sprayed out\!

The strong airflow immediately messed up the saber-toothed tiger's whiskers, but its fierce face was distorted.

What was even more terrifying was the strong stench that made it instantly vomit\!

"Ugh —"

It spat out the prey it had just eaten tonight.

Chu Xiaoye had already used the airflow to open up a distance of more than ten meters from it again.

A strong black smoke covered the entire face of the saber-toothed tiger.

If it were an ordinary animal, they would definitely panic, feel dizzy, and even faint on the spot.

However, this saber-toothed tiger quickly woke up and immediately held its breath. With a whoosh, it instantly rushed out of the extremely smelly black smoke and roared as it continued to chase\!

The furious saber-toothed tiger's eyes flickered with a demonic green light. Its body seemed to be taller and stronger, and its running speed suddenly increased.

The two sharp fangs at the corner of its mouth flickered with a cold light that was like blades under the dim moonlight\!

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that this furious ancient beast had pulled away from him again and looked even more ferocious and terrifying.

"Roar\!"

The saber-toothed tiger suddenly roared angrily, jumped up, and pounced at him.

Chu Xiaoye was still running and did not panic. When the saber-toothed tiger was about to pounce behind him, he raised his tail. With a bang, he sprayed out another strong black smoke. Then, like a rocket, he instantly jumped more than ten meters away\!

"Ugh —"

The unexpected saber-toothed tiger was attacked by this extremely smelly poisonous gas again. As soon as it landed, it vomited.

It never would have thought that this despicable and dirty cub still had farts\!

The saber-toothed tiger was shocked and furious. It jumped up again and chased, letting out a deafening roar.

This time, Chu Xiaoye was already prepared. His ears immediately bent to cover his ears to prevent him from peeing from this roar.

He did not fart again. He looked back and continued to run.

The saber-toothed tiger was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it roared and chased after him.

This time, it did not jump up again. Instead, it chased after Chu Xiaoye and raised its claws, preparing to slap Chu Xiaoye's butt.

Chu Xiaoye immediately raised his tail and farted.

The saber-toothed tiger was long prepared. It immediately stopped in its tracks and held its breath. It turned out that its actions just now were just a test. It had always been vigilant.

However, this time, Chu Xiaoye was pretending and did not really fart. After it stopped in its tracks, he immediately put down his tail and fled.

Seeing that he had been played, the saber-toothed tiger was furious. With a whoosh, it chased after him, as if it had already used all its strength and fastest speed\!

After the test just now, it already knew that this despicable and dirty cub was really exhausted and had no more farts\!

Obviously, how could a small body hide so many farts\!

"Roar\!"

It suddenly jumped up, bared its sharp fangs, and roared as it pounced forward\!

This time, it wanted to use its dagger-like sharp teeth to pierce through this kid's body to vent its anger\!

"Boom —"

A loud bang shook the sky and earth\!

A terrifying black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye's butt like a hurricane with an extremely powerful ejecting force\!

The saber-toothed tiger that had just pounced behind Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to react when it suddenly felt a violent wind attack. It blew directly on its face and covered its entire head, actually causing its huge body to tilt and fall to the ground with a bang.

"Ugh —"

Before it could get up, it opened its mouth and spat out acid that had long lost its food dregs\!

Damn\! It was so smelly\!\!\!

"Roar\!"

"Ugh —"

It let out a roar in anger, but it accidentally sucked in another black smoke and vomited again.

Chu Xiaoye stopped more than ten meters away and turned around to look at it. He was secretly happy. Not only had his body become stronger, the poisonous gas in his body was also stronger than before. Congratulations\!

The saber-toothed tiger roared angrily and jumped up again. Its eyes were round as it suddenly rushed towards him crazily\!

He was really angry\!

However, after vomiting and eating farts a few times, this ancient ferocious beast had probably exhausted a lot of its strength and energy. Its intelligence had probably been seriously damaged. Otherwise, why would it look so crazy?

Chu Xiaoye decided to walk it again. Perhaps he really had a chance to kill it.

Seeing that the ancient ferocious beast was chasing after him in anger, Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and continued to run\!

When the saber-toothed tiger was about to catch up to him, he immediately raised his tail. With a puff, he squeezed out a trace of black smoke from behind, looking like he had already exhausted his smelly farts.

The saber-toothed tiger was secretly happy when it saw this scene, but it still did not dare to attack and prepared to continue observing.

It raised its huge claws and pretended to slap.

"Pfft…"

Chu Xiaoye raised his tail again and squeezed out a trace of black smoke.

The saber-toothed tiger, who had stopped in its tracks, was overjoyed and its courage increased\!

"Roar\!"

He no longer had any scruples and immediately roared. He jumped up, opened his bloody mouth, and pounced ferociously again\!

"Kid\! This time, I'll definitely tear your skin, flesh, bones, and soul apart\!"

"Boom —"

A loud bang shook the sky and earth\!

An even larger black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye's butt like a volcanic eruption. It rolled over and instantly covered its entire body\!

The saber-toothed tiger's huge mouth and round eyes seemed to have suddenly stiffened. Even though it had already fallen to the ground in a sorry state and its entire body was wrapped in black fog, it did not move.
