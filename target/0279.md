Chapter 279: Traitor

Obviously.

An idiot was an idiot. It was useless no matter how much they created an opportunity for him.

When Chu Xiaoye pretended to leave and hid in the grass in the distance, Little Curly Tail immediately stuck out his butt and pooped at Molly to disgust her.

Since he could not bully her, he would continue to disgust her\!

Molly left angrily.

Little Curly Tail was pleased with himself, as if he had won a battle.

Chu Xiaoye sighed. He originally wanted to rush out and teach that stupid kid a lesson, but he thought that it was useless to teach him a lesson. Perhaps he would beat this smelly brother even more stupid. He could only give up.

When he was about to reach the bushes, Tilly ran over and raised her snow-white claws, pointing in the direction of the river to show that she was thirsty and wanted to drink water.

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes at her and ignored her. He walked past her.

In the evening, everyone went to drink water, but she slept in the tree. Now that everyone was busy, she wanted to drink water again. Wasn't this looking for trouble?

"Roar\!"

Seeing that he was about to leave, Tilly immediately caught up to him and blocked his path. She lowered her ears and looked at him with her light blue eyes, looking pitiful.

"Smelly fart king, go with me. I'm so thirsty. Wu…"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not have any protective feelings for the fairer sex and slapped her head to make her dodge.

If you want to drink water, go ahead and drink it yourself. You're so powerful, who would dare to provoke you? If you don't take the initiative to provoke others, others will be very happy already\!

Tilly immediately covered her head, bared her fangs, and glared.

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with her anymore. He walked past her and left.

"This bastard\!"

Tilly looked at his back and gritted her teeth.

The cold father lay in the grass not far away and secretly watched the scene. He muttered in his heart, This unfilial son is as stupid as a pig. No, he's much more stupid than a pig\! In the future, he will be a bachelor\!

You stood on the grassland looking at stupid pigs, but the one looking at stupid pigs was lying in the grass looking at you.

No one knew who was the real stupid pig.

After Chu Xiaoye returned to the bushes, Catherine had already finished eating the rabbit leg he gave her and was resting on the branch where he lay every night.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her and left quietly.

The little lioness had been patrolling under the hot sun during the day and had been busy for the entire day. He would let her rest now.

Anyway, he did not need any shadow now.

His speed had already reached the peak of perfection. No shadow could catch up to him.

After he left, Catherine, who was on the tree, slowly opened her eyes and looked at his retreating figure with a dejected gaze.

"Brother Ye, you really don't need me anymore…"

Chu Xiaoye passed through the bushes and prepared to see the defense of the other borders.

When he reached the territory guarded by the Jerry brothers, he suddenly saw a female lion walk out of the territory. After looking around, she quickly ran into the distant darkness.

Chu Xiaoye was puzzled and immediately followed.

The lioness continued forward and looked back from time to time, looking very vigilant.

Chu Xiaoye was filled with doubts and followed silently.

Because the grassland was lush, every time the lionesses turned around, he would crawl on the ground and lower his head. Therefore, the other party did not sense anything.

The territory in front was not divided by them.

He had already solemnly warned the pride that they could not come out alone at night, let alone leave their territory easily. Where was this female lion going when she was acting suspiciously?

Chu Xiaoye suddenly had an ominous feeling.

Suddenly, the female lion ran towards the bushes in front of her.

The bushes only grew a few bushes and a few sparse trees. On the grassland, they could be seen everywhere.

The female lion had left the territory so carefully and ran there. It was definitely not just to rest or hunt there.

Chu Xiaoye immediately lowered his body and quietly approached under the cover of the grass.

The moonlight tonight was a little dim, but it did not affect his vision.

He could still see very far and clearly.

Just as the female lion ran into the bushes, a tall black shadow walked out of the bushes and rubbed its head and body affectionately with the female lion.

It was a strong black lion\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled when he saw this scene, and a cold light flickered in his eyes.

It turned out that spies and traitors had already appeared in the team\!

The female lion with brown fur lay on the ground humbly and happily. She twisted her body and tail and licked the black lion's fur in a fawning manner.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his body even more and lowered his head to prevent his shining eyes from exposing his tracks. Then, he started to crawl forward silently.

At this moment, he no longer had the time to call for his other companions to help, let alone roar and alert the enemy.

He had to get closer and observe if there were other black lions hiding in the small bushes.

Then, he had to kill this black lion to prevent him from bringing the news back.

The black lion was using his charm to charm the lioness.

The female lion had already forgotten herself. She fawned on him and was as lowly as a slave.

Chu Xiaoye took advantage of their concentration and slowly approached. Soon, he arrived in the grass thirty meters away and looked at the entire forest clearly.

Other than this pair of moving figures, there were no other figures in the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze was cold as he revealed his sharp golden claws.

Suddenly, he realized that there was a crystal whisker beside the black lion's mouth that was emitting a weak light, causing the black face to look even more ferocious.

This black lion was tall and strong, not much different from the Chino brothers.

However, from the shining crystal whisker, it could be seen that he was even much stronger than Blue Eyes and the others. He was probably a very important figure in the black pride.

Did such an expert need to take action personally to play a honey trap?

No wonder this lioness was so infatuated that she was willing to be a traitor and betray her entire tribe.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye no longer hesitated. Taking advantage of the time when they were entangled again, he immediately jumped up from the grass and shot out like an arrow\!

"Roar—"

The black lion was shocked and immediately jumped up from the female lion's body, waiting solemnly. As for the female lion, she cried out in pain and rolled on the ground.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly slapped the black lion's head.

This slap of strength made even a big tree tremble\!

However, he did not slap the black lion's head.

Although his speed was very fast and he almost arrived in an instant, the black lion's reaction speed was not inferior to his. It immediately jumped one after another and dodged.

Chu Xiaoye missed.

The black lion did not hesitate and immediately pounced forward, ferocious and strong.

He knew that he had been discovered, so he had to make sure that this young lion never returned\!

When the female lion saw this scene, she immediately retreated into the distance in fear.

When she saw the golden fur on Chu Xiaoye's neck, her body immediately trembled and she trembled in fear as she fell to the ground.

Of course she knew this young lion king.
