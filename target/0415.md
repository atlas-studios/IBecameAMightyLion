Chapter 415: Untitled

How embarrassing\!

If other members of the pride knew, his lion king image that he had painstakingly built up would completely collapse.

Fortunately, there was only Catherine here.

This female cub had always been obedient and would never speak nonsense.

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to tangle with the cunning female leopard anymore, afraid that he would attract the attention of the other members. After glaring at her fiercely, he turned around and continued to search the nearby forest.

Belia, who had succeeded in her scheme, was still laughing non-stop on the tree, as if she could not stop. Or perhaps she suddenly liked this very special laughter and was enjoying herself.

Catherine looked at her with flickering eyes, turned around, and followed Chu Xiaoye.

She did not think that there was anything to be pleased about. Furthermore, this method did not seem to have any effect on the king's male instincts.

The night was quiet and the forest was deep.

Chu Xiaoye observed the wind and grass around him vigilantly. He did not discover any traces of humans, nor did he see any traces left behind by other humans.

He did not dare to leave the pride too far and could only turn around to return.

That trap made him extremely nervous, so tonight would be another sleepless night.

When he returned to the pride's camp, he saw Belia walking proudly in front of the human girl, showing off her tall and slender figure proudly, as well as her waist and butt that were very flexible.

Furthermore, she opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue, proudly declaring that she had just been blessed by the king.

The little girl looked at her in confusion, as if she did not understand.

However, when she saw this female leopard twisting her butt around vigorously and even circling her, she thought that her butt was itchy and wanted her to help scratch it. Therefore, the little girl could only walk forward and extend her little hand to scratch her butt.

"Roar —"

Belia suddenly jumped up and let out a furious roar\!

This little thing actually dared to take advantage of her\!

Her body belonged to the king\! Only the king could touch her\!

And her butt was only the king…

Right at this moment, Belia saw that Chu Xiaoye had returned. She immediately put away her fangs and claws and ran towards Chu Xiaoye with a wronged expression, indicating that she had been bullied.

"That little rascal actually touched my butt\! She doesn't care about the king at all\!"

As Belia complained about the little girl's bad behavior, she leaned close to Chu Xiaoye and prepared to start rubbing her body against his again.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not stand on ceremony and slapped her to the ground.

I haven't settled the score with you for what happened just now, but you're courting death again\!

Belia lay on the ground and looked up with tears in her eyes, as if she was saying, "You just kissed me and now you're starting to slap me. Doesn't the king's conscience hurt?"

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with her. With a whoosh, he jumped up the tree and climbed to the highest point to observe the surroundings.

He was not in a good mood and was very nervous. If this female leopard dared to pester him again, he did not mind letting her taste the black smoke leopard meat\!

Fortunately, Belia saw that he was in a bad mood and did not pester him again. Instead, she returned to the male and female leopards and continued to boast.

Belita was in a daze at the side, looking confused, as if she had yet to understand the matters between men and women.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a roar suddenly came from the forest not far away, like the sound of a warthog.

His voice was filled with fear and despair\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and hurriedly looked under the tree. Pit immediately crawled out of the hole. The other two warthogs hurriedly crawled out of the bushes.

It was not them.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the place where the scream came from was the forest with traps previously.

He had already removed the cover on the surface of the trap. He did not expect that prey would still fall.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and instructed everyone to wait for orders. He ran over with Catherine and prepared to check the situation.

The warthog's roar was exceptionally loud.

If this trap was dug by humans, then this loud roar might attract humans.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and quickly ran close. He observed from afar and saw that there was nothing unusual around him. Then, he walked in front of the trap and looked down.

What fell from the pit was not a warthog, but a fat and strong black-haired wild boar that weighed more than 400 kilograms.

The wild boar's fangs were not weaker than that of a warthog. Furthermore, its skin was thick and its flesh was rough. Its body was covered in thick mud and it protected its body like an armor.

However, at this moment, it was pierced through by the sharp branches that were as sharp as spears and nailed there. It was dripping with blood and could not move.

That miserable scream suddenly turned into a terrified scream when it saw Chu Xiaoye.

It thought that this young lion was here to eat it.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye was not here to eat it.

Chu Xiaoye only wanted to comfort it and make it stop crying. Its body was already pierced and it could not survive no matter how much it howled. It would be better to die quietly, bravely and strongly.

However, this wild boar's roar was still loud and ear-piercing.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and made a prompt decision. He immediately jumped down and landed on it. He suddenly slapped its head and shouted. With a bang, he slapped its brains out and killed it completely\!

This time, it finally quietened down.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was thinking about whether to bring this wild boar away, Catherine, who was standing on top, suddenly let out a low growl and looked coldly at the forest in front of him.

A colorful tiger walked out of the forest calmly.

It was also attracted by the wild boar's roar.

It did not seem to have seen lions, but it instinctively became vigilant of the female lion baring her fangs in front of it.

However, it had the advantage in size and strength and was very familiar with the environment here. Therefore, it was not afraid and was very confident.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the bottom of the pit and did not show his head immediately. He used the strong smell of blood on the wild boar to hide his scent.

Since it was not a human, there was no need to be afraid.

However, since Catherine was so nervous, it was obvious that the other party was very strong. Then, he decided to continue staying here and catch the enemy by surprise, subduing the enemy in one move\!

In the world of animals, there was no such thing as despicable.

Furthermore, for felines, sneak attacks were an essential skill for them.

Chu Xiaoye could hear the sound of footsteps approaching and feel the other party's strong aura and the seriousness Catherine displayed.

He held his breath and slowly arched his body. He flicked out his sharp golden claws and looked up.

He was ready to attack\!
