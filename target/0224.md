Chapter 224: The Two White Lion Sisters

"Whoosh\!"

The two white lion sisters reacted extremely quickly. They immediately split up and fled in different directions.

The huge lion king hesitated for a moment before chasing after the older sister, Alice.

The other lions and female lions behind the lion king chased after the younger sister, Wei Li.

The two sisters were very fast. They instantly rushed out of the borders of the pride and fled into the forest.

The lion king chased out of the border and caught up to the hill, but he suddenly stopped and looked gloomily at the figure that had escaped into the forest.

He hesitated for a moment and ultimately did not chase after her.

The other lions and female lions immediately stopped and could only roar angrily at the escaping female cub.

The other lions and female lions immediately stopped and could only roar angrily at the escaping female cub.

However, since the other party had already escaped their territory, let's stop here.

After all, this forest owner was also strong and had never been on good terms with their pride. There was no need for them to start a war with their neighbors over two female lions.

Under the lead of the lion king, the pride turned around and returned.

Chu Xiaoye hid behind the rock and did not dare to move.

The members of this pride were all exceptionally strong, especially the giant lion king. Its claws were even larger than his head and it looked mighty and terrifying. It was definitely not to be trifled with\!

Obviously, this pride was Letty's pride.

Chu Xiaoye was hiding in their territory and could not help but feel a little guilty and uneasy.

Fortunately, the other party seemed to be in a fit of anger. After chasing away the female cubs and sisters, he left in a hurry, probably in a hurry to return to protect the cubs and did not patrol around again.

When the other party walked far away, Chu Xiaoye came out from behind the rock.

He turned around and looked at the forest. He suddenly thought of a terrifying thing.

The direction the white lion sisters fled in was the direction that Letty's two children were hiding in. If they discovered the cave and the two gray-haired lions, they would probably kill them.

After all, with their species, they would definitely look down on the two gray-haired lions. Furthermore, the other party was ill.

Between lions, there were either family or enemies.

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye immediately ran over.

Indeed.

When he ran near the cave, he heard the weak roars of the lion brothers.

The white lion sisters were standing curiously at the entrance of the cave, looking in. They were baring their fangs and provoking the two lions inside, seemingly letting the other party come out to fight.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye quickly ran over and roared.

These two young male brothers were his test subjects. He really wanted to know if his saliva could treat things other than wounds and antidotes, such as this strange disease.

Therefore, he had to deal with these two despicable female lions.

When the white lion sisters heard the roar, they turned around and looked at him. They were first stunned, then furious.

Especially her younger sister, Wei Li, who looked like she hated Chu Xiaoye to the core. She roared angrily and pounced at Chu Xiaoye. Her movements were rapid, and her claws were vicious and merciless\!

Seeing how fierce she was, Chu Xiaoye could only use his ultimate move. He suddenly turned around, aimed his butt at her, and curled his tail.

"Chi—"

When Wei Li saw this scene, she was shocked and hurriedly stopped in her tracks. However, because she stopped too abruptly, she fell onto the snow and rolled in front of Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to turn around and pounce on her. He slapped her mouth with a bang, causing her mouth to bleed and her head to spin.

When Alice saw this, she was shocked and furious. She hurriedly roared and rushed over to save him.

Chu Xiaoye bit the neck of the female cub in front of him and picked her up, quickly climbing up a big tree at the side.

Although the female cub was larger than him and its trunk was light and slippery, his strength and claws still allowed him to climb up easily.

Alice chased him to the tree and raised her head, roaring angrily. She was anxious and shocked. For a moment, she was at a loss.

She did not know how to climb trees.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and relaxed. He immediately picked up the female cub in his mouth and climbed up.

At this moment, he suddenly realized that not only did the female cub in his mouth not struggle or twist, but it also seemed to be dead. It tilted its head, lowered its limbs, and hung limp on him.

"Chi—"

Furthermore, he suddenly felt a warm current spray on his body.

The female cub peed her pants\!

Seeing that she was peeing non-stop, Chu Xiaoye hurriedly placed her on a thick branch and quickly left her side.

Wei Li was placed on a branch. As she shivered, she could not help but pee. Her eyes were tightly closed and her entire body was limp. She was so scared that she did not move.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch at the side and wanted to laugh when he saw this magical scene.

The little lioness looked so fierce and eager to fight on the ground. He did not expect her to be so frightened after coming to the tree. She did not even dare to open her eyes, which surprised him.

Was this the noble lion species on the snow mountain?

It made him laugh his head off\!

"Roar—"

Alice roared angrily under the tree and paced around anxiously. Clearly, she was also afraid of climbing the tree.

Looking at her sister's pitiful appearance, she jumped up and down anxiously, but there was nothing she could do.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and looked down at her with a teasing gaze.

When the sisters looked at him for the first time, they also looked down on him and were overbearing. They did not expect the tables to turn. It had only been a short time, and he should be looking at them like this.

"Call me daddy\!"

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked at the female cub under the tree, venting his anger.

Alice roared as she raised her head and circled the tree, looking like she wanted to jump up the tree but was very afraid.

It seemed that these two sisters were the same. They both had a very serious fear of heights.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at the female cub on the branch beside him. The female cub was still limp there with her eyes closed and not moving, as if she was dead.

He deliberately extended his claws and pushed her.

Wei Li immediately trembled and opened her mouth, letting out a whimper. Her eyes were still tightly closed, as if she was begging.

"I was wrong…"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her head and used his claws to forcefully open her tightly closed eyelids. He bared his teeth at her eyes and looked threatening.

"Call me Daddy\! Say Daddy, I was wrong\!"

Wei Li shivered and whimpered a few times in her throat, like a cat crying out.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to open her other eye, a low and dignified roar suddenly came from the forest below.

"Roar —"

Alice, who was under the tree, immediately trembled in fear. She turned around and looked at the forest on the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He felt that the roar was a little familiar and immediately looked down.

The forest fell into a short silence.

Alice, who was under the tree, froze in place and looked into the depths of the forest without moving.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree, his heart beating faster.

In the depths of the dense forest, a huge figure with colorful fur stepped on the snow and walked out of the forest silently, looking coldly at Alice under the tree.

When he saw this figure clearly, Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled and his face was filled with shock.

It was a tiger\!

This tiger was strong and almost equal to the lion in the pride just now. Although it was not as terrifying as the lion king, it was two to three times larger than the tiger Chu Xiaoye had seen previously\!

Just as Chu Xiaoye was feeling shocked, a roar suddenly sounded and another figure walked out of the forest.

Another tiger\!

However, this tiger's fur was snow white and it was even larger than the colorful tiger\!

The colorful tiger was a male and the white tiger was a female.

They seemed to be a couple, and were clearly attracted by Alice's roar.

At this moment, the two ferocious tigers walked side by side towards Alice under the tree, their eyes filled with cold killing intent.

This forest was the territory of their tribe\!

Facing these two ferocious tigers that were stronger and larger, Alice was clearly afraid. She wanted to escape, but she could not get down from the tree.

Furthermore, in this forest with varying slopes and snow, she might not be able to outrun these two ferocious tigers.

Alice seemed to be terrified.

She stood under the tree and stared blankly at the pair of tigers, not reacting at all.

Just as the two tigers were about to sprint, Chu Xiaoye suddenly climbed down from the tree and bit Alice's neck. He brought her up the tree and placed her beside her sister.

"Chi—"

Alice immediately lay on the branch and started to pee uncontrollably.

At this moment, the two tigers had already arrived under the tree. They looked up at the tree and let out low roars.

The colorful tiger suddenly jumped up the tree trunk and quickly climbed up the tree.

Although he was very big, it was much easier for him to climb up a tree than a lion.

Chu Xiaoye saw him quickly climb up and immediately took a few steps down. He lowered his head and looked at him coldly.

He had spent a lot of effort to kill that tiger back then. Now, this tiger was clearly stronger.

However, his strength had also increased a lot.

His golden claws were already hungry for blood\!

The colorful tiger stopped on the tree trunk that was only half a meter away from him and looked at him disdainfully, as if he was looking at a clown.

In front of him, Chu Xiaoye was like a child that had yet to grow up. Be it his size or muscles, he was much weaker than the other party.

"Roar —"

This colorful tiger suddenly opened its mouth and roared at him. The stench in its mouth sprayed on his face.

When ordinary animals heard this roar, they would have already trembled in fear and gone limp.

This colorful tiger seemed to want to tease him. After roaring, it suddenly rushed up and slapped his head fiercely with its huge claws\!

Chu Xiaoye had no doubt that if he was hit by this claw, his entire skull would shatter\!

Even a water buffalo could not withstand such a terrifying blow.

He did not dodge. He suddenly raised his right claw and attacked\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled and his three claws, which were gripping the tree trunk, almost tore the bark and he fell.

As for the colorful tiger, its body also trembled. With a whoosh, it did not grab tightly with one claw and tore off a piece of bark. Its body tilted and it almost fell from the tree trunk.

He quickly grabbed the tree trunk again and stabilized his body. He raised his head and looked at the young lion in front of him in disbelief.

This strength was not something that this size and age should have\!

The white female tiger under the tree was clearly a little surprised as well. She looked up with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye felt his arm go numb. However, the strange heat in his body quickly surged up his arm and restored him to his original state. His strength surged.

The colorful tiger stared at him for a few seconds and suddenly swung its palm again\!

A few sharp claws quietly popped out from his feet\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw also popped out.

However, this time, he did not take it head-on.

The other party's feet were huge and his claws were longer than his golden claws. Even if his golden claws grabbed the other party, his claws and even his legs would probably be seriously injured.

He was not stupid enough to make both sides suffer\!

Seeing that the colorful tiger's huge claws were coming, Chu Xiaoye suddenly pushed his two front claws against the tree trunk. His entire head and upper body were quickly raised and he narrowly avoided the huge claws\!

"Bang\!"

The colorful tiger's claws slapped heavily on the tree trunk\!

The entire tree suddenly swayed\!

"Whoosh\!"

Before the colorful tiger could retract its claws, Chu Xiaoye's raised upper body had already fallen. His raised claws flashed with golden light and he grabbed the other party's claws fiercely\!

Since the other party was merciless and wanted to kill him, he naturally would not be soft-hearted\!

With a "chi", blood sprayed out\!

The colorful tiger's huge foot was actually cut off by his golden claw\!

The broken foot splashed with blood and fell from the tree, landing on the head of the white female tiger under the tree.

The white female tiger stood there with her head raised and watched motionless.

"Roar —"

After a short moment of shock, the colorful tiger, whose feet had been cut off, suddenly let out a miserable roar. No one knew if it was because of the sudden pain or fear, but its entire body suddenly turned limp and fell from the tree trunk with a whoosh.

The white female tiger calmly jumped away from the tree.

"Bang\!"

Snow splashed as the colorful tiger landed heavily on the ground. It immediately rolled on the ground and roared. Blood surged from the broken wound.

However, the white female tiger did not look at him much. She still raised her head and looked at the young figure on the tree and the golden claws on his feet.

Her eyes were burning. Not only was there no anger or hatred, but she was also a little excited.

When the colorful tiger rolled in front of her and cried out for her help in taking revenge, the white female tiger suddenly raised her claws and pierced them into his abdomen with a "chi". She pulled ruthlessly and cut open his entire abdomen\!

From the beginning to the end, the white female tiger did not look at him.
