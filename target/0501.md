Chapter 501: The Princess' Crown

"Ah —"

The Queen seemed to have gone crazy. She suddenly roared and extended her hands, grabbing the corner of Lanisi's armor. She spat out blood and screamed hysterically, "Traitor\! You're all traitors\! You're the same as your slut sister. You've both betrayed your family and your king\! You'll be forever nailed to the pillar of shame of history and cursed by ten thousand people, never to turn around\!"

"Traitor?"

The princess still did not look back, but her face was filled with ridicule.

Vilis' eyes were filled with tears as she said with hatred, "Your Majesty, you're the traitor. You betrayed us and the entire elven race. Under your wise guidance, there are no more than ten thousand people in our elven race."

The Queen suddenly pointed at her with her bloody finger and screamed with a distorted face, "Vilis\! You bitch\! I should have thrown you into the dark dungeon long ago and let those violent orcs torture you to death\! And you, Denise, you little slut who's pretending to be mute\! Those violent orcs love to humiliate a good figure like yours the most\! Hahahaha…"

She pointed at Denise behind her with a ferocious expression and laughed crazily.

Denise looked at her calmly and did not speak.

The Queen continued to laugh crazily, her mouth flowing with blood as she screamed, "Traitor\! Traitor\! All of you will die a horrible death\! All of you will be imprisoned by the orcs until you die\! None of you will survive\! Hahahaha…"

"Pfft\!"

The princess pulled out her sword.

Blood sprayed and dyed her back red, causing her fiery red hair and fiery red armor to become even more red and gorgeous, like the setting sun on the horizon.

The Queen fell to the ground, but she still raised her head and did not die immediately.

She was still cursing viciously.

Lanisi finally turned around. There were no tears on her face or in her eyes.

She looked at her mother coldly as if she was looking at a stranger and said softly, "Mother, Annie only betrayed you and not us. She is the eternal pride and honor of our elves."

The Queen spat out blood and laughed.

Vilis' lips trembled as she said, "Princess Annie has already passed away. In the snow forest outside, she killed 52 Orc scouts alone and died from hundreds of arrows. Even if she died, she did not fall and was as tough as her sword. She knelt on the ground and faced her clansmen and country. She has a clear conscience\!"

The Queen finally stopped laughing.

Her red eyes were in a daze. Then, she finally lowered her head and lay on the ground.

The crown on his head slid down and all the glory withered and ceased to exist.

She had no honor to begin with.

It had never happened since she ascended the throne.

The princess held the sword stained with the Queen's blood and walked in front of the railing of the stone house. She calmly scanned the surrounding elves and the uneasy palace guards.

At this moment, the noise returned to silence, and the panic returned to shock.

The princess killed her mother and their honorable queen in front of everyone. What should they do?

"The queen is dead. From today onwards, I, Lanisi Cecilia, am the guardian of this city and the queen of all elves\!"

The princess suddenly raised her sword and said with a determined tone.

Her red hair fluttered and she stood elegantly, looking valiant and her gaze was determined like iron.

"Lanisi\!"

At this moment, a middle-aged noble sitting in another stone house not far away stood up.

He was dressed in silver armor and was tall and dignified. His gaze was like a blade as he said angrily, "You killed your mother. Your crime is extremely evil\! Killing your king deserves ten thousand deaths\! Are you, a crazy woman, worthy of being our queen? I'm your uncle and your mother's younger brother. This throne…"

"Whoosh —"

Before he could say anything, an arrow suddenly shot out. With a whoosh, it pierced into his throat and pierced through his entire neck\!

He covered his neck and staggered before falling to the ground, unable to say another word.

Denise's expression was calm as she continued to take out arrows and string them, looking at the others.

The princess raised her sword and continued to speak loudly, "I, Lanisi Cecilia, am the guardian of this city today and the queen of all elves\!"

"Lanisi\! You cruel bitch\! You killed my father\! I want…"

"Whoosh —"

An arrow shot out and an elf woman fell to the ground.

The princess continued to raise her sword and repeated her words.

On the seat of the next floor, a short-haired young man suddenly stood up. With a bang, he pulled out the sword at his waist and said angrily, "Lanisi killed our queen and killed our general\! Everyone, follow me and kill this demon woman\! Fight for the queen\! Fight for glory\!"

As he shouted, he raised his shield and blocked his chest.

However, his generous and furious cries did not get any response.

The person sitting beside him hurriedly retreated and pulled away from him.

The other nobles around him were silent.

The palace guards did not have any reaction.

The entire arena was suddenly terrifyingly quiet.

The embarrassed and terrified young man hurriedly said loudly, "Have you all forgotten the vow back then? When the Queen conferred you, you had all knelt in front of the Queen and swore to be loyal to her and fight for her\! Where is your dignity and courage?"

"They were eaten by dogs."

A mocking sound suddenly came from the crowd.

Then, some people mocked, "Viscount Aaron, we're not like you. We can obtain a title just by giving a few fun beasts and sucking up to you. We don't have your dignity and courage."

"Hmph, you must have contributed to the queen's mistakes over the years, right, Viscount Aaron?"

The young man was embarrassed and furious. "Bullshit\! I…"

"Whoosh —"

The bowstring vibrated and an arrow shot out, stabbing straight between the eyebrows\!

When he cursed angrily, he accidentally revealed a small portion of his head.

Although he was so far away and only revealed a little of his forehead, Denise's arrow still hit him accurately.

Viscount Aaron fell to the ground.

No one spoke again.

"Lanisi\! Your Majesty\! We will always be loyal to you\!"

The four female guards knelt down first and swore their loyalty.

Actually, they already belonged to the princess.

When the imperial guards saw this, they knelt and swore loyalty.

Then, the elven nobles, the aristocrats, and all the elves knelt down.

The sword in Lanisi's hand finally landed on the ground, and the crown on the ground would be worn on her head.

She suddenly turned around and looked at the bald lion that was still standing on the stone table. "You killed my brother. Although he deserves to die, the one who executed him should not have been a lion. You will pay the price for your actions."

Chu Xiaoye nodded and said, "Yes."
