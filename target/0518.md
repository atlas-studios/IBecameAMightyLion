Chapter 518: The Queen's Plea

"Ah\!"

The elven girl beside him immediately screamed and hurriedly rushed up to push away the figure. She said with a trembling voice, "Prince Morris\! Why? Why did you hurt Lord Night?"

The other female elves also let out sharp cries and turned pale in fear.

No one would have thought that after winning this battle, their only prince of the Elf Kingdom would suddenly kill their savior\!

Chu Xiaoye slowly turned around and looked at the elf boy behind him who had hatred in his eyes and a cold smile on his face. He revealed a shocked and confused expression. "Prince?"

Prince Morris did not hide the hatred on his face and the dark smile of success. He said sharply, "Lord Night, you killed my brother and my mother. Now, you still want to take away all the hope of the elf race. Do you think you have a chance?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the little boy with a distorted expression and saw the shadow of Prince William from his face and eyes.

"Lord Night, you're a lion, a beast, and an animal\! It's bad enough that you're coveting Lanisi's beauty, but you actually want to have designs on my Elven throne. Isn't your appetite too ugly?"

Morris grinned hideously, and madness appeared in his blue eyes. He suddenly gritted his teeth and said, "The throne is mine, not that b\*tch Lanisi's\! Even if she submits to you and fawns on you, wants to give you the throne, give you Denise, and give you all the b\*tches of the elves, she has to get my permission first\! Do you understand?"

Chu Xiaoye grabbed the dagger on his back and suddenly pulled it out.

Blood surged out and instantly dyed his clothes red.

He staggered a few steps and fell into the arms of an elf girl.

The other elven girls were terrified and cried, "Lord Night\! Lord Night, nothing must happen to you."

Prince Morris' eyes were red, and he was even more jealous. He grinned hideously and said, "It's useless. No matter how you bitches cry or pray, it's useless\! This animal is definitely going to die\! That bitch Lanisi will probably be so sad that she won't even be able to sit on the throne. Hahaha…"

"Bang\!"

An elf girl finally could not help but rush up and punch him in the face, causing him to fall to the ground.

Prince Morris cursed ferociously, "Bitch\! I'm your prince\! How dare you hit me\! I'll send you to the cell and give you to those strong orcs, making you wish you were dead\!"

The elf girl was so angry that her face was pale and her entire body was trembling.

"Lord Night…"

The girls cried and prayed.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his body and turned into a lion.

A bloody hole appeared on his back and blood surged in his golden fur. However, soon, the speed at which blood surged out started to slow down and finally stopped.

The dagger did not stab his heart. When he turned into a lion, the self-healing function of the wound suddenly erupted.

The familiar heat in his body finally returned.

"Indeed, I can only be a lion in the end…"

He thought to himself as his vision gradually turned dark and he quickly fainted.

Lanisi, who had received the news, rushed over with the help of Denise and Fei'er.

Catherine, who had been sent by Chu Xiaoye to save Vilis, ran over with the huge sword loli.

The sun was setting in the west, burning the clouds on the horizon, as if the flames in the canyon that had yet to be extinguished were burning layer after layer of corpses.

The battle was won, but no one could be happy.

The victorious elves were enveloped in another dark cloud.

The elven girls who were emitting all the light in the battle were sad, angry, ashamed, and hateful at this moment.

They had let down their benefactor and the young man who had saved all of them.

Fortunately, the youth did not die. The wound on his back was healing at a visible speed.

Catherine stayed in his room and did not let anyone in.

Denise and Fei'er guarded the door like two statues, motionless in the night.

The Queen waved the whip in her hand in the cell and slapped her twelve-year-old brother again and again. His entire body was covered in wounds and his face was covered in blood.

However, the boy was still grinning and cursing.

"The throne is mine\! It's mine\! Bitch, you killed your mother and snatched my throne. You still want to coexist with a wild beast and give our entire elven race to him\! You have committed a heinous crime and are a sinner of our elven race\! You should be like your Sister Alice, captured by the orcs and humiliated to death by a thousand or ten thousand orcs\! Hahahaha…"

The sound of the whip in the cell became even louder and faster.

Annie stood at the door of the cell, holding the sword at her waist with a cold gaze. She stopped for a long time, sighed imperceptibly, and turned to leave.

This was their only brother.

When Chu Xiaoye woke up, it was already midnight.

His back was still in pain, but he could clearly feel that he was much better.

His entire body was warm. It was not the comfortable temperature in the room, but the mysterious heat in his body.

He opened his eyes and looked at the roof, carefully recalling what happened before he fainted.

The battle was won and the orcs were wiped out in one fell swoop. The elf city and the elves were still alive, but as a hero, he was suddenly stabbed in the back while everyone was cheering for victory.

The one who stabbed him was actually Lanisi's younger brother and the prince of the Elven Kingdom.

If that knife pierced his heart, he would never wake up even if he turned into a lion.

He remembered his promise to the little girl named Lisa, but he would never protect a country that was preparing to take his life unless that person paid the price for his mistake.

Chu Xiaoye sat up in bed.

Catherine hurriedly stood up, her dark eyes flickering with tears.

Light footsteps came from outside and she spoke to Annie. "Is he awake?"

Fei'er, who was guarding the door, shook her head and said, "I don't know. That female cub doesn't let us in."

Annie stood outside the door for a while and prepared to leave.

Chu Xiaoye lifted the blanket and wore it by the bed. He said to the door, "Princess Annie, please come in."

The door was quickly pushed open.

Fei'er was the first to enter. She said with surprise and excitement, "Lord Night, are you okay? That's great\! Fei'er thought… thought that you would never wake up again."

As she spoke, the pink-haired elf actually shed tears and cried happily.

Annie and Denise walked in.

Denise knelt on the ground with one knee and lowered her head, feeling sad for her failure.

Of course, this was not her fault.

Chu Xiaoye said, "Denise, get up. I'm fine. This has nothing to do with you. You're the Queen's guard, not mine."

This silent silver-haired girl was still kneeling on the ground with her head lowered, like a child who had done something wrong, feeling guilty and dejected.

Annie walked close and bowed deeply to him. "Night, I'm sorry."

She apologized for her younger brother, her clansmen, and herself.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her with a gaze that was no longer as friendly as when he looked at the girl in the past. He said, "Princess, this is not your fault. You don't have to apologize. I only want to know how you and the Queen's brother, the prince called Morris, are doing."

Annie's lips moved, but she did not speak.

She lowered her head with a guilty expression.

Chu Xiaoye understood. He understood everything.

Even if the only remaining prince of the elves and their only brother made a mistake, what price could he pay?

Furthermore, he was still alive and not dead.

"Where's Her Majesty? Can I see her?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said.

Annie looked up and said with an ugly expression, "Night, are… are you leaving?"

Chu Xiaoye did not answer. His expression turned cold and he said, "Her Majesty once promised me that as long as I help her win this battle, she will give me anything I want. I know that this is nothing. I won't ask too much for her to kill your only brother. I just want something that can let Catherine and I leave here safely and live well elsewhere. My request is not overboard."

"Night…"

Annie's eyes trembled and she lowered her head again. "I'm sorry… I'm really sorry. Please don't leave, okay?"

Fei'er also walked over and cried, "Lord Night, I beg you, don't leave. Only by staying here can we live well. If you leave, what should we do?"

Denise was still kneeling on the ground with her head lowered and not moving.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the crying pink-haired girl in front of him and suddenly smiled. "If I let Her Majesty give you to me and let me take you away, would you be willing?"

Fei'er stopped crying and looked at him with tears in her eyes, stunned.

Then, the pink-haired girl suddenly knelt on the ground and wiped her tears. "Lord Night, the lives of all the elves were saved by you. Fei'er's life is naturally yours. If you need it, Fei'er will be extremely honored to follow you and never betray you\!"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He looked at her in a daze for a while before saying softly, "Get up. I was joking. This is your home. I won't be so cruel."

He looked at Annie and said, "Princess, let me ask you again. Can I see Her Majesty? She doesn't have to feel ashamed and not have the face to see me. I'm not that petty. That's just a child, right?"

Annie looked at him with trembling eyes. She stopped hesitating and turned around to leave the room.

At first, she walked very slowly. Then, she quickened her steps and her gaze became cold and determined.

The room fell silent.

The candlelight swayed and the wind blew at the window.

Denise was still kneeling on the ground like a stone statue.

Chu Xiaoye looked out the window. The night was hazy and the moon hid in the clouds. Even the stars disappeared.

Before long, Queen Lanisi walked into the room.

This girl, who had just turned 17, changed into a loose purple robe. She was wearing a thin tube dress and her red hair fell to her chest. She was elegant, noble, and beautiful, and her aura was obvious.

She paused at the door and walked in.

She lowered her head and slowly walked to the bed, her face filled with guilt and bitterness. She said softly, "Night, I know that apologizing is the most powerless thing. I only hope that I can thank you and make it up to you. As long as it's something I can do, you can say it. I will never refuse. I swear on my dignity as a queen and the honor of the elves\! It's just that…"

"I just hope that you won't leave."

She looked up at the young man on the bed and pleaded.

How rare was a queen's plea?

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said, "Is Your Majesty serious?"

The Queen's gaze trembled and she lowered her head again. Her voice was still begging. "Night, I've already punished Morris and will continue to punish him. He… He's my only brother. Please…"

"Your Majesty."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly smiled and said, "You're a queen, a high and mighty queen. You can't be so humble. A noble and glorious queen shouldn't be so humble towards a beast."

"Night, please, don't be like this."

Lanisi felt even more ashamed.

Without him, the elves would have long been gone and she, the queen, would have long died. In front of him, she was not a queen.

Chu Xiaoye restrained the smile on his face and stared at her begging face for a while before saying, "Your Majesty, I can stop pursuing this matter. However, I will never forgive you. Furthermore, your younger brother, Prince Morris, must come over personally and kneel in front of me to apologize. Even if he's only a child, he has to do so. My request is not overboard."

Lanisi's eyes lit up again and she revealed a grateful smile. She hurriedly said, "Of course not, it's not overboard. Night, wait for me. I'll bring him over to apologize to you immediately."

Then, she said to Annie, who was behind him, "Go and bring Morris over."

Annie turned to leave.

The atmosphere in the room became a little stiff again.

Fei'er moved a chair and placed it behind her. "Your Majesty, sit down. Your wounds have yet to heal."

Lanisi's wounds were indeed still very painful.

She sat down and looked at the young man in front of her. She suddenly smiled and said, "Night, I heard from Annie that you were joking with Fei'er, right?"

Fei'er smiled at the side and said, "Lord Night just teased me and said that he wanted to beg you to let me leave with him."

Lanisi looked at her and smiled. "Then, Fei'er, are you willing?"

The pink-haired girl, who was only fourteen years old, did not feel embarrassed at all. She nodded happily and said, "Yes, Your Majesty, Fei'er is naturally willing. Lord Night saved our entire elven race. Furthermore, Lord Night is so smart and nice. Fei'er will be very honored."

This pure elf girl did not seem to have thought of the Queen's face at all.

Chu Xiaoye said, "You forgot to mention the most important thing. Lord Night's looks are the merit you should follow."

Fei'er snorted and laughed. "Lord Night is so humorous."

Lanisi looked at the smiles on their faces and her gaze moved. She said with a smile, "Night, in the future, let Denise and Fei'er protect you together. One will help you hold your sword and the other will help you hold your clothes. This way, you can change your body at will."

Fei'er looked at Lord Night with sparkling eyes, her beautiful and exquisite face filled with anticipation. She took the initiative to say, "Lord Night, Fei'er will definitely protect you well. I will never be like today again. Fei'er swears."

Chu Xiaoye did not answer the Queen. He looked at Denise, who was kneeling at the door, and said, "Your Majesty, do you think Denise's nickname is Idiot?"

Lanisi turned around and smiled. "Denise has always been like this. She's been very stubborn since she was young."

Chu Xiaoye ordered, "Denise, if you still don't get up, I'll go over and sit on your head."

Denise finally got up and turned around to look elsewhere.

"She's shy."

Lanisi chuckled.

The atmosphere in the room started to become harmonious.

However, this did not last long.

Soon, Princess Annie walked into the room with the prince covered in wounds from the whipping.

"Bitch\! You b\*tches\! Let go of me\! I'm the king of the elves, I…"

As soon as he entered, Prince Morris cried out crazily again.

However, when he saw Chu Xiaoye sitting on the bed, the shouting stopped.

He seemed to have his throat grabbed and let out a chuckle. After dozens of seconds, he pointed at him with trembling fingers and said, "You… You…"

"Prince, I'm not dead yet."

Chu Xiaoye smiled.

"No\! Impossible\! I clearly pierced the dagger into your body\! How can you not be dead?"

Prince Morris' eyes were red and his face distorted again.

He could not believe it. He was unwilling and furious\!

"Morris\! Kneel\!"

The Queen stood up from the chair with a cold expression and reprimanded coldly, "Come over\! Kneel in front of Night and apologize for your mistake today\!"

The prince looked at her in disbelief and said, "You… You want me, the dignified prince of the Elf Kingdom, to apologize to this animal?"

"Bam\!"

The Queen walked over and suddenly slapped him in the face, causing his mouth to be filled with blood.

"Morris, you're the beast\!"

The Queen's body trembled as she looked at him hatefully and said, "If there was no Night this time, do you think you could still survive? Without Night, our entire elven race will be destroyed. Do you know that?"

The prince covered his burning face and grinned hideously. "Your Majesty, Your Majesty\! Then, do you know that if not for this animal, William would not have died tragically? You would not have made the decision to kill your mother back then\! And you would never have the chance to sit on the queen's throne\!"

Lanisi's face turned white and she clenched her fists.

He was telling the truth, but it was true that he made a mistake too.

The Queen closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Her face recovered its calm and she opened her eyes to look at him again. "Morris, go over and kneel in front of Night to apologize. Today's matter will end here."

Morris spat out a tooth and grinned hideously. "What if I can't? Your Majesty, do you want to kill your own brother after you kill your mother?"

"Clang\!"

Lanisi pulled out the dagger at her waist and looked at him coldly. "Morris, I won't kill you. However, I will make you never be able to stand up and never make any mistakes again."

The prince looked at her with red eyes, his face even more distorted, and the muscles on his face trembled.

"Alright\! I can go and kneel in front of that animal to apologize to him. However, Your Majesty, you have to kneel in front of Mother and William's graves to apologize to them\!"

Morris gritted his teeth.

Lanisi stared at him with a sharp gaze. After dozens of seconds, she slowly put the dagger in her hand back to her waist and said coldly, "Alright."

"Then, deal\!"

A dark smile appeared on Prince Morris' face. He said, "To be honest, I don't want to die, nor do I want to be crippled. I'm still young and have yet to enjoy women. Look at you, you're surrounded by the beautiful women of our Elf Kingdom. Tsk tsk."

He looked lasciviously at Denise, Fei'er, and even his two sisters and chuckled. "I'll live well and enjoy the happy life of a prince. Dear sister, I believe that you can definitely fulfill these small requests of your only brother, right?"

With that said, he strode to the bed, bent his knees, and knelt upright on the ground. He grinned and said, "Lord Night, Prince Morris apologizes to you. I was wrong today. In the future, we can definitely be friends. The type Lord Night likes is just like me. At that time, we can… Hehehehe…"

"Morris\! Shut up\!"

Lanisi turned around and reprimanded with a cold expression.

Prince Morris knelt on the ground and shrugged. He turned around and looked at her. "Your Majesty, I'm apologizing to Lord Night according to your orders. If you want me to stop, I'll stop."

He prepared to get up.

Lanisi suddenly rushed over and suddenly raised her foot to step on his shoulder. She pressed his upper body to the ground and said coldly, "Apologize\!"

Prince Morris lay on the ground, his forehead almost touching Chu Xiaoye's shoes.

He clenched his fists and trembled as he said loudly, "Lord Night\! I apologize for my rashness and mistakes today\! I beg your forgiveness\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked down at him and did not speak.

Lanisi's foot was still firmly stepping on his shoulder. She said coldly, "Continue to apologize\! Until Night is satisfied\!"

Morris said hoarsely, "Lord Night\! I'm sorry\! I, Morris, am a bastard, an ungrateful bastard who repays kindness with ingratitude\! Please forgive me\!"

The Queen looked at the youth on the bed, her eyes showing pain and begging.

Chu Xiaoye finally said, "Get up. This matter ends here."

Lanisi let go of her foot and looked at him gratefully. She said with a trembling voice, "Night, thank you."

"No need."

Chu Xiaoye stood up, walked over, and hugged her gently.

Lanisi was stunned. Her fair face suddenly blushed and her eyes revealed a trace of panic and shock, but she did not refuse.

Prince Morris, who was kneeling on the ground, raised his head and opened his mouth. Just as he was about to speak, a dagger suddenly pierced into his open mouth with a whoosh\!

Then, he pulled out the dagger and stabbed it into his throat again\!

His eyes bulged and his body trembled, his face filled with disbelief and despair.

Chu Xiaoye slowly let go of the queen, pulled out the dagger, and gently stuck it back into her waist.

He looked at the trembling beautiful girl in front of him and said softly, "Your Majesty, now, I really forgive him… He's still a child. I can only do this."
