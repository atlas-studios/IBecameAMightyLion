Chapter 588: Beast Fighting Arena

Near the edge of the grassland.

There was a town here.

At this moment, the town welcomed fleeing humans from all over.

The people rubbed shoulders and chatted and laughed. It was extremely lively and they were not dejected by their loss.

In the middle of the town, a simple colosseum was built.

The venue was surrounded by people who had come to watch the fun.

The crowd was in high spirits and could not stop shouting, cheering for the two ferocious beasts fighting to the death.

It was a mutated wolf and a dog that had been injected with the T-rex gene.

The two ferocious beasts were soon covered in wounds and dripping with blood. However, before they bit the other party to death, neither of them retreated or stopped.

The surrounding spectators watched excitedly as they placed bets.

"Roar —"

Finally, the mutated wolf bit the dog's neck.

The battle ended and the cheers of humans sounded around.

However, the mutated wolf was already riddled with wounds. Even if it could survive, it was useless.

In order to make the spectators more excited, a strong black man held a spear and walked out from behind the open iron bars towards the mutated wolf.

The mutated wolf seemed to have sensed something and immediately bared its fangs, letting out a fierce cry.

However, it was already too injured. It stood there with difficulty.

The black man held the spear and immediately rushed over. Then, with a whoosh, he threw the spear in his hand and pierced the mutated wolf's neck.

The mutated wolf howled in pain and fell to the ground.

The surrounding crowd on the stands erupted in enthusiastic cheers and applause again.

After the black man left and the corpses of the two ferocious beasts were dragged away, two more ferocious beasts were released from different directions.

It was a big wild boar with thick skin and rough flesh, as well as a leopard.

These two animals did not seem to have been injected with genes by humans, but they had mutated. They were much larger than before and looked much stronger.

Under the cries of humans, the big wild boar roared and rushed up.

The leopard dodged agilely, jumped left and right, and jumped back and forth. When the big wild boar was panting from exhaustion, it suddenly jumped over and landed on the big wild boar's back, biting its neck\!

The big wild boar roared and swayed its body, charging around crazily.

The leopard lay on it tightly. Two rows of fangs suddenly exerted strength and bit its neck off.

Soon, the big wild boar fell to the ground and was still crying out miserably, but it could not stand up again.

The crowd cheered.

Before the victorious leopard could rest, the iron bars opened and a female lion was let out.

The leopard started to retreat in fear, then ran, as if it wanted to run into the iron bars, but the bars were already closed.

The female lions rushed up like arrows.

The leopard had no choice but to bare its fangs and fight.

But soon, it was pressed to the ground by the female lion and its neck was bitten.

The leopard widened its terrified eyes and flailed its limbs with all its might, but it was useless. Soon, it died.

The lionesses won, but humans did not let them leave.

The iron bars opened and two strong hyenas were let in.

When enemies met, they would be jealous\!

The two sides immediately fought.

The female lions fought one against two and were not at a disadvantage.

However, its endurance could not compare to that of the two spotted hyenas. Before long, it slowed down.

When it bit the mouth of one of the hyenas, another hyena that was pretending to be afraid suddenly attacked from behind and bit its butt. With a whoosh, it actually tore off a large piece of flesh from behind.

The female lion jumped in pain and roared as she turned around to go.

Then, the hyena behind had already fled.

The hyena that had its mouth bitten suddenly attacked in anger and bit its back again\!

The female lion roared and turned around, but the hyena also bit its back and turned around.

When the other hyena saw this, it immediately rushed up and bit the lioness's hind leg.

The two spotted hyenas exerted strength together and dragged the female lion to the ground, starting to drag her and run on the grass.

The female lions let out miserable cries, but they could not resist.

When it was dizzy from being dragged, the two spotted hyenas immediately started to use their fangs to tear the flesh behind it and swallow it.

The female lion turned around helplessly to bite, but the two spotted hyenas bit its back and continued to circle.

Soon, the female lions could no longer resist and could only roar miserably.

The two spotted hyenas started to bite and wolf from behind it.

The surrounding crowd was extremely excited as they watched, shouting endlessly.

Before long, the female lion died completely.

Just as the two spotted hyenas were chowing down, the iron bars opened and a lion with a lush mane walked out.

The two spotted hyenas immediately faced a great enemy and stopped swallowing.

The lion roared angrily and rushed up.

The two spotted hyenas did not have the courage to resist at all. They immediately dispersed and fled, running around the open space of the Bestial Battle Arena.

The lion pounced on one and bit its neck.

The other hyena was terrified. It howled and begged for mercy as it ran for its life.

However, the venue was too small. When the lion was angry, it was very fast and caught up to it in an instant, pushing it to the ground.

The hyena roared in fear and did not dare to resist. Its neck was bitten off by the lion.

"What a powerful lion\!"

On the stands, people cried out excitedly.

Between two beautifully dressed women sat a young man wearing a hat.

The young man had short silver hair and was exquisite and handsome. His blue eyes were staring at the colosseum below with a burning gaze.

The beautiful woman on the left placed her hand on the young man's thigh. As she rubbed it gently, she looked at him coquettishly and whispered, "My dear, are you as powerful as that lion? I really want to see it."

The young man retracted his gaze and looked at her. He revealed a smile and said, "It's said that lions can only last for a few seconds. Does Madam like this?"

As for the beautiful woman on his right, she was trembling.

She was held hostage by this youth.

The beautiful woman on the left chuckled and continued to stroke the youth's thigh. "It's okay. It'll be fine if you come a few more times. It's the same."

At this moment, the iron bars below opened.

A spotted ferocious tiger walked out with its head held high.

The victorious lion suddenly felt nervous when it saw this ferocious beast. It immediately narrowed its eyes and waited solemnly.

The humans on the stands immediately cheered even more excitedly.

Of these two ferocious beasts, one was the king of the forest and the other was the king of the grassland. Now that they had met, it would definitely be another exciting battle.

The gamblers immediately started betting.

"My dear, guess who will win?"

The beautiful woman on the left felt her body go limp and almost stuck to the young man. She bit his ear and whispered.

"Eh?"

She suddenly realized that this young man's ears seemed to be wrong.

Just as she was about to push aside the young man's beautiful silver hair, the young man wrapped his arm around her waist and turned around to kiss her red lips. He said softly, "I guess you're a lioness in heat."

The beautiful woman immediately turned even softer and climbed onto the young man's thigh. She turned around and giggled, saying charmingly, "My handsome king, you're right. Let me, a lioness in heat, serve you."

As she spoke, she lowered her head.

"Roar—"

The two ferocious beasts in the field immediately fought.

The young man looked down coldly and ignored the woman's nonsense.

The woman on the right was still trembling.
