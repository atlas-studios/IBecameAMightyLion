Chapter 555: Fat Girl's Smoking Addiction

"Boom\!"

Chu Xiaoye was pushed to the ground.

If not for his good physique, he would have been crushed to death by this fat fellow\!

"Where's the smoke? Where's the smoke? Hurry up and fart\!"

The fat girl turned him around and eagerly placed her nose on his butt. She did not care about the shocked gazes of her subordinates and was so excited that her fat trembled non-stop.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly rolled to the side and jumped up. He raised his hand and said, "Stop\!"

The fat girl was extremely excited. She looked at him excitedly and said, "Smelly fart king, you became an elf?"

Then, her expression suddenly changed and she said anxiously, "Can't you fart after becoming an elf?"

She immediately looked dejected and desperate.

Chu Xiaoye smiled and said, "I've become an elf. I can't fart anymore. However, I can still turn back into a lion. When I turn back into a lion, I guarantee that I'll have enough smelly farts\!"

"Really?"

The fat girl immediately seemed to be revived and became excited.

Chu Xiaoye smiled and said, "Of course it's true. However, I don't have enough energy now. I'm tired and hungry. I have to replenish some energy. When I rest and recover my energy, I can return to being a lion again."

The fat girl immediately pulled his hand and said, "Let's go\! Let's go back to the village to eat\! Eat meat and drink wine in big mouthfuls. When the time comes, fart well. If you can't satisfy me, hmph, don't blame me for not remembering our old relationship\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly pointed at Lanisi and the others and said, "They're my friends. You can't hurt them\!"

The fat girl slanted her eyes and glanced at the girls. She had an expression that said she understood and said disdainfully, "Don't lie to me. It's clearly your harem\! Even if you become an elf, it's difficult to change the playfulness of a lion. Kid, is it?"

Chu Xiaoye was embarrassed for a moment. His heart skipped a beat and he immediately chuckled. "Alright, you saw through me. They are indeed my… wives."

The orcs were eyeing them covetously. Only by saying this would Lanisi and the others be safe. No matter how the fat girl changed, she was still his friend. He had once helped her. Since these girls were his wives, she would naturally protect them.

Indeed, hearing him say this, the fat girl smiled and said, "Since they're all your wives, don't worry. Whoever dares to touch them will definitely not survive until tomorrow\!"

"Did you hear that?"

She turned her head and looked at the orc leader beside her, saying ferociously.

The orc leader's legs turned limp in fear. He immediately knelt on the ground again and said with a trembling voice, "Yes\! I understand. I'll give the orders now. If any blind person dares to touch these honorable guests, I'll take his life\!"

Chu Xiaoye was honored to sit on the back of the tall female elephant with the fat girl.

Lanisi and the others sat on the backs of the other elephants.

Catherine followed behind the elephant silently.

In the evening, they came to a super village that was set up like a city.

Chu Xiaoye clicked his tongue in wonder at the tall city wall and city tower. "Fat girl, are these all yours?"

The fat girl said proudly, "Of course\! I'm the boss here, and everything here is naturally mine. If I did not lead the elephant team to fight, they would have long died, let alone build this village."

Chu Xiaoye asked in confusion, "From what you said, you should have come in very early, right? When did you become an orc?"

The fat girl frowned and thought carefully for a moment. "I don't know either. When I migrated with the elephant herd that day, I suddenly passed through a layer of something that looked like a water curtain. As I walked, I was so hungry that I could not walk. Then, I was suddenly surrounded by a group of orcs and was grabbed by them to be their mounts. After a few days, I was slapped until I could not take it anymore. I resisted, and after killing a few orcs, I ran out. Finally, I came here and saw my current body. For some reason, when we saw her, both of us wanted to kill each other, but in the end, I won. In the end, I became like this. Smelly fart king, do you know what happened? How did you become an elf?"

Chu Xiaoye smiled bitterly and said, "It's a long story. I'm afraid you won't understand if I tell you this."

The fat girl waved her hand and said, "Then let's not talk about it. I hate long stories. Let's go back and drink wine and eat meat and live happily. If you like women, there are many in my village. They are all abducted or bought from elsewhere and some live here. No matter which one you like, I can get them for you. I only have one request…"

"Bullshit\!"

The two of them said in unison, then laughed out loud.

After entering the village, everyone was very respectful of the fat girl. The men were a little afraid, but the women and children were very close to her. They took the initiative to surround her and talk, asking who Chu Xiaoye was.

"It must be the captive of the leader. Look at his ears gradually and his skin is white. He should be an elf."

"Does the village leader sleep with this little elf? Will he be crushed to death?"

"Shh, lower your voice. Be careful that the camp leader is angry."

Many people were whispering at the side, pointing at Chu Xiaoye and whispering non-stop, their faces filled with curiosity.

The fat girl could only say loudly, "This is my friend, my good friend\! Everyone, don't be rude\!"

"Yes, Chief\!"

Everyone agreed respectfully.

The dinner was sumptuous.

All sorts of wild animals, all sorts of exquisite fruits and snacks.

The fat girl's greatest hobby was eating, be it farts or food.

Lanisi and the others were rather restrained. They were surrounded by strong and fierce orc. Even if this leader was their Lord Night's friend, they were uneasy.

The fat girl saw their worry and restraint and immediately told the male orcs to scram and let some women and girls come in to accompany the guests.

This way, Lanisi and the others were much more at ease.

"Smelly fart king, you have good taste. These little elves are not bad. They have a figure, a face, and a face. They are all tender. You must have put in a lot of effort, right?"

The fat girl drank and chatted with Chu Xiaoye. She felt very happy.

Chu Xiaoye chuckled and said, "Yes, you put in a lot of effort."

They almost died.

The fat girl tilted her mouth and smiled naughtily. "Then I'll probably be as tired as a dead dog every night. I won't be able to get up the next day, right? Tell me, how many do you want to enjoy in one night?"

"Cough, cough\!"

Chu Xiaoye spat out a mouthful of wine. He turned around and saw Lanisi looking at him with a faint smile. The other girls were also blushing and eavesdropping.

That was why people could not lie. Otherwise, this lie would become bigger and harder to clean up.

"Two or three."

Chu Xiaoye whispered indistinctly.

However, the girls below still heard it clearly.

The huge sword loli glanced at him with disdain and ridicule.

Fei'er's face was red as she looked at him faintly, as if she was saying: You're lying\! You didn't enjoy me at all\!

Lanisi endured her laughter and still had a faint smile.

Chu Xiaoye ate a lot of meat and drank a lot of wine.

When the crowd was about to disperse, the fat girl pointed at the orc girls below and said drunkenly, "Smelly fart king, choose a few and I'll serve you tonight. Don't be polite to me. Choose as many as you want. However, don't delay your farting."

The orc girls lowered their heads shyly and timidly. Their faces were red as they peeped shyly and happily at the handsome young elf in front of them, their eyes filled with anticipation.

Chu Xiaoye was also drunk. He looked at people with double images and was dizzy. He pointed down and was about to point at one of the girls when his finger was suddenly grabbed by a jade hand.

Lanisi grinned and went in front of him. "Night, choose me."

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "Alright, it's you."

Lanisi smiled and helped him up. She deliberately said, "Is one enough? Why don't we choose another one?"

Chu Xiaoye extended his hand again, but he suddenly felt a pain in his waist. He hurriedly put down his hand to grab it.

Lanisi blinked and said, "One is enough? Alright, let's not choose. Let's go back and sleep."

Then, the Elven Queen turned around and said to the fat girl, "Chief, let's go back. You should rest early too."

The fat girl lay on the table like a pool of mud. She waved her hand and said vaguely, "Go… go. Serve him well. If you can't, let me do it. I… I can do it too."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt a chill in his heart and sobered up a little. He hurriedly quickened his steps.

Fei'er ran over and supported him on the other side. She looked at her queen with a red face and whispered, "Your Majesty, are you enough alone? Will it be very difficult? Do you need me to help you?"

Seeing that this innocent girl had learned bad things, Lanisi's heart ached. She said with a serious expression, "Fei'er, you're still a child. You have to be reserved and respect yourself, understand? You've also worked hard for the day. Go back and rest. I'll be enough to serve the night alone."

"Oh."

Fei'er was a little disappointed.

Hence, in the dead of the night, our Elven Queen helped a certain young elf into the room.

They did not come out until dawn.

"Sister Denise, did you hear that? There seems to be a strange noise next door."

Fei'er, who was sleeping next door, leaned against the wall and placed her ear on it as she asked curiously.

Denise lay in bed with her eyes open and looked at the silver full moon outside the window. She did not seem to have heard her and did not respond.

"Sister Denise, there really is a strange sound. His Majesty seems to be asking for help. Let's go over quickly?"

Fei'er said anxiously.

He did not know if he was really stupid or pretending to be stupid.

Denise had already closed her eyes. The bright moonlight shone through the window and landed on her silver hair and snow-white skin, making her look like a sleeping moonlight fairy. She was breathtakingly beautiful.

Fei'er was stunned for a moment before she muttered, "Sister Denise is so beautiful."

Then, she magnified her voice and said, "But Sister Denise, Her Majesty is really crying for help again. I even heard Her Majesty crying. Lord Night is definitely not satisfied with Her Majesty's service and is bullying Her Majesty. Let's go over quickly\!"

Denise finally could not help but sit up and say, "Fei'er, shut up\! Come and sleep\!"

Fei'er pouted, but she stayed close to the wall. After a while, she said weakly, "Alright, Sister Denise, go to sleep. Fei'er won't disturb you anymore."

Denise lay down again and closed her eyes, but she tossed and turned and could not sleep.

"It seems that Sister Denise is also worried about Her Majesty."

Fei'er thought to herself, but she stuck her ear to the wall and continued to eavesdrop.

The next day, when the sun was high in the sky, Chu Xiaoye and Lanisi came out of the room.

When they came to knock, Fei'er opened the door and revealed two black circles. She looked weak, as if she had sneaked out last night to do something bad and had just returned to rest.

Denise also walked out. She also had two black circles, but she was a little lighter than Fei'er.

"What's wrong? You didn't sleep last night?"

Lanisi asked in confusion.

Fei'er blushed and did not dare to say anything.

Denise only grunted.

Lanisi held in her laughter and said, "It seems that you're not too tired. Usually, it's not easy to fall asleep when you just come to an unfamiliar place. However, if you're too tired, you'll fall asleep soon."

As she spoke, she looked at the elf youth beside her and blinked. "Am I right? Night?"

Chu Xiaoye's face was slightly red. He yawned and said, "Yes."

He was drunk last night and was exhausted by this young queen.

Breakfast was still very sumptuous.

The fat girl ate the meat and said eagerly, "Smelly fart king, how is it? Have you recovered enough to transform after a night of rest?"

Chu Xiaoye tried and shook his head. "Not yet. I think it will take another two to three days."

The fat girl sighed and was clearly a little disappointed. However, she soon smiled and said, "It's okay. I'll wait for another two to three days. However, it shouldn't delay your journey, right?"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and smiled. "No, it doesn't matter how late it is."

Of course, it did not matter how late it was.

He wished he could fly to the destination and quickly bring her back.

As long as he did not fetch Little Curly Tail and the others, he could not be at ease.

However, he could not be anxious now.

If he stayed here for a few days, he might walk faster.

When Chu Xiaoye saw that she was almost done eating, he said, "Fat girl, do you have any transportation tools here? It's just that you can walk quickly in the forest and have endurance. It can last for a long time."

The fat girl thought for a moment and said, "Warhorses, the speed and endurance you mentioned can only be done by warhorses that take off their armor."

Chu Xiaoye said, "Then, how about you give me a few warhorses?"

The fat girl said without thinking, "Of course you can. It's just a few warhorses. Even if you let me send you a few girls to enjoy on the way, I'll be willing to. As long as you…"

"Bullshit\!"

The two of them said in unison and laughed.

The fat girl suddenly said, "By the way, smelly fart king, I suddenly remember that there's another mode of transport that you might like."

Chu Xiaoye asked curiously, "What?"

The fat girl said, "Pterodactyl\!"

Chu Xiaoye perked up and said in disbelief, "You have that thing in your village?"

The fat girl smiled mysteriously and said, "So, no, not now. However, there will be soon."

When she said this, she no longer kept him in suspense and said, "Three days later, a team escorted two pterodactyl to the Fire Spirit Mountain 50 kilometers away. The buyer there had already bought these two pterodactyls. The ones escorting the pterodactyls were the orc army. There were quite a number of them, about 500\. I'm preparing…"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "Fat girl, do you have use for those two pterodactyls to be useful?"

The fat girl thought for a moment and said, "It's not very useful."

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "That's right. You live in this forest and there are trees everywhere. The terrain is dangerous and it's difficult for pterodactyls to land. What use is it? You also said that the orc army is escorting the pterodactyls. Furthermore, since the buyer of Fire Spirit Mountain can afford these two pterodactyls, he's probably not simple, right?"

The fat girl said indifferently, "Do you think I'm simple?"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "I don't think it's necessary. You're risking the lives of your clansmen. Do you know?"

The fat girl looked at him and said, "Don't you need a pterodactyls?"

Chu Xiaoye was a little touched. "That's even less necessary. If you provoke the army, your village will definitely not be able to survive. It's enough that we have war horses. Fat girl, I appreciate your intentions, but I won't accept it."

The fat girl said, "Alright, I was just saying. Do you think I'm really stupid to provoke the army for no reason? We have a deal with the armies of the four countries. We won't easily offend each other."

As the two talked, they ate a lot more meat.

Chu Xiaoye finally knew why she became so fat.

If he stayed for a few more days, he would probably become a big fatty.

After breakfast, the fat girl rode the elephant and brought them around the village. Then, they left the village and walked towards the forest at the back.

After passing through the forest, there was actually a large field in front of him. The field was filled with strange plants with bright red and demonic flowers. Before he could approach, he could smell a charming fragrance.

"What is this?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at it carefully. He did not want it to be a crop he was familiar with.

The fat girl rode on the elephant and said in high spirits, "This is called Soul-Hooking Grass. It can be refined into Soul-Hooking Pills and is extremely expensive. Every year, after harvesting, it will be sold out. It's one of the most profitable industries in my village."

Chu Xiaoye realized that there were a large number of orcs patrolling by the distant garden on their mounts.

"Soul-Hooking Pill?"

When Doya heard this, her face turned pale. "I've heard Grandpa mention this thing before. I heard that the fragrance of pills is extremely tempting. Once you eat one, you can't stop eating. You have to eat it every day, as if you're possessed. Many factions are secretly buying this pill and controlling those who work for them. Even someone with strong willpower will not be able to control themselves after eating one. Grandpa said that this is a demonic pill and they won't touch it."

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat when he heard that.

The fat girl turned around and looked at Doya. She said with a smile, "You, this orc concubine, know quite a lot. Don't worry, I won't let you eat it. I won't let anyone in the village eat this thing. I'll just take it out to earn money and never let my own people eat it."

Chu Xiaoye frowned and said, "Fat girl, this is ultimately a harmful thing."

The fat girl looked into the distance and said, "What is it that doesn't hurt people? Is it a hunter's bow or a hunter's spear? Or is it a hunter's trap? Or is it delicious food? Nothing in this world doesn't hurt people."

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he looked at her and said, "Where's your elephant herd? And your mother?"

The fat girl shrugged and said, "They're all dead. Just like the elephant herd you saw yesterday, they were killed by hunters with spears and bows."

Chu Xiaoye fell silent.

No wonder she kept mentioning the word "hunter" just now. Her hatred had already been engraved in her bones.

Everyone had their own way of living. He could persuade them, but he could not force them.

Alisa had changed, as had the fat girl.

Of course, he had changed too.

He knew that the future Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, the cold father, and the others might also change.

However, if they stayed on the grassland, they would not change.

The environment made them change. If they did not change, they would be eliminated.

"Save me\!" "Save me\!"

Right at this moment, a thin woman suddenly ran out of the field not far away. Behind her, two orcs really raised their whips and chased after her.

The sounds of the leather whips were exceptionally loud.

The woman was slapped to the ground. She cried and rolled a few times before running over.

She saw the fat girl riding on the elephant and cried, "Chief\! Save me\! Save me\!"

However, the fat girl sat on the elephant and looked coldly, not reacting.

The woman ran over and knelt in front of the elephant, kowtowing and begging for help.

The two orcs also ran over quickly and knelt on the ground to report, "Chief, this person sneaked into the ground to steal the Soul-Hooking Grass and was discovered by us. We originally wanted to bring her back to the camp and ask Lord Bei Ya to punish her, but she kept resisting and was unwilling to return."

The woman hurriedly kowtowed and said, "Chief, save me. I didn't steal it. I really didn't steal it. I was wronged\!"

One of the orcs hurriedly took out a bundle of Soul-Hooking Flowers from his pocket and said, "This was all discovered in her pocket. I did not wrong her. If you don't believe me, you can check her pocket. There must be pollen inside."

Only then did the woman beg for mercy while crying. "Please spare my life, Chief. My man ate a Soul-Hooking Pill outside. Ever since he returned two days ago, he went crazy at home, abused me and my children, and forced me to come and steal the Soul-Hooking Grass. If I don't stay, he will beat my children to death."

The fat girl sat on the elephant and looked at her a few times. Then, she said to the orc patrolling soldier, "Take her back to the village first and ask who her husband is. Then, bury her and her husband together. As for their children, bring them to the orphanage. There will be people helping their children there."

"Yes, Chief\!"

Two orc patrolling guards grabbed the woman and dragged her away.

The woman cried out in fear, "Spare me, Chief\! Spare me, Chief\! I don't want to die\! I still have children, I still have children\!"

The fat girl ignored her, as if she had done something insignificant. She looked at Chu Xiaoye and said, "This kind of thing often happens. Many people can't resist temptation, no matter how loyal they are."

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to agree and said, "There are still many people who can resist temptation."

The fat girl said with a mocking expression, "Is there? That's because there's not enough temptation. I told you that ever since I came here, I've seen too many good people turn bad, loyal subjects turn evil, and righteousness turn evil. As long as there's enough temptation, day can turn into night and night into day. Do you believe me?"

Chu Xiaoye did not believe her, but there was no need to argue with her.

The fat girl pointed in front and smiled. "You'll definitely be interested in the things in front. I raised a group of pets. Just like us on the grassland in the past, we worked hard to survive there and fought for survival."

"Pets?"

Chu Xiaoye was a little curious.

The fat girl smiled and said, "Yes, pets—a group of humans who did not cover their bodies and became wild beasts."
