Chapter 361: Untitled

The effect was obvious.

The defeated hyenas that had fled were already terrified and had no strength to fight or will to fight. They peed their pants and did not even dare to look back when they were killed by Blue Eyes and the pride.

When the lions returned with victory, the cold father and the few female lions returned to their former glory.

Brave and confident, proud and mighty.

Chu Xiaoye went forward at the right time and encouraged, "Well done\!"

The cold father glanced at him proudly and ignored him. He turned around and walked to the grass at the side to lie down, continuing to maintain the dignity and coldness of a lion king.

It was as if he had returned to the past, when he was a king whose mane fluttered and his roar repelled the enemy.

The members of the pride had to follow his orders.

Chu Xiaoye did not disturb his entertainment. He came under the tree and jumped up, carrying the little girl on the tree.

After landing, the little girl did not get down immediately. Instead, she rode on his back and hugged his neck tightly with her two arms. Her exquisite face was buried in his increasingly dense golden mane, and her eyes were filled with longing.

At this moment, she seemed to treat this young lion king as her only family and support.

"Whoosh\!"

Tilly suddenly jumped down from the tree and rode on her back. Like a pyramid, she pressed Chu Xiaoye to the bottom and laughed out loud.

The little girl let out a scream and was shocked. At the same time, she was in pain from the pressure.

Chu Xiaoye's body suddenly trembled and he threw them to the ground. Then, he walked to Tilly's side and rode on her without any explanation. He called for Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, and Molly to ride her.

Chu Xiaoye's body suddenly trembled and he threw them to the ground. Then, he walked to Tilly's side and rode on her without any explanation. He called for Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, and Molly to ride her.

However, just as he ran close, Tilly suddenly jumped up from the ground and sent Chu Xiaoye flying. Then, she slapped him and sent him flying with a bang.

Little Curly Tail fell to the ground in a sorry state. He was dizzy and saw stars.

At this moment, he woke up.

This female cub with snow-white fur was not someone he could provoke casually.

Those sharp golden claws that were like his brother's, her lightning-like speed, and all sorts of strange combat skills were enough to torture him until he cried for his parents.

"Chiâ€”"

Seeing his sorry state, Mei Mei immediately gloated at him and mocked him.

Beside him, Molly could not help but grin and mock.

However, the female cub seemed to have forgotten her identity and strength.

Little Curly Tail immediately jumped up and rushed towards her.

Molly panicked and hurriedly hid behind Mei Mei. Seeing that Mei Mei could not stop her, she immediately ran to Aisha's side. However, Little Curly Tail still chased after her relentlessly.

Molly was helpless and could only run behind the cold father.

When the cold father saw that the female cub had attracted disaster and that unfilial son was charging over ferociously, he immediately lowered his head and pretended to sleep, even snoring.

Molly could only turn around and charge into the depths of the bushes.

Little Curly Tail roared and chased after him.

Chu Xiaoye watched their figures run far away and silently cheered for that kid. "Ride her\!"

The defeat of the hyenas also frightened the surrounding carnivores, who wanted to fish for benefits, and they fled far away.

This grassland quickly returned to calm.

Chu Xiaoye instructed everyone to take the time to rest.

After he climbed up the tree, he was not sleepy at all and stared blankly at the moon above him.

He looked at the moon in a daze, and Catherine, who was in the grass under the tree, looked at him in a daze.

The little girl sat under the tree and carefully trimmed her nails with a knife.

To lions, nails were weapons, but to her, nails were burdens. The longer her nails were, the more inconvenient it was for her to move.

Rustling sounds suddenly came from the dense grass.

Of course, she could not hear him.

The low and soft grass swayed slightly.

She could not see it either.

A small dark green snake followed the scent and climbed up silently along her white leather shoes. It raised its head and spat out its scarlet tongue.

The night was its disguise.

The little girl was still concentrating on trimming her nails. Her snow-white skirt fell to her ankles and her white socks were wrapped tightly around her slender calves.

After a short pause, the dark green snake started to climb up.

The little girl suddenly felt a chill on her calf, as if something was wriggling gently on it.

She looked down and immediately let out a scream. She suddenly jumped up from the ground and cried out as she jumped. Her face was pale and terrified\!

"Whoosh\!"

When she let out a cry, Catherine, who was lying in the grass not far away in a daze, had already jumped up and instantly rushed in front of her. She swung her claws and sent the small snake flying\!

Then, she jumped up with the small snake. With a silver flash, the small snake was cut in half and fell into the grass, twisting its body in pain.

The little girl was still jumping and screaming, as if she could not stop.

The pride that was lying in the grass to rest got up in fright and looked over.

Chu Xiaoye had already jumped down from the tree and looked at the little snake that Catherine had killed. His gaze was a little grave. He immediately walked to the little girl's side, raised his upper body, and placed his two claws on the little girl's shoulders. He used a little strength and the little girl sat on the ground with a bang.

At this moment, the little girl stopped screaming and widened her eyes, looking at him with tears in her eyes.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his claws and landed on the ground, looking down at her right leg.

There were two teeth marks on her slender calf and a few drops of blood were flowing out, dying her white socks red.

Chu Xiaoye immediately extended his claws and skillfully pulled off her knee-length socks, revealing the wound that had been bitten by the little snake.

On her snow-white and tender skin, the two teeth marks with blood were very striking. The surroundings of the wound had already turned black.

It was a viper\!

Furthermore, the poison might be very strong.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate and immediately instructed Catherine beside him to press her claws on the little girl's thigh to stop the venom from flowing up. Then, he lowered his head and started to use his teeth to press around the wound, as if he had once healed Mei Mei, to let the poisoned blood bleed out.

However, the effect was not too good.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the wound and then looked up at the little girl who was looking at him pitifully with tears in her eyes. He hesitated for a few seconds before suddenly lowering his head and sucking the wound hard. At the same time, he smeared it with his saliva.

The little girl frowned and bit her lips, not making a sound. Her blue eyes were filled with tears as she looked at him in a daze.

Beside him, Catherine also looked at him in a daze.

Moonlight flowed quietly like water.
