Chapter 297: The King's fart

After dawn.

The lion was still lying on the grass, but it was no longer moving and had become a dry corpse.

Every animal had to experience life and death.

Therefore, no one bothered about his disappearance.

Until the next night, two more lions patrolling the territory fell to the ground and turned into two dried corpses.

The pride near the forest was in chaos and terrified.

Because they did not know what enemy killed these three lions. They died silently and miserably, with almost no wounds visible.

This matter quickly alarmed Lars, One-eyed, and the others.

They checked one by one, but they could not find any clues. Hence, they strengthened the patrol strength of this territory.

One-eyed personally brought the lions to patrol the vicinity.

However, on the third night, another group of female lions that had gone out to hunt fell to the ground. Their deaths were the same as the previous three lions. Their eyes were wide open and their bodies dried up, turning them into dried corpses.

There were no wounds on her body and did not seem to be any alarms. The five female lions died here silently.

What kind of enemy was so cruel and terrifying?

At this moment.

Chu Xiaoye had already marked the territory of the cold father's pride and was preparing to patrol the next territory.

One-eyed did not dare to hide anything and came to inform him personally.

When Chu Xiaoye heard the news, he immediately rushed to the scene with Catherine and Tilly.

When he saw the few withered corpses, his heart trembled. He immediately thought of the group of mosquitoes he had encountered when he went to the mountain to pick honey that day.

At that time, the state of death of the five black bears was identical to that of these corpses.

Obviously, the enemy was either other carnivores or those terrifying mosquitoes\!

Tilly crawled under him again and lay on the ground, trembling. Clearly, she also knew who the murderer was.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the dried corpses on the ground with a grave expression.

They could see that the powerful black lions could be guarded against, attacked, and fought. However, as for those terrifying mosquitoes, no matter how strong and united they were, it seemed to be useless.

What should he do?

For the first time, Chu Xiaoye felt helpless and hopeless.

Looking at the remaining members who were panicking and uneasy standing not far away, no matter how helpless he was, as a king, he had to do something to comfort them and calm them down.

He decided to stay here tonight and patrol personally.

Mosquitoes were afraid of smoke.

He did not have smoke from the fire, but he had farts.

Tonight, he decided to take a risk and see if his black smoke could defeat those terrifying giant mosquitoes\!

If even he could not defeat those mosquitoes, this team could only migrate for the time being.

He believed that in nature, any animal had a natural enemy.

Even after that mutation and the change in the order of the biological chain, the rule of one thing subduing another still existed.

However, the nemesis of some creatures had yet to appear.

Chu Xiaoye stayed in this dangerous territory.

Catherine was still like his shadow, following closely behind him.

The female cub knew that his decision was even at the risk of death, but she did not hesitate at all.

It was just for a group of subordinates that he did not know.

How could she not admire and be fascinated by such a king?

She did not agree with his actions, but she followed behind him without hesitation and prepared to use her life to resist any harm for him.

One-eyed admired and was impressed by Chu Xiaoye's decision. He also stayed behind with his guards.

The pride of this territory finally relaxed and were even more respectful and grateful to this young king.

After dark.

Chu Xiaoye instructed the members of the pride to return to the bushes and rest together. They were not to run around.

He brought Catherine to patrol the border of the forest.

One-eyed brought his guards and patrolled outside the bushes, preparing to deal with any sudden situation.

At midnight, the territory was still very calm. Nothing happened.

Chu Xiaoye was bored and decided to continue marking the border.

Catherine followed closely behind him. Every time he marked the territory with urine, her heart would race. She lowered her head and peeked at him.

When the sky was about to brighten.

Chu Xiaoye left his scent at the border of the forest.

Just as he was about to continue marking the border, One-eyed's furious roar suddenly came from outside the bushes not far away.

Then, the roars of the other lions sounded one after another.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. With a whoosh, he immediately ran over with Catherine.

When he came close, he suddenly saw the corpse of a lion lying on the ground.

This lion was One-eyed's guard. It was originally extremely strong, but now, it had become a withered corpse.

At this moment, One-eyed was escaping into the bushes with the other guards. As he ran, he jumped and fought, letting out angry and terrified roars.

Behind them and above them was a black mass of figures that were emitting ear-splitting buzzing sounds. It was the terrifying giant mosquitoes\!

Dressed in armor, the powerful One-eyed was in a sorry state. He was chased away and his claws and sharp teeth had become useless.

As for the lions hiding in the bushes, they fled in panic.

A group of grassland beasts were running in fear from a group of mosquitoes and could not resist at all\!

A few lions had already fallen to the ground and were rolling around with miserable cries. In the blink of an eye, they became dried corpses.

Seeing this scene, the other members were even more shocked.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and rushed over.

This roar immediately made the lions change directions and run towards him, their faces filled with panic.

The lion brought the lionesses and the lionesses brought the cubs. They were extremely terrified and treated him as their only hope. They ran towards him with all their might.

One-eyed also turned around and ran over with the few guards.

This always calm lion king was as terrified and helpless as the other members. He treated him as his only hope.

The black mass of mosquitoes immediately changed directions and charged over with a murderous aura.

Chu Xiaoye curled his tail and rushed up without hesitation\!

Catherine followed closely behind him, her dark eyes bright and determined. She also did not hesitate and was not afraid of death\!

As long as she could be with him, it was worth it even if she died\!

She roared angrily, jumped up, and rushed in front of him. She took the lead to pounce on the group of terrifying killers, wanting to attract all the harm for her\!

"Pfft—"

At the same time, just as she jumped into the air, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and suddenly sprayed out black smoke from behind. It happened to spray on her body and instantly covered her entire body\!
