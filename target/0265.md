Chapter 265: Calamity

"Whoosh\!"

Just as Little Curly Tail pounced over, a huge crocodile about five meters long suddenly jumped out of the water. It opened its bloody mouth full of fangs and bit at him\!

This huge body and ferocious aura immediately frightened Little Curly Tail.

Seeing that he was about to pounce into the huge crocodile's bloody mouth, the tail behind him suddenly swung in the water. His body immediately changed directions and he actually turned around to run.

In the water, he was no match for these giant killers.

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and told everyone to go ashore quickly.

Now, these crocodiles had become exceptionally huge and ferocious.

If there were only one or two of them, they could still try to kill them. However, there were still many following behind this crocodile. Perhaps there were more hiding underwater. He did not dare to underestimate these water killers.

Everyone immediately ran ashore.

Chu Xiaoye originally thought that these underwater killers would stop here. Unexpectedly, these big fellows actually shook their heads and wagged their tails. They climbed ashore and opened their mouths to charge at them ferociously.

Indeed, after that mutation, many animals were already too confident.

In the water, Chu Xiaoye might give in to them. After all, they were the overlords of the water; but now that they were on the shore, he would not choose to tolerate them anymore.

Otherwise, wouldn't he lose his reputation as the king of the grassland?

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and pounced forward first.

Catherine, Tilly, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the six lions pounced on them.

Even Lars and the cold father charged forward.

The female lions that had yet to recover roared and cheered from behind.

Molly also followed behind Mei Mei and charged forward bravely.

The five giant crocodiles that had just climbed out of the water immediately suffered the most ferocious, most united, and most fatal attack\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw cut off the upper jaw of a crocodile\!

Tilly's golden claw cut off the crocodile's two eyes and half of its head\!

As for Catherine's silver claws, she opened their stomachs when the two crocodiles rolled violently in pain\!

Little Curly Tail's tail wrapped around the mouth of a crocodile. Then, he suddenly exerted strength and dragged the crocodile, which was nearly 600 kilograms, into the encirclement of the mixed fur and the other six lions. It was beaten by the cruelest group and died on the spot\!

Mei Mei agilely jumped onto the back of a crocodile and cut open the back of the crocodile with her light blue claws\!

When the crocodile turned its head and was about to bite her, Molly immediately rushed up and bit the crocodile's front leg. She swung her head and actually bit off the front leg.

The cold father took the opportunity to pounce on it and bite the crocodile's neck\!

Although he had lost a fang, the remaining teeth were still sharp\!

In a moment.

The five overly confident water overlords lay on the shore and did not move again.

The other crocodiles watching in the water immediately fled in panic.

Chu Xiaoye tore open the thick leather armor on a crocodile and lowered his head to take a bite of the fresh crocodile meat. It was not too delicious, but he could still swallow it.

This was not the time to be picky.

Everyone immediately started eating.

After eating and drinking their fill, everyone continued on their way.

At this moment, the sun had already set.

Night fell.

A bright moon rose on the grassland.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team up the hill.

A strong smell of blood suddenly blew in the air.

On the grass in front of him lay the corpse of a lion.

Not far away, the corpses of female lions and young cubs appeared one after another.

In the distance, the roar of a lion could be heard.

In the darkness, many dark and cold eyes lit up.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and brought the team forward.

The massacre of the black lions continued. Every night was a bloody moment.

The countless lions, female lions, and young cubs on this grassland were trembling in this dark massacre, terrified and in despair. Some ran for their lives, while others died in battle.

Chu Xiaoye could not save them one by one.

He also had his pride to protect.

If the pride on this grassland wanted to live and continue to stay in their home, they could only unite and chase away the black killers.

However, for animals, it was easier said than done to unite and face the outside world.

Even humans could not do it, let alone animals.

The world is undergoing a drastic change.

The biological chains of nature were reshuffling.

The fittest survived, and the weak were eliminated.

He could not change anything.

"Roar—"

Just as they walked a few kilometers away, the roar of a lion suddenly came from the grassland in front of them again.

Then, a black mass of black lions chased after a pride and quickly ran over.

In this pride, only a lion, three female lions, and two young cubs were left.

They panicked and did not know where to flee to. They could only run for their lives towards the river, terrified and in despair.

When they came in front of Chu Xiaoye's team, they immediately stopped in their tracks and looked at this pride that seemed to be even stronger in fear.

When the black lions caught up to them, they immediately stopped and looked at Chu Xiaoye's team in bewilderment.

"Roar—"

At this moment, a strong black lion walked out of the crowd and looked warningly at Chu Xiaoye's team, telling them not to be nosy.

Obviously, he knew that this team was not to be trifled with.

Furthermore, looking at the tall bodies of the six lions, they were clearly not species on this grassland. Therefore, he did not want to provoke them, as long as they left sensibly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the pride that was running for their lives and then at the ten-over black lions. Just as he was about to leave with the team, the black lion leader suddenly roared angrily and looked at the cold father, Aisha, and the other female lions.

He bared his fangs and revealed a fierce expression, signaling that the other members could leave. However, the cold father and the few female lions had to stay\!

After the confrontation just now, he saw that this pride did not seem to have any courage, so he immediately became even more arrogant.

However, he probably never would have thought that his last request would bring disaster to him and his companions\!

"Whoosh\!"

After he expressed this meaning, his figure flashed and a golden light suddenly flashed in front of him\!

Then, his entire head actually split into two\!

"Bam\!"

He fell to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of him, raised his foot, and stepped on half of his face, trampling his face into the mud.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

More figures rushed up\!

Cold light flashed and blood splashed\!

Miserable cries immediately came from the black pride.
