Chapter 212: Winner

The roars continued.

The battle between the pride and the hyenas was still intense.

Chu Xiaoye brought the two warthogs to the cave where the sea python was hiding. Then, he circled around the entrance and came to the top of the cave.

The entrance and sides of the cave were made of hard rocks.

However, the top of the hole was thick mud.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye planned to let the two warthogs use their digging skills to attack from above.

He and Catherine guarded outside the cave.

As long as a sea python ran out, they could kill it directly.

If those sea pythons were unwilling to come out, he would let the warthog continue to dig until the cave collapsed and buried them.

At that time, they would be turtles in a jar\!

The two warthogs had already been terrified by him. After hearing his orders, they immediately started digging.

Because the ground was damp and the soil was soft, this work was very easy for them.

Before long, they dug a huge pit at the top of the cave.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine guarded both sides of the cave.

Blue stood behind the two warthogs to prevent the sea pythons from escaping.

Soon, the two warthogs dug through the top of the hole. The soil rustled down the hole and the sea python hiding in the hole finally panicked.

A sea python immediately raised its head and opened its mouth, jumping out of the cave.

Just as it left the hole, Catherine, who was beside it, suddenly slashed down with her claws and cut its head off\!

The headless corpse fell into the hole and vomited blood as it rolled violently.

The other sea pythons following behind the sea python immediately retreated into the cave when they saw this scene.

The two warthogs continued to dig.

The damp soil started to fall piece by piece into the hole and hit the sea pythons.

"Whoosh\!"

Two more sea pythons rushed out of the cave in panic\!

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine attacked together and instantly cut off their heads.

The other sea pythons were terrified and started to climb towards the top of the hole. Their mouths were wide open as they crawled out of the hole dug by the two warthogs.

The two warthogs immediately took a few steps back and quickly dug the soil from the ground, scattering it towards the sea pythons.

Just as a sea python was about to climb out of the cave, Blue rushed over like lightning and bit the sea python's head. With a crack, he bit its head off.

The other sea pythons immediately shrank their heads in fear.

The two warthogs hurriedly walked forward and started to dig the ground.

The soil fluttered and in a while, it was everywhere in the hole.

The dozen or so sea pythons hiding inside knew that if this continued, they would only be buried alive. Hence, they could only muster their courage and charge out of the cave together\!

They raised their heads, opened their mouths, and bared their sharp fangs. They let out fierce hissing sounds and tried to scare the two killers outside the cave.

However, just as they rushed out of the hole, two figures suddenly jumped out from behind the rocks on the left and right. With a whoosh, two heads were cut off\!

Before they could react, the two figures swung their claws and started a bloody massacre\!

At the same time, a figure jumped down from the top of the hole and landed in the middle of them. It opened its mouth and let out cracking sounds.

In the blink of an eye, only three out of ten sea pythons were left\!

The three sea pythons were terrified. They hurriedly turned around and fled into the cave again.

But at this moment, they could not escape\!

"Boom\!"

The ceiling suddenly collapsed\!

A large amount of soil fell and buried them\!

The two strong warthogs accidentally fell and hit them heavily.

The three sea pythons immediately felt extreme pain from being smashed. They twisted their bodies violently under the soil, wanting to stick their heads out.

The two warthogs were afraid of being bitten by it. They hurriedly lowered their heads and stabbed the two sharp fangs at the corner of their mouths into the soil, right on their heads\!

The two sea pythons died on the spot.

The other sea python's mouth was suddenly filled with mud because it wanted to open its mouth to bite. Its head was also pressed by two warthogs and it could not move. Before long, it suffocated to death.

However, the two warthogs did not stop attacking. They still lowered their heads and crazily used the two fangs at the corner of their mouths to stab the soil\!

Soon, the soil was dyed red with blood and their two snow-white fangs turned bright red.

At this moment.

The mixed fur lion king was still leading the pride and fighting the hyenas.

Both sides had suffered casualties, so they had already lost their minds and seemed to want to fight to the death.

Although the mixed fur lion king was strong, it was still injured.

After all, there were too many enemies, and the hyena queen was very strong. Her claws had evolved to be extremely sharp. This was something he had never expected.

Out of the three female lions, two were bitten to death, and the last one was squatting on the ground. It could only bare its teeth and roar, unable to fight anymore.

As for the three lions, although they were alive, they were riddled with wounds and exhausted. They no longer had their previous courage and ferocity. They could only lean on each other and continue fighting.

The hyena queen was not injured, but more than half of her hyenas were dead or injured.

Most of them were bitten to death by the mixed fur lion king.

The hyenas were terrified by the hyena king's strength, but under the hyena queen's roar, they had no choice but to continue mustering their courage to attack.

Chu Xiaoye saw that they were inseparable and knew that if this continued, no one would be able to complete the mission this time.

He immediately picked up the corpse of a sea python from the ground and turned around. He looked at Catherine and Blue, then at the two warthogs. Then, he walked towards the two sides that were fighting crazily.

At this moment.

The hyena queen, who was circling the mixed fur lion king and preparing to take the opportunity to scratch it, suddenly stopped in place and looked at them in shock.

The other hyenas immediately stopped running and looked over.

The mixed fur lion king was baring its teeth and roaring. Seeing this strange scene, it turned its head and looked behind. The roar in its mouth immediately stopped.

Chu Xiaoye brought a sea python close and placed it on the grass.

Catherine and Blue also placed the headless corpse of a sea python on the ground.

Even the two warthogs walked over proudly with a bloody sea python corpse in their mouths.

At this moment, the pride and hyenas that were fighting intensely and biting with all their might froze in place, as if they were petrified.

They fought with their lives and paid such a huge price for the sea python in the cave.

Now, more than half of their companions were dead and injured. They were also riddled with wounds and the victor had yet to be decided. However, those sea pythons and their merits had already been snatched away\!

Two lions, a leopard, and two pigs\!

These despicable and shameless bastards took advantage of the situation and benefited from it\!
