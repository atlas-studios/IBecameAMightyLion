Chapter 164: Cold and Vicious

"Roar\!"

After a short silence, the other four female lions immediately bared their fangs and surrounded them, roaring angrily.

However, other than the female lion that was about to deal with Doya who continued forward, the other three female lions all stopped a few meters away at the same time.

Their roars were trembling and their eyes were filled with fear.

Because they had just seen the little lion's speed and strength, but no one could react.

It was too fast and fierce\!

As for the lioness who was about to use her claws to grab Doya, she did not see it.

Therefore, she immediately roared and pounced forward, preparing to save her sister.

However, she did not know that her sister had already stopped breathing.

Chu Xiaoye loosened his teeth. When she pounced ferociously, he suddenly slapped her head and sent her flying with a bang\!

Before she could land, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed up, jumped up, and bit her throat, landing on the ground with her\!

"Crack\!"

He was merciless and did not have any protective feelings for the fairer sex. He pierced her throat\!

Savage and ruthless\!

When the remaining three female lions saw this terrifying scene, they did not dare to stay any longer. They hurriedly turned around and fled in fear.

The rain was still falling.

They stepped on the flying mud and ran all the way. They no longer cared about their clean fur and pride as they left the bushes in a hurry and ran towards the distant grassland.

The lioness whose throat was bitten by Chu Xiaoye struggled in fear and helplessness for a few times before her body turned limp like her sisters and she died completely\!

Chu Xiaoye still bit her throat tightly and let the rain fall on him and his head. His vision was blurred.

He had to be cold and heartless\!

If he wanted to survive here and occupy his territory, he had to learn to be a true lion\!

Any soft-heartedness or mercy was fatal\!

Because your opponent will never show mercy to you\!

He was just hiding here for a while and resting. He was chased away by the female lions like they were treating beggars and tramps. They even wanted to bully a shivering cub.

Since they did not have a benevolent heart, why should he be benevolent to them?

There was no mercy in the world of animals\!

For the sake of his territory, home, survival, and future Little Curly Tail and the others, he had to have the coldness and ruthlessness a lion should have\!

He would not show mercy to anyone who blocked his path\!

The path of a lion king would definitely be filled with blood\!

The Chino brothers stood to the side and looked at him in fear and shame.

Doya walked to his side and crawled on the ground to express her gratitude and submission.

The jackals' eyes were filled with hope.

Although this beautiful grassland was full of powerful enemies, as long as he was here, they had hope.

They would definitely be able to plant their roots in this grassland and work hard to survive\!

Tonight was a new beginning.

The corpses of the two female lions lay miserably in the rain.

No one knew if they had already realized before their deaths that this foreign little lion would become the greatest threat to their super pride\!

This was a rich and luxurious land.

There was water, grass, trees, bushes, and many herbivores.

Here, no one would worry about being hungry.

The only threat they faced was some powerful wandering lion alliances.

Their territory was very big.

This forest was only a small part of it.

Therefore, their pride was divided into a few teams and each occupied an area to live in.

They would only gather together when needed.

However, they probably never would have thought that a strange foreign team would trespass their territory and kill their two companions mercilessly.

Furthermore, the one who cruelly killed their companions was not an adult lion or any other powerful animal, but a young male cub that had just turned a year old.

Presumably, if that powerful lion king learned of this news, it would definitely be furious and personally bring the team to take revenge.

This was the effect Chu Xiaoye wanted to achieve.

He had to see clearly how strong the pride that occupied this territory was.

Then, he would make plans.

If the other party was not strong enough, he would defeat the lion king and occupy the entire pride and territory.

If the other party was strong or very united, he would find an opportunity to defeat them one by one, kill them, or conquer them\!

As for giving up, it was impossible\!

How could he give up the place that the future king of the grassland wanted?

Even if it had three heads and six arms, he was not afraid\!

The rain stopped at midnight.

Chu Xiaoye did not sleep. Instead, he stood outside the bushes and looked at the distant grassland.

Under the wash of the rain, the entire grassland was even greener and more beautiful. It grew strong and even at night, herbivores were eating greedily.

Compared to the territory of the cold father's pride, it was like a dream.

When that day came, he would conquer this pride and successfully own this territory. When he returned to pick them up, they would probably be more excited than him when they saw this fairyland-like territory. They would be so excited that they would not be able to sleep.

This was heaven.

When the sky was about to brighten, the three female lions still did not return with reinforcements.

It seemed that their territory was a little ridiculous.

Chu Xiaoye's jealous stomach growled.

He was hungry.

His appetite had increased recently and his body was becoming stronger.

His growth speed seemed to have increased.

This was a good thing.

At this time, he could not starve.

He looked back at Doya, who was resting. He turned around and walked deeper into the bushes.

There should be many prey there.

The sudden rain last night had knocked down many leaves and fruits.

The forest was indeed very lively.

Black antelopes, gazelles, warthogs, rabbits, squirrels, and other small animals could be found everywhere.

The grass was dense and was very good for hiding.

However, the wet ground was not beneficial for running close.

Chu Xiaoye observed for a while, hid in a lush bush, and waited patiently.

Soon, a warthog walked over with a grunt.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it and suddenly thought of the warthog at home. It was a very smart pig and had given them a lot of help.

He did not like to eat warthog. The moment he saw the warthog, he thought of the warthog on the Baobab tree. He was tired of it.

He was still hiding in the grass and did not move.

However, the warthog was stupid. It actually chewed its food and pushed open the bushes to walk in.

Then, it instantly froze there.

When it and Chu Xiaoye stared at each other and the air was silent, the little animals outside suddenly let out cries and fled in panic\!

A figure covered in patterns suddenly jumped down from a nearby tree and pounced on a gazelle that was lowering its head to eat grass. Then, it picked up the gazelle and quickly disappeared into the grass in the distance.

When Chu Xiaoye heard the noise and looked up, he only saw its slender tail full of patterns swinging in the grass and quickly leaving.
