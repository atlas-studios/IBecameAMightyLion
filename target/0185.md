Chapter 185: Starting to Evolve

"Hom\! Hom\! Hom\!"

The zebras were in chaos.

Catherine ignored the three murderous lions and rushed into the zebra herd. She pounced on a zebra and pierced its throat with her sharp teeth\!

The zebra still stood tenaciously, shaking its neck and struggling.

Catherine knelt on her hind legs and pierced her two sharp claws into its head. She suddenly swung her neck and actually pushed it to the ground.

Then, before it died completely, she dragged it and prepared to return.

The three tall and mighty lions had just run over with a murderous aura when they saw this scene.

A female cub that had yet to become an adult easily dragged a zebra that weighed more than 300 kilograms and moved quickly, looking skillful\!

They widened their eyes and turned to look at the female lions that followed.

Were none of the twelve adult female lions a match for her?

She even cut open two of them and injured a few\!

This female cub actually had such terrifying strength\!

Even on the entire grassland, it was rare.

If this was a lion, they would not hesitate to kill it\!

However, this was a female lion.

At this moment, every pride was trying their best to strengthen themselves. If they could bring this powerful female cub into the pride and increase the strength of the pride, their king would definitely be overjoyed.

Furthermore, although this female cub looked small, she would become an adult in a few years.

At that time, they could use her powerful genes to make her pregnant with their offspring and give birth to an even stronger cub\!

At the thought of this, the three lions looked at each other and immediately put away their fangs in tacit understanding.

"Roar—"

They raised their necks and let out roars filled with male dignity and aura. They circled the female cub and calmly expressed their intentions.

"As long as you join our pride, we will let bygones be bygones\! Furthermore, from today onwards, you will have a fertile territory and the safest guardian\!"

The three lions raised their heads and stuck out their chests. As they displayed their strength, they looked at her with anticipation.

Catherine's answer was very simple.

"Whoosh\!"

She put down the zebra and rushed over. She swung her sharp claws and mercilessly scratched the face of a lion\!

Fast\! Ruthless\! Accurate\!

The lion was completely unguarded. Just as it saw a figure flash in front of it, before it could react, it suddenly felt an intense pain on its face\!

Then, blood flowed. Half of his face and entire nose were torn off by the sharp claws\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly let out a painful roar and fell to the ground. He covered his face with his claws and cried out miserably as he rolled around with all his might\!

This sudden attack immediately stunned the other two lions and the other lionesses\!

This female cub was actually so daring and cruel\!

They had already let bygones be bygones and were preparing to accept her into the pride. Not only was she not grateful, she actually suddenly attacked\!

Others would kill her without a word, but she did not even let out a fart or express anything before attacking\!

They had never seen such a ferocious, violent, and terrifying lioness\!

"Roar—"

The other two lions were shocked and furious when they saw this scene. Their eyes immediately spewed flames and they roared\!

Catherine's gaze turned cold. She did not retreat\!

She had caught the previous one off guard and injured it. Now, the two of them were on guard. Their size and strength could not be underestimated.

She had to rely on her speed to dodge their killer move first before she could take the opportunity to counterattack.

The lion whose face and nose had been grabbed was still roaring in pain on the ground, scaring the distant herbivores into fleeing in panic.

Seeing their companion's miserable appearance, the two lions no longer had any protective feelings for the fairer sex. They bared their fangs and prepared to pounce on and bite.

Right at this moment, a roar suddenly sounded from the distant grassland\!

Then, a figure rushed over\!

On the green grassland, that extraordinary golden fur fluttered in the morning wind. It was like a ray of sunlight that stayed on his neck, beautiful and dazzling\!

Catherine looked at him in a daze. The cold killing intent in her eyes suddenly melted and disappeared.

As for the two lions, they were furious.

Perhaps they could accept female lions crossing realms and trespassing their territory, but they could not tolerate male lions\!

"Roar—"

They immediately roared angrily, turned around, and ran over\!

Their roars were filled with the deterrence of a lion. Their thick mane fluttered even more under the sun\!

Those who trespassed would die\!

They pounced forward aggressively\!

"Whoosh\!"

Just as the two sides were about to approach, the figure suddenly jumped up and landed behind them. Then, it turned around and clawed, leaving a bloody wound on their butts\!

The two lions were shocked and furious. They hurriedly turned around, bared their fangs, and pounced and bit.

Chu Xiaoye put away his sharp golden claws, raised his palms, and swung them ferociously from left to right\!

"Bang\! Bang\!"

The two lions tilted their heads and their huge and heavy bodies actually staggered to the side. They fell to the ground and bit mouthfuls of mud\!

The two lions crawled on the ground. For a moment, they were dizzy and their ears were buzzing. Their minds were blank.

Chu Xiaoye raised his right claw. With a whoosh, a few sharp golden claws popped out like springs. They flickered with a dazzling light under the sun.

His claws grew longer and he became taller. Even the golden fur on his neck grew longer than his other fur.

After resting for only four hours, the wounds on his body that had been bitten by the hyenas actually healed quickly and he no longer felt any pain.

He felt that his current strength was surging and extremely strong.

Against these two tall and strong lions, even if he did not use his claws, he could easily slap them to the ground and make them unable to get up.

Furthermore, he had not used his full strength just now.

He was certain that he had evolved after the battle last night.

Furthermore, the speed of evolution did not seem to have stopped and was still increasing.

Around the golden fur on his neck, he started to shed his fur.

Clearly, he was not middle-aged and bald. Instead, he was preparing to grow new fur.

It seemed that the strange heat in his body had already modified his body and started to modify his appearance and weapons.

His golden claws were sharper and more agile\!

Of course, he would definitely be even more handsome\!

Otherwise, why would the female lions freeze in place and look at him with burning eyes?

However, he did not like aunties\!

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and officially announced to them that the territory next door was his\!

He, Chu Xiaoye, was the king there\!

In the future, if anyone dared to covet his territory or his lionesses, he would not be polite\!

Catherine dragged the zebra and walked over quickly, her narrowed eyes filled with admiration.

The female lions froze in place and did not dare to stop him.

As for the two lions that had already woken up, they were still crawling on the ground and did not dare to get up.

They could do nothing about this brazen act of stealing and beating their owner, and could only choose to ignore it.

"Two despicable thieves\!"
