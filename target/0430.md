Chapter 430: Untitled

Alisa had a dream.

In her dream, she finally got her wish and became a queen who looked down on the world.

However, when she returned to the camp in high spirits with her head raised proudly, she suddenly twisted her butt and wagged her tail. She took the initiative to lie on the ground obediently and was ridden by a lion covered in golden fur, being bullied wantonly.

Alisa was trembling with anger from her dream and almost broke down.

She suddenly roared angrily and pounced at her lying on the ground, wagging her tail and begging for mercy with a fawning expression.

She wanted to bite her fallen self to death\!

The morning sun was cut into mottled light by the dense leaves and swayed on Alisa's embarrassed and distorted face.

She slowly opened her eyes and realized that the experience just now was just a nightmare.

However, the experience last night was still vivid in her mind.

She could not forget that fellow's wretched and despicable face last night\!

Suddenly, Alisa seemed to have thought of something\!

She suddenly jumped up from the ground and looked around, but did not see that damn face. She was stunned and turned to look behind her. She could not see or feel anything.

It was over, it seemed to be over…

That pervert had already wanted her so brazenly when she was awake. After she fainted, he would definitely not let her go. Absolutely.

She never would have thought that she would covet his dazzling throne and that he would covet her beautiful body.

It was over. Everything was over.

She, Alisa, had lost her virginity before she could become a queen.

If she was pregnant with that bastard's child again in the future, she…

Was her dream of being a queen going to disappear from now on?

Damn it\!

She wanted to kill that despicable, shameless, dirty, and ugly pervert\!

Suddenly, she turned around and looked at the figure that was slowly walking over. She gritted her teeth and trembled.

When enemies come face to face, their eyes blaze with hatred\!

The hatred of snatching her body was irreconcilable\!

Die\! Perverted lion\!

"If I said that after knocking you out last night, I did not do anything to you and even helped you tidy your messy fur very gently, would you believe me?"

Chu Xiaoye expressed his intentions sincerely.

He swore to God that he really did not do anything last night. It was not that he did not have the courage, but after this female cub fainted, he could not do it without her cooperating.

The loving behavior of animals, especially lions, was definitely not for enjoyment, because the process would not be enjoyable. Instead, it would be painful.

They only wanted to reproduce, strengthen their tribe, and inherit their genes. Their goal was really very simple.

Therefore, when this female cub fainted, Chu Xiaoye immediately gave up. This was because even if he succeeded, it would be meaningless and could not make him a true lion.

Furthermore, he, Chu Xiaoye, was not a baddie who took advantage of a lion's danger.

Although he wished that this lioness would die, this revenge clearly did not match his image as a handsome and righteous lion king.

He did not care\!

"I don't believe it\!"

Of course, Alisa would not believe this bastard's lie\!

Because she was very confident in her body and would never forget the wretched face that this bastard had revealed previously\!

"I'm going to kill you, bastard\!"

Alisa bared her fangs, her face distorted from embarrassment and her entire body trembling.

Chu Xiaoye loved to see his enemy flustered and exasperated. Therefore, he did not explain further. Instead, he opened his mouth and revealed a frivolous and mocking expression. "Alright, if you don't believe me, then don't believe me. However, you can't kill me because you might be pregnant with my child. When a lioness has a child but doesn't have a father's protection, you should know the consequences without me saying, right? No matter how powerful you are, it's useless. You can only protect yourself."

Alisa's fur stood on end and her entire body trembled. She was almost furious.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly pleased. He wanted to say elegantly, "Sorry for scaring you."

However, in order to slowly torture and humiliate this fellow who almost broke his balls, he decided to give her some buffer time.

"You can leave the pride and I can spare your life. Let's forget what happened previously."

After Chu Xiaoye left this sentence, he turned around and left, but he snorted coldly in his heart. Wrap it off? Don't even think about it\! The grudge between them was irreconcilable\!

Unexpectedly, the furious Alisa did not turn around and leave. Instead, she gritted her teeth and followed behind him.

"You want to chase me away after bullying me? Dream on\!"

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and continued forward, crossing the mountains. He seemed to have forgotten what happened last night.

Alisa followed behind, thinking about the terrifying scene last night. That wretched and despicable face left a lingering shadow in her heart.

Now, facing that fellow, she, who had always been fearless, actually started to feel fear.

She hated her change.

If it were in the past, she would have definitely pounced on him and torn that pervert to pieces just now\!

What should he do?

Could she be threatened by him forever?

No\!

After a while, when she realized that she was not pregnant with that bastard's child, it would be his death\!

However, what if… she got pregnant?

Pui\! Pui\! Pui\!

Impossible\!

Alisa felt that she should be more optimistic.

According to her knowledge, the chances of a lioness becoming pregnant were very low. Therefore, when a lion mated with a lioness, he would do so more than 50 times a day, or even more than 100 times. Furthermore, they would be intimate for many days continuously in order to increase the chances of pregnancy.

Last night, it had only been a few hours. She did not believe that that pervert could last hundreds of times, let alone be so coincidental that she became pregnant in one night.

Impossible\!

At the thought of this, Alisa felt a little better.

It did not take long. She would know the outcome in a few days.

At that time… Hmph\!

Just wait\!

Chu Xiaoye felt that something was wrong.

As he walked, he felt that his mouth was a little numb and his strength was exhausted very quickly. Before long, he felt a little tired.

He remembered that he had been bitten by the lioness last night and it happened to bite his mouth. He even saw blood.

Could it be that the lioness's teeth were poisonous?

It should not be.

His body would not be afraid of ordinary poison. His saliva was not even afraid of the venom of a cobra, so how could he not be able to withstand the poison on a female lion's teeth?

Furthermore, why were the female lions' teeth poisonous?

Chu Xiaoye looked back and happened to see the female lion's angry gaze. He was stunned and remembered the scarlet eyes when this female lion bit his mouth last night.

He suddenly had an ominous feeling.

Back then, this lioness's eyes were scarlet and her mental state and personality were completely different from now. The aura on her body was a little similar to those red-eyed monsters.

Could she be carrying a virus?

However, why were her eyes back to normal and her condition no longer abnormal? She did not look like she had been infected by a virus at all.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was secretly thinking, he suddenly felt his two front legs go limp. With a bang, he fell to the ground without warning.

"It's over. I'm really poisoned."

He was secretly shocked. He instantly felt his entire body go limp and could not use any strength. A burning pain jumped on his mouth and his body seemed to be burning.

This movement immediately frightened the entire pride.

Catherine hurriedly rushed in front of him and looked at him in panic, not knowing what was happening.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly rushed up, looking anxious and at a loss.

The other members of the pride hurriedly surrounded him, but they did not know what to do.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground, his consciousness gradually becoming blurry. The muscles on his entire body suddenly started to increase his strength quickly, and his amber eyes gradually turned red.

The mysterious heat in his body was trying its best to wash away the hot flame, but the flame did not retreat.

The two sides faced each other in his body, making him unable to move even if he felt his strength increase.

Little Curly Tail pushed his body anxiously with his head, wanting him to stand up.

Catherine suddenly looked at Alisa, who was following at the back.

Of course, she also recognized this lioness. Furthermore, she clearly remembered that this lioness's eyes were also scarlet back then.

The problem must have been because of this lioness last night\!

"Roar—"

Right at the critical moment, a roar suddenly came from the forest beside him.

Then, a tall gray wolf rushed over with a large group of gray wolves and a group of spotted hyenas with a murderous aura\!

Catherine recognized the alpha wolf at a glance.

It was the alpha wolf that Chu Xiaoye had snatched prey away from and played with\!

Not only did it chase with the wolf pack, it also colluded with the lion's archenemy, the hyenas, and brought a group of hyenas to seek revenge\!

There were more than thirty wolves and more than twenty hyenas. In total, there were more than the members of the pride.

Furthermore, be it the wolf pack or the hyenas, they would kill this pride without mercy\!

Now, Chu Xiaoye had already fallen and the pride no longer had a backbone. Seeing so many enemies charging over, even Blue Eyes and the others felt a little flustered.

However, they were not afraid at all. They immediately roared angrily and went forward.

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and immediately chased after them.

Mei Mei and Molly followed closely\!

The other members of the pride also roared and pounced forward, not giving the other party a chance to take another step.

They could not let these enemies charge in front of their king\!

Catherine guarded beside Chu Xiaoye with a cold gaze and a terrifying aura.

The little girl rode the big black bear and protected Chu Xiaoye. Her dark eyes were filled with determination that did not match her current age.

She would never allow any baddie to hurt him\!

The leopard family of four attacked from the tree. Every time they jumped down, they would accurately kill an enemy.

Belia roared and bit, her mouth full of blood. She even bit the enemy's head off their neck and vented her restlessness that was not satisfied\!

"Bite you to death\! Bite you to death\! Bite you useless males to death\!"

Those who died under her claws and sharp teeth were all males.

While the two sides were fighting intensely, a painful battle was happening in Chu Xiaoye's body.

The virus came ferociously and quickly contaminated the blood and organs in his body, especially the nerves of his brain. However, the strange heat in his body was trying its best to protect him.

The two sides fought and his body was on the battlefield.

He, who should have been unconscious or had his consciousness snatched away, still had some clarity in his mind.

He could clearly see everything happening in his body and the scene of the battle outside, but he was powerless.

At this moment, Alisa, who had been struggling for a long time, finally walked in front of him.

Catherine turned around and looked at him coldly. Her dark and deep eyes were as cold-blooded and terrifying as a venomous snake, as if she would attack at any time.

Alisa did not look at her and stopped at Chu Xiaoye. She looked at this young lion for a few seconds, then swept her gaze past his body and looked below him. The muscles at the corner of her eyes twitched and the tail behind her tightened unconsciously, as if she wanted to swing her tail over and slap the bad thing that had hurt her into pieces\!

Catherine revealed her silver claws like a loaded bullet\!

Fortunately, Alisa's gaze quickly returned to Chu Xiaoye's face and she looked into his eyes.

"Let me ask you again. What did you do to me last night?"

Alisa narrowed her eyes and expressed her intentions fiercely.

She wanted to be sure\!

This time, Chu Xiaoye blinked without hesitation and grinned.

"I've done everything I could. I became a true lion, and you became a true lioness. Furthermore, in the near future, I'll become a father and you'll become a mother."

Chu Xiaoye knew clearly that if he said that he did not do anything last night, this lioness would definitely leave him in the lurch.

He clearly remembered that this lioness had once had scarlet eyes.

Therefore, he was sure that this lioness definitely had a way to eliminate or control the virus in his body.

"Roar—"

Alisa bared her fangs and trembled violently. She was clearly on the verge of erupting.

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes and slowly opened them again. He tried his best to raise his head, looking like he was facing death calmly.

"Kill me. I'm in pain. Anyway, I won't be able to survive. Forget that I once saved your life. Forget that I let you join the pride to protect you along the way. Forget the mistakes I made to you and forget everything about me. Bite me to death and reduce my pain. I'll leave this pride to you. I'll leave our children to you…"

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes again.

If he was not wrong, when he said, "I'll leave this pride to you." The female lion in front of him clearly lit up and looked very interested.

Could it be that she sneaked into the pride for his throne?

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye felt a drop of warm liquid fall on his mouth.

He opened his eyes and saw that the lioness cub's left front leg was lying horizontally on his head. A bloody wound had appeared on its leg and blood was flowing out.

However, when the second drop of blood fell on his mouth, the wound suddenly stopped bleeding.

Chu Xiaoye was anxious.

He could already tell that the blood in this female cub's body could help him detoxify the poison\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his head with unknown strength and bit the front leg into his mouth. He started to suck the blood in the wound with all his might and swallowed greedily.

Alisa immediately froze in place, raised her left front leg, and looked at him with her eyes wide.

In order to quickly eliminate the virus in his body, Chu Xiaoye bit her thigh and sucked happily. He could not stop\!

"Bang\!"

Alisa swung her tail and slapped his crotch again\!

"Roar —"

A miserable scream suddenly sounded in the forest\!

Chu Xiaoye, who was still soft and enjoying himself a second ago, immediately straightened his body and jumped up from the ground\!
