Chapter 450: Untitled

"Pui\!"

Chu Xiaoye spat out the mud in his mouth and swayed his neck. Fortunately, his neck was not broken.

Looking at the little girl lying on the ground pretending to be unconscious, he raised his foot and stepped on her exquisite little face. Just as he was about to trample her with all his might, the big black bear immediately roared and bared its fangs, pretending to charge over.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and looked at it with a burning gaze.

He really wanted to fight this big black bear and test its true strength.

Unfortunately, this big black bear still only knew how to bluff. Under his gaze, it did not dare to take a step forward.

The little girl lying on the ground still pretended to be unconscious with her eyes closed and did not move. However, the expression on her face had already changed.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to continue trampling on it, Little Curly Tail's roar suddenly came from outside. His roar was filled with fear and panic.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and immediately ran out.

The other members of the pride hurriedly followed.

Little Curly Tail had always been bold. He even dared to provoke enemies stronger than him. Now that he had let out such a panicked roar, it seemed that he had encountered a terrifying danger.

Chu Xiaoye was very fast. After charging out of the space under the tree, he rushed towards the dense bushes in front of him.

Little Curly Tail's roar came from there.

"Whoosh\!"

When he crawled out of a bush, he saw Little Curly Tail at a glance\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail was actually hanging in midair and stuck in a huge transparent net. No matter how he struggled, it was useless\!

His iron whip-like tail was also stuck on it. It was covered in sticky things, as if it was tightly bound and had no use.

At the same time, a huge spider more than a meter long was crawling around Little Curly Tail quickly. It used new spider silk to continue winding Little Curly Tail's tail and limbs\!

The huge spider was colorful and had a pair of sharp fangs. The spider silk it pulled out was as thick as a hemp rope, but it was exceptionally tough and elastic. No matter how hard Little Curly Tail swayed, he could not escape.

Little Curly Tail let out a terrified roar again.

In front of countless deaths, he had never been so afraid. Now, facing this terrifying poisonous worm, he was afraid.

"Brother\! Save me\!"

Little Curly Tail was actually crying.

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly sounded from behind Chu Xiaoye\!

The cold father's mane fluttered as he took the lead and jumped up. He jumped up high and raised his claws, grabbing fiercely at the spider webs beside him. His eyes were filled with the dignity and dominance of a lion king\!

"Unfilial son\! Your father is here\!"

However, the spider threads only flicked hard and were not broken.

The cold father opened his limbs, opened his mouth, and stared. He was also stuck on it…

When the other members of the pride saw this scene, they stopped behind Chu Xiaoye and did not dare to attack easily.

The huge spider immediately dragged its thick and long spider silk and started to wrap around the cold father.

The cold father twisted his body with all his might and shook the entire giant spider web. Unfortunately, it was useless.

Seeing the huge spider coming at him, the cold father was also afraid. He immediately roared and shouted for help.

"Unfilial—son\! Save me\!"

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and narrowed his eyes to observe carefully. He immediately turned around to look at Catherine and Mei Mei. Then, he jumped up, but he did not jump towards the huge spider web. Instead, he jumped towards the bushes at the side.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and a few tall bushes were cut to the ground.

It was not that he did not save them immediately, but he knew that these spider threads were extraordinary.

With his previous experience, he would never underestimate anything here. The spider silk clearly had extremely terrifying mucus. Furthermore, the toughness of the spider silk was extraordinary. Otherwise, with Little Curly Tail's strength and skills, he would never have been trapped and unable to move in such a short time.

Therefore, it was impossible to cut off the spider silk in a head-on rescue.

Then, the best way was to take drastic measures and cut off the bushes supporting the spider silk around the huge spider web.

As long as the bushes fell, the huge spider web would immediately become rootless and naturally fall\!

Catherine and Mei Mei immediately accepted the order and jumped up to the bushes in the other two directions.

As the bushes Chu Xiaoye cut fell, the huge spider web started to sway violently and sway.

The huge spider that was about to inject venom into the cold father immediately started to panic and quickly crawled to the other side.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Unfortunately, the bushes on the other side also fell one after another.

The huge spider web hanging in midair finally lost its support and fell.

Little Curly Tail and the cold father fell to the ground in a sorry state.

When the spider web landed, the huge spider had already pulled the spider web and fled towards the other bushes in panic.

However, before it could escape, Alisa suddenly jumped over from the tree in front of it and cut it in half with her claws\!

"Pfft—"

Dark green juice sprayed out and landed on Alisa's face.

Alisa landed on the ground and immediately ran towards the river not far away.

She knew how terrifying this mutated venomous spider was. The venom in its body could even kill an elephant.

"Plop\!"

She jumped into the water and hurriedly buried her face in the mud at the bottom of the river to wash it.

The cold father and Little Curly Tail got up from the ground, but their bodies were covered in cobwebs. No matter how they slapped with their claws, they could not remove them. Furthermore, the mucus was almost covered in all their fur.

It was extremely uncomfortable\!

Chu Xiaoye walked close and looked at the two halves of the giant spider's corpse, then at the thick, long, and tough spider threads. He was secretly shocked.

It was indeed unbelievable that spiders could mutate to such a degree that they even dared to kill lions.

There were probably more magical and unbelievable things waiting for them in this world.

Little Curly Tail and the cold father went to the river and jumped into the river. They used the flowing river water to wash away the mucus and spider silk on their bodies.

Alisa did not know where she went. She was no longer in the river.

The sun had already set and the sky had turned dark.

Chu Xiaoye instructed the pride to rest in the cave at the bottom of the tree and not go out at night.

This was different from the grassland back then. Back then, the grassland hunted at night and rested during the day. In this unfamiliar environment, terrifying dangers were hidden everywhere. It was better to go out to hunt during the day.

The little girl had already climbed up the tree hole along the ladder and carried many soft withered grass on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye searched the surroundings but still did not find Alisa.

The female lion's face was covered in juice from the poisonous spider. Could she have been poisoned?

Chu Xiaoye walked to the river and searched again.

At this moment, the cold father and Little Curly Tail had already washed their bodies and returned to the cave at the bottom of the tree.

Chu Xiaoye searched for a while by the river but did not find any trace of the female lion. Then, he suddenly looked at the river in the night.
