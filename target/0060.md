Chapter 60: Killer in the Night

"Roar\!"

The battle between the cold father and the wandering lion was happening intensely\!

The roars of the two lions and the ferocious sounds of biting terrified the five female lions and Lars, who did not dare to go forward.

Chu Xiaoye knew that once the cold father was defeated, the entire pride would be doomed\!

This was not the time to follow the rules.

He brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei past the five female lions and walked towards the two male lions.

Although with their current bodies, they could not fight against this adult lion that was nearly 200 kilograms, they only needed to create some disturbances and the cold father's chances of winning would be much greater.

"Roar\!"

Aisha and Xi'er were frightened and hurriedly ran over to shout at them.

The battle of these two colossi was not something the three of them, who were still underage, could interfere with.

Lars's eyes were filled with ridicule.

They seemed to be saying that these three little fellows were biting off more than they could chew\!

The other lionesses were also shocked.

The lion's battle was not something they could intervene in. A random bite could take their lives.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not stop.

He walked over with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were full of fighting spirit.

"Roar\!‚Äù

Aisha and Xi'er could only roar angrily as they rushed to the front and protected them behind them.

Although they were also very afraid.

However, their great motherly love made them instantly brave and share a common enemy\!

They roared as they rushed up\!

The wandering lion was frightened and looked at them in surprise.

He hesitated for a moment, and could only stop fighting. He turned around and ran\!

His combat strength seemed to be on par with that of the cold father. The outcome was difficult to predict. However, if a lioness were to join the battle, he would definitely lose\!

He never would have thought that these female lions would not follow the rules\!

Damn it\!

Seeing that the wandering lion had turned around and fled, Aisha and Xi'er became even more confident. They roared as they continued to chase.

The cold father was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly chased after them.

He would only be at ease if the invaders were completely expelled from the territory\!

Aisha and Xi'er's actions also surprised him. However, the joy of victory made him forget these things for the time being.

He needed to use his roar and posture of a victor to warn this invader and the other wandering lions wandering at the edge of the territory. He was not to be trifled with\!

It was the lion's responsibility to chase away the invaders.

Aisha and Xi'er chased after the invader for a while before handing the task to the cold father.

They turned around and returned with mixed feelings.

He was both happy to defeat the lion invader and nervous about not following the rules.

The rules of survival and continuation of their race for thousands of years made them agree that the battle of the lion was a battle where the strong eliminated the weak, and the female lions could not interfere.

Only the victor and the strongest were qualified to stay in the pride and continue to lead the pride to survive in this cruel world.

There was no romantic relationship here, only the law of survival.

The uselessness of the lion would only drag down the continuation of the pride. A loser was not qualified to be the king of the pride\!

They would always have only one king.

That was a stronger lion\!

Therefore, at this moment, the two female lions that had broken the rules were feeling a little uneasy.

However, they did it for the children.

The instincts of a mother's love did not differentiate between right and wrong.

When they returned with complicated feelings, the other three female lions looked at them strangely.

However, the nervous and terrified atmosphere finally disappeared after the invaders retreated.

The three female lions walked in front of Aisha and Xi'er and rubbed their heads affectionately.

They did not dare to do so, but they admired their courage.

If their king was defeated, not only would the surviving cubs be killed, the unborn children in their stomachs would also be doomed.

When Aisha and Xi'er were being intimate with their sisters, they looked at the three little fellows.

They were not brave. They were clearly forced by these three little fellows who did not know their limits.

At this moment, the sun had already set.

Night fell.

The female lions brought the children back to their nest.

They did not catch any prey on the grassland during the day. They planned to take advantage of the night to hunt in the bushes at the back.

They had planned to keep this forest for the dry season when there was a lack of food. However, they had no choice but to use it in advance.

Callie and Maya were both pregnant with the hope and tomorrow of the pride. They could not let them go hungry.

The vegetation on the grassland had already dried up, and only this forest was still lush.

Many herbivores would come here to look for food.

Even during the dry season, there would be some animals staying here.

Every year in this grassland, a terrifying dry season would arrive. Therefore, some extremely drought-resistant animals would be born.

Even if the river dried up and they did not drink water for months, they could still live well.

In order to survive, they were evolving with the changes in the bad situation.

Only the fittest could survive.

These drought-resistant animals also provided food for some carnivores who were unable to leave their homes.

Aisha brought Xi'er and the lioness with a broken tail into the bushes at the back.

They tried their best to hunt at the furthest end.

Their years of survival experience told them that it was best not to use the nearest food and resources unless it was the most difficult day.

Especially when there were still cubs in the pride.

In order to survive, they could travel very far, but not the young cubs.

After the three female lions left.

Chu Xiaoye bit on the water bag and climbed up the Baobab tree.

There was only a little water left in the water bag, but it should be enough for an experiment.

When he stood on a branch and used his claws to open the wood dregs blocking the entrance of the tree hole, he suddenly realized that the small hole he had just dug was already filled with water\!

It turned out that this Baobab tree's huge water vat-like trunk had already accumulated a large amount of water resources\!

He only needed to dig out a cave and there would be an endless amount of water flowing out of the sponge-like tree trunks, automatically filling the cave\!

Looking at the thick tree trunk and the other Baobab tree beside it, Chu Xiaoye was excited.

It seemed that the water problem during the dry season had been resolved.

The water in these two Baobab trees would not be lacking even if their pride used it for two whole dry seasons.

To be careful, he decided to go to another Baobab tree and dig out a larger tree hole to see what was going on.

At this moment.

The night grew darker.

The wandering lion, which had retreated in defeat in the evening, was circling around the border of the cold father's territory and walking to the dry place downstream.

Then, he walked up along the river.

The cold father was patrolling the borders of the territory. Other than continuing to leave behind a marking smell, he was also using a low growl to warn the wandering lions nearby.

He could hear the cold father roar.

Therefore, he decided to take advantage of the absence of the cold father and go against the current, entering this territory from the river.

Then, he would ambush the pride\!

He wanted those two unruly female lions and the young cubs in the pride to pay the most terrible price\!
