Chapter 321: Desert Oasis

"Whoosh\!"

The black lion king did not retaliate. It tilted its head and dodged. Then, it suddenly jumped in front of him.

Little Curly Tail did not let up. Just as he was about to continue chasing, the black lion king suddenly used its two hind claws to dig up a few clumps of hot sand from the ground and sprinkled them behind it.

Little Curly Tail was caught off guard and was hit on the spot. He was immediately blinded and stopped, shaking his head vigorously.

Tilly passed by him and suddenly jumped towards the black lion king.

Just as he was about to pounce on the back of the black lion king, he saw the other party swing his tail and slap Tilly's head with a whoosh.

Golden light flashed\!

Tilly raised her claws and prepared to cut this tail into two\!

However, the black lion king seemed to have eyes on its back. As it ran, it quickly retracted its tail and happened to dodge her attack and pounce.

Tilly landed on the ground and continued to chase.

Chu Xiaoye realized again that no matter how they attacked, the other party only dodged and ran. Even if they occasionally counterattacked, they would never stop, as if they only wanted to escape.

With his strength, it was impossible for him to be so timid and terrified.

The sun above them started to fall west.

The temperature in the desert also reached its highest.

Both sides were thirsty and exhausted.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the hill in front of him was getting closer and closer.

However, the closer he got, the taller he felt the sand dune.

The sand dunes were connected like a continuous mountain range that extended to both sides.

The black lion king's running speed clearly slowed.

Their pursuit speed was also much slower.

No matter how much stamina he had, he could not withstand such rapid consumption.

Mixed Fur and Jerry brothers with thick manes on their necks had already fallen behind. They were panting and hot.

Tilly, who was very excited at first, also slowed down and was unwilling to run in front.

The black lion king did not give her any chance to challenge and only ran away vigorously. It was not interesting.

On the other hand, Little Curly Tail was still wagging his tail and following closely.

Soon, they started to climb up the hill.

The black lion king's speed became even slower.

They were not having a good time either. They could not jump or speed up. Occasionally, they would fall and accidentally roll down.

"Pfft—"

Chu Xiaoye sprayed air again and chased after it. He raised his golden claw and grabbed at the spine of the black lion king\!

He originally thought that this black lion king's speed had reached its limit, but unexpectedly, the other party suddenly accelerated again and immediately dodged his attack.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and suddenly had the intention to retreat.

For some reason, the higher he went, the more ominous he felt.

Obviously, this black lion king was deliberately luring them to continue chasing.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was thinking in his heart, the black lion king suddenly took the initiative to attack. Its tail suddenly swept over, bringing with it an extremely fast whistling sound\!

"Bang\!"

An explosion\!

The black lion king's tail slapped heavily on his raised claws\!

Chu Xiaoye's body suddenly trembled and the sand under his feet slipped. He was caught off guard and fell to the ground, quickly rolling down.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine suddenly leaned over and pounced on him. Her four legs pierced deeply into the sand below with a "chi" and her entire body climbed onto his body to stop him from rolling.

"Roar—"

When Little Curly Tail saw this scene, he immediately roared angrily. He swung his tail and pounced angrily.

It was his humiliation to dare to slap his brother with his tail in front of his tail\!

Just as Catherine was lying on Chu Xiaoye in a daze, a snow-white figure suddenly jumped over from the side and slapped her butt. She let out a roar and rolled her eyes.

"What time is it? You're still infatuated\! Get up\!"

Catherine's body trembled and she woke up. She hurriedly got up and moved to the side.

Chu Xiaoye got up and looked up.

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

Little Curly Tail's tail was fighting the black lion king's tail quickly. Sand flew and sparks flew. They looked to be evenly matched\!

Although the black lion king was fighting back, it still did not stop and continued to climb.

The higher they went, the more uneasy Chu Xiaoye felt.

Suddenly, he smelled a very special scent. It was damp with a fragrance and sweet.

There was water, trees, grass, and flowers\!

Why were there these things in this endless desert?

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared and told Little Curly Tail to stop chasing.

However, at this moment, Little Curly Tail was fighting excitedly. His iron whip-like tail seemed to be unable to stop as it lashed at the black lion king like a violent rain.

After blocking for a while, the black lion king was a little inferior. It could only dodge left and right and quickly climb up.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail's iron tail finally hit his back\!

Sparks flew and a tuft of black fur was sent flying.

The black lion king's body sank and its limbs almost fell into the sand.

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

Little Curly Tail chased after it and swung his iron tail crazily behind him. The shadows of his tail danced in the sky and densely covered the entire body of the black lion king.

The black lion king quickly dodged and was hit again, but it did not fall and continued to flee upwards.

Finally, he suddenly jumped up and landed on the top of the sand dune.

Just as Little Curly Tail was about to chase after him, he suddenly heard his brother roar.

He was stunned for a moment and looked back.

At this moment, the black lion king suddenly raised its hind legs and started to pee at him.

Little Curly Tail was furious. As he dodged, he swung his tail and used all his strength to charge forward.

Just as it jumped down, the black lion king suddenly seemed to have increased in strength and suddenly swung its tail\!

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail was caught off guard and his head was slapped. He staggered and rolled towards the other side of the sand dune.

The black lion king grinned and looked back at Chu Xiaoye, who was roaring as he rushed up. Then, he disappeared from the top of the sand dune.

When Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Tilly, and Mei Mei to the top of the sand dune, he was suddenly stunned by the scene in front of him.

A beautiful oasis suddenly appeared in front of him, like a paradise\!

There was grass, trees, flowers, birds, and a sparkling lake.

In front of the lake was a lush forest that was even vaster than their previous territory.

Many small animals ran and played in the bushes below.

However, they did not have the time to appreciate all of this.

Little Curly Tail had already rolled to the bottom of the sand dune. The black lion king also rushed down with its mane flying.

"Pfft—"

An explosion\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly shot out like an arrow that had been released from the bow\!
