Chapter 144: Battle by the River\!

The crocodile was too heavy.

Under normal circumstances, when leopards ate, they would drag their prey up the tree for safety.

The muscles on their front limbs and shoulders were extremely developed and could move prey that was half their weight.

However, the prey this time was too heavy.

After making sure that the crocodile was completely suffocated, it started eating on the spot.

Before eating, it raised its head and looked around vigilantly to ensure that no other carnivores were spying on it.

Chu Xiaoye crawled in the grass and decided to wait for it to eat its fill before going over.

He had observed it carefully again just now. This leopard was the same as the crocodile and was a size larger than other leopards.

The muscles on this leopard were more developed and its limbs were thicker. The fangs in its mouth were even sharper than those of ordinary leopards.

No wonder it could subdue that giant crocodile in one move\!

Its back looked so familiar.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that he did not know it.

This leopard was clearly stronger and more unpredictable.

That throat-sealing killer move was fast, accurate, strong, and ruthless, making him feel a little guilty unconsciously.

He should wait until it was full.

Just as the leopard was tearing the crocodile's armor and preparing to eat, a wave suddenly flew up from the dark river beside him\!

What followed the wave was a huge green python\!

The python's body was thick and its head was flat. From beginning to end, it was six meters long\!

It suddenly jumped onto the shore, opened its mouth, and bit at the leopard\!

The leopard was clearly frightened. It suddenly jumped up and dodged\!

The python missed and raised its upper body with a whoosh. It opened its mouth and spat out its tongue, revealing two sharp and long fangs\!

Ordinary pythons did not have fangs and only had some small teeth. They mainly relied on their bodies to kill prey and deal with enemies.

However, the python in front of him had such striking and terrifying fangs. Clearly, not only could it kill via strangulation, but it was also extremely poisonous or had a strong bite strength\!

Chu Xiaoye hid in the dense grass and looked at the three extraordinary creatures in front of him. He was a little anxious.

Clearly, the creatures here were stronger and more dangerous than those on the grassland\!

The leopard was shocked and furious when it was suddenly attacked. It immediately turned around and faced the python, baring its fangs and letting out a fierce roar\!

It did not back down at all\!

The python lowered its head and suddenly rushed over\!

The leopard immediately jumped to the side and started to use its agility to circle it.

As long as the python reacted slightly slower, it would rush up and swing its sharp claws, grabbing the python's tail fiercely\!

After a while, the python's tail was dripping with blood.

Its movements started to slow down.

The leopard took this opportunity to attack more frequently and ruthlessly\!

The python seemed to be afraid and hurriedly turned around. It dragged its bloody tail and crawled towards the river.

The leopard immediately pounced forward and bit its tail\!

Right at this moment, the python, who was trying to escape with all its might, actually turned around with an unbelievable speed and wrapped the leopard up\!

The leopard was shocked. Just as it was about to jump up, the python was even faster. It raised its head and its upper body quickly circled around it, instantly wrapping its entire body tightly in the middle\!

At this moment, the leopard seemed to have woken up from a dream and was terrified. It twisted its body with all its might, wanting to break free, but it was already too late\!

It could only open its mouth and bite the python's body\!

The python immediately dragged it and crawled towards a big tree on Chu Xiaoye's side. It quickly used the big tree to strangle it tightly, then used a terrifying killing force\!

The leopard's body was tightly pressed against the hard tree trunk\!

As for the python's thick and strong body, it continued to circle around and tighten\!

The leopard widened its terrified eyes and all the strength in its body instantly disappeared.

It could not use any more strength\!

The bones in its body started to emit cracking sounds that were about to break. The intense pain made it open its mouth, but it could not make any sound.

At this moment, the vegetation swayed with a whoosh\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stood up from the grass beside them, rushed out, and rushed to the crocodile's side.

This was the best opportunity\! 

These two powerful fellows did not have the time to care about him.

When leopards and pythons fought, lions benefited\!

The competition between animals had never been fair or unfair, and there was no such thing as despicable or shameless.

They only cared about the outcome.

Chu Xiaoye bit the giant crocodile's neck and wanted to drag it away, but he suddenly realized that this fellow was terrifyingly heavy. He could not move it at all.

He had just taken two steps and he was panting. He felt that his teeth were aching and were about to fall off.

He had no choice.

Since he could not bring it away, he could only eat it on the spot\!

Anyway, those two fellows were fighting intensely. They did not have the time to deal with him.

The leopard no longer had any strength to resist.

As for the python, it could not let go of him at this crucial moment.

Therefore, they could only watch helplessly as he ate heartily beside them.

Chu Xiaoye immediately tore open the crocodile's thick skin and started wolfing it down.

The crocodile looked ugly, but the flesh inside was exceptionally fresh. The muscles on its thigh were very tough and refreshing to chew.

The python was clearly a little embarrassed and angry when it saw him blatantly snatching its spoils of war.

Seeing that the leopard had already widened its eyes and stopped moving, it immediately raised its head and circled around the big tree. It let go of the leopard and rushed towards him angrily\!

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to escape, the leopard that had fallen to the ground suddenly jumped up with a whoosh and bit the python's head\!

The python was shocked. Its upper body was pushed to the ground, and its lower body hurriedly curled up and twisted, winding around it again\!

However, the leopard's sharp teeth had already pierced through its muscles and pierced fiercely into the back of its head\!

The python's entire body distorted in pain and it no longer had the strength to kill\!

Its sharp fangs instantly became useless\!

When the leopard could not resist, it was about to bite a few more times with its poisonous teeth and swallow it. However, because of this cub, in its anger and anxiety, it lost its patience and was careless.

And this time, his carelessness actually turned the leopard's defeat into victory and even made it lose its life\!

It was desperate and unwilling. It looked angrily and hatefully at the cub that was still eating the corpse of the giant crocodile\!

This damn little bastard\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored it and continued to eat the fresh meat.

The prey here was much more delicious than those on the grassland.

It was delicious, juicy, and chewy. Most importantly, there was still a lot of it. One was enough for him to eat his fill. It was more than enough.

The more he ate, the more excited he became. He decided to finish all the good meat and leave his head and tail to this leopard to express his gratitude to it.

The leopard bit the back of the python's head tightly. Its dark eyes were like the expression in the python's eyes, also glaring at him angrily and with hatred.

Chu Xiaoye ignored it and continued to eat.

At this moment, other than glaring, what else could you do other than watching this King enjoy the delicious meal?

Watch carefully\!
