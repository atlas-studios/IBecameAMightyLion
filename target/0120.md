Chapter 120: Hunting

The king was still the king.

Slaves were still slaves.

After the cold father lost his temper, he lay in the shade of the bushes and fell asleep.

After eating its fill, the warthog had to continue working.

It did not have to die. It had food, water, the protection of a lion, and could watch the wonderful show of the lion king being abused by his son for free. What was there to ask for when a pig was born like this?

It only hoped that this cub would let it dig holes forever.

It would never encounter such a beautiful task in a few lifetimes.

As long as it was still useful, it could live happily and enjoy the happy life of eating and sleeping.

I'll dig\!

I'll dig\!

I'll dig, dig, dig\!

In order to show its value and respect in front of this cub, it worked especially hard.

After spending a few days together, it finally realized that this cub without claws was the true supervisor of this pride.

As for the majestic lion king, heh heh, he was nothing\!

The trap from last night had already been discovered by the tiger. He definitely could not use it again.

To prevent the members of the pride from accidentally falling in, Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail supervise this warthog and fill up the hole first.

He naturally had to fill the hole he dug himself. If he did not fill it well, he could not blame everyone for being heartless.

The pit was filled very quickly. There was no need to fill it perfectly. With a little effort, it would be fine as long as the lions did not die.

After filling the hole, Chu Xiaoye asked Little Curly Tail to supervise the warthog and go to the place where the tiger stopped for the first time last night to dig the hole.

Every time the tiger appeared, it would stop here for a while and listen to the surroundings with its ears pricked up. It would open its eyes and search for the small disturbances around it.

Therefore, this place was very suitable for digging holes.

The tiger was injured and should not appear again for the next few days, so he could dig holes with ease.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he brought Catherine and Mei Mei along and taught them to use their sharp claws to peel out the intact bark and tear it into thin strips before making the rope.

Regardless of whether they could be used, this work could at least make their claws and feet more agile.

Many humans' fingers looked agile but were actually very clumsy.

For example, opening one's palm, bending one's index finger or middle finger, or bending one's index finger and ring finger. Many people could not do that.

However, to someone who played the guitar and piano, this action was very simple.

That was because they often practised and developed it.

Some disabled people without both hands learned to eat with their feet and do things. They even learned to play the piano, draw, and type.

There were also people with cerebral palsy who could not move their limbs and had learned to fold planes and boats with their tongues.

Actually, any animal's limbs could be used to complete many difficult manoeuvers through continuous learning.

As long as you were willing to persevere.

Of course, Little Curly Tail would definitely not be able to persist in doing such fine work.

Hence, Chu Xiaoye gave up on him.

He seemed to get along quite well with the pig when he was with it. He even learned how to dig soil from the pig and even learned how to grunt from the pig when he was bored. He was considered diligent and eager to learn. He was a good child.

In the evening.

Under Little Curly Tail's supervision, the warthog dug another two-meter-wide pit. It only needed to deepen it.

Today's work ended here.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not prepare dinner for the warthog this time. There were so many plants around it. It could go to eat alone.

Chu Xiaoye called Little Curly Tail over and asked him to bite the branch into a sharp shape with his teeth so that he could stick it at the bottom of the pit.

Little Curly Tail looked at the warthog and was a little hesitant. However, he still listened to his brother and walked over.

The brothers lowered their heads and prepared the materials.

Catherine and Mei Mei were clumsily and seriously making the rope.

The warthog looked at them and walked in front of the bushes at the side. It lowered its head and used its mouth to dig at the roots of the plants to eat.

After eating, it looked back at them.

No one out of the four cubs noticed it.

If it suddenly jumped into the bushes at the side and relied on the dense bushes, it should have a high chance of escaping.

However, after escaping, where could it go?

Its home was gone, and so was its family. Would a pig be happy wandering around and living in fear all day?

Perhaps it would be caught and eaten by other carnivores as soon as it escaped.

Thinking about it, it was better here.

There was food, drink, and the king of the grassland as his bodyguard. As long as it was still useful to them, their lives would not be in danger.

I better stay.

At the thought of this, the warthog immediately abandoned the thought of escaping and continued to dig for food.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at it and turned his head, signaling Mei Mei and Catherine to relax and continue working.

If the pig dared to escape just now, these two female lions would definitely jump over and bite its neck\!

Fortunately, it knew its limits.

Its speed and intelligence could not be displayed in front of Mei Mei and Catherine.

As long as it stayed here obediently and worked, he would naturally not forget its contributions after he killed the tiger.

It had done hard work even if it had not performed meritorious deeds.

At that time, perhaps he could not eat it and only throw it into this pit to bury it alive, leaving its corpse intact.

Tonight, the four underage lions had to go out to hunt with the pride.

This was their responsibility and their homework.

No fancy learning could compare to practice.

In this dry season where food was scarce, running around for a long time to catch prey could not only make them remember the cruelty of this season and this grassland, it could also leave behind precious experiences for them in the future. It could also make them understand the hardships of their elders and the preciousness of food.

Their current ease did not come from them.

In the future, they would also become such seniors and support the pride. 

Every member of the pride had the responsibility to fight for their pride.

Even if they died from injuries, it was natural.

It was time for Maya to go out and hunt.

Otherwise, the other lionesses would have objections.

Even if they did not have any objections, if they did not catch enough food, no one would remember her.

She could only starve.

Therefore, tonight, she would go out to hunt with the pride.

As for the two young cubs, they could only hide in the hole dug by the warthog and wait for the pride to return.

Chu Xiaoye brought some branches over and placed them in the cave, making the entrance look more hidden.

As for the warthog, Little Curly Tail brought it to the Baobab tree and placed it in the storage room.

After dark.

The cold father set off with the pride.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine and followed behind.

Tonight, if there were no special circumstances, he would never interfere using human intelligence again.

Because if that happened, it would only harm the entire pride.

After they left the camp.

On the Baobab tree, the warthog that had been gloating during the day was trembling in the storage room full of warthog jerky.
