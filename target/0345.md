Chapter 345: Untitled

"Roar\!"

The desolate cry of a jackal came from the quiet grassland.

Many carnivores started to hunt under the cover of the night.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and looked down. The little girl under the tree suddenly covered her stomach and leaned against the tree trunk, twisting her face in pain.

Water in the river, wild cows, and meat.

Humans who were used to living a good life had not tasted it for a long time.

With this human girl's physique, she definitely could not take it.

Looking at her painful expression and helpless struggle, Chu Xiaoye could only sigh in his heart, but he was powerless.

Whether she could survive or not, she could only rely on herself.

Catherine lay in the grass at the side and raised her head, silently looking at the changing emotions in his eyes. She lowered her head and looked at the human girl, her dark eyes filled with confusion.

She did not seem to understand why he cared so much about this little animal that was walking upright.

The little girl rolled on the ground and rolled in pain on the grass. She was sweating and trembling from the pain, but she bit her lips and did not make a sound.

After a long time, she finally quietened down.

She slowly crawled back under the tree, leaned against it, and closed her eyes.

A night passed quietly.

When the sun rose and the first ray of sunlight shone on her pale and exquisite face, her thick and long eyelashes trembled a few times before she slowly opened her eyes.

She finally survived that painful night.

Looking at the fiery red morning sun and smelling the fragrance of the soil and grass on the grassland, it was as if she had been reborn. Her blue eyes were still clear and bright.

Chu Xiaoye climbed down from the tree and called for everyone to set off.

The little girl stood up and followed behind him silently. Although she was a little weak, she did not fall behind.

The journey was smooth.

The golden mane on Chu Xiaoye's neck fluttered on the grassland like a bright flag, showing his might and identity.

No one in the passing pride would forget this young lion king who had once led them to defeat the black lion and return to their home.

Some blind enemies blocked the way. Before Chu Xiaoye's team could attack, the pride took the initiative to attack and help them chase and kill them.

There were also many prides that took the initiative to send over fresh and delicious prey.

Chu Xiaoye was like a king patrolling the territory. He moved freely through the grassland and walked casually, receiving the warm welcome and respect of all the prides.

They walked and stopped. Five days later, they finally arrived at the place where the grassland and the forest bordered.

Seeing that the sun had set and night was approaching, Chu Xiaoye asked the team to stop and rest for the night. They would continue tomorrow.

For lions, the dense and complicated forest was not their ideal resting place. It was more comfortable to rest on the grassland.

Although this team was very strong, they were not strong enough to be afraid of nothing.

There were all sorts of ferocious beasts lurking in the forest, especially after the blood rain. All sorts of mutated beasts emerged endlessly. The chimpanzees, giant crocodiles, pythons, and the bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes he had encountered in the forest previously were not easy to deal with. After this mutation, they would probably become even stronger.

Therefore, it was better to be careful.

It was naturally safer to travel during the day.

The team stopped at the edge of the forest.

The mixed fur, blue eyes, and the others went to the grassland to find the water buffaloes and prepared to eat tonight.

The members of the pride of the cold father stood in place and looked at the distant grassland, seemingly unwilling to leave.

They knew that after this migration, they would probably never return to this place again.

No matter how short the rainy season here was, how long the dry season was, or how difficult their lives were, it was after all where they had been born and where they grew up. They could not help but feel a little emotional.

Especially the cold father. He was confused about the future and uneasy about the other side of the mountain. He did not know if his departure this time was right or wrong.

Originally, if he stayed here, he could enjoy the highest honor of a lion and become the most dazzling and strongest existence on the grassland. All the lions here were grateful and respectful to his pride. Why did he have to leave?

He could not understand.

However, he could not change this unfilial son's decision.

As for staying behind alone like Lars, he naturally could not.

Although he was arrogant, he knew in his heart that all this honor was brought about by this unfilial son. Once his unfilial son left, who on this grassland would care about him?

Lars looked mighty and carefree now, but he was actually just putting on a show. He believed that that kid would soon be beaten back to his original form.

Only by following this unfilial son could they have a good life.

While the members of the cold father's pride were sighing at the grassland, Tilly was very happy. She circled around Chu Xiaoye and even deliberately teased the little girl.

To be honest, she especially disliked this place. It was dirty and messy. It was not as good as theirs.

Furthermore, what was this little thing that walked upright? Why could this little thing lean so close to the smelly fart king and even scratch his fur and tail, but he did not fart to smell her?

She looked so weak. She had no claws, fangs, and a small mouth. Her strength was even weaker. What was the use of leaving her here?

He might as well eat it in one bite\!

Tilly went to the little girl's side and deliberately bared her fangs to scare her.

The little girl seemed to have already understood her temper. She widened her eyes and looked at the pearl on her neck with a very envious look.

Tilly was immediately delighted. She raised her neck and deliberately swayed the pearl with a pleased expression. Then, she glanced at her, as if she was saying, "This is mine. Don't even think about it\!"

Seeing that she was very happy, the little girl extended her little hand again and looked like she wanted to touch her.

Tilly immediately took a few steps back and looked at her warily. Then, she turned her head proudly and walked away, continuing to shake the pearl on her neck.

No one could touch her baby\!

The little girl's blue eyes revealed a smile.

Chu Xiaoye looked at this scene and sighed inwardly. The intelligence of humans was indeed innately strong. They were even more skilled in schemes.

Tilly was already immersed in pride and joy and no longer had the mood to scare this little girl.

Although this was good, Chu Xiaoye felt that he had to kill this little white lion's annoying and arrogant attitude.

"Roarâ€”"

He growled and attracted the little white lion's gaze.

Then, he turned around, raised his claws, and pushed aside the collar on the little girl's neck, revealing the pearl necklace that was flickering with seven-colored light.

Tilly's pleased expression instantly stiffened and her eyes suddenly widened.

Not only her, Catherine, Mei Mei, and Molly, who were at the side, also suddenly widened their eyes in disbelief.
