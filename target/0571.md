Chapter 571: The Dinosaur Army

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this critical moment, an arrow suddenly shot out of the canopy and hit the pterodactyl's eye\!

The pterodactyl was shocked. It hurriedly flapped its wings and flew up, quickly escaping. In the blink of an eye, it flew into the clouds and disappeared.

The giant gorilla looked back and did not discover anything. It continued forward.

Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief and gave Denise, who was beside him, a thumbs up. He whispered, "Good archery\!"

At this moment, they were hiding on the canopy of this huge tree and could clearly see the three big boats on the shallows and the densely packed cannonballs that flew up the island.

The Southern Tang Navy fled in fear, but they could not escape the iron hooves of the dinosaur army\!

In less than a moment, the furious dinosaurs drowned the more than 1,000 Southern Tang soldiers like a tide and knocked them to the ground, trampling them into meat paste.

Under the lead of the giant gorilla, the dinosaur army continued to charge forward and rushed towards the two big ships that were holding artillery in the shallows.

At this moment, Qin Zhitan, who was standing on the deck looking out, finally discovered the abnormality of the island.

"Cease fire\! Cease fire\!"

Qin Zhitan's expression changed drastically and he hurriedly shouted.

The artillery immediately stopped, but the dinosaur army did not stop. They would never let go of these alien species that had destroyed their environment\!

"Quick\! Jump ship\! Return to our own ship\!"

Qin Zhitan saw the giant gorilla and the terrifying dinosaur army. He was shocked and terrified. As he shouted, he went over and pulled Qin Mo'er and Little Guai to run towards the ship.

Now, these two military boats were already in the shallows. It was impossible to drive them away immediately. They could only abandon the boat and escape\!

The members of the Qin family and Old Wu's crew jumped off the ship and ran towards the merchant ship not far away.

Fortunately, most people were seamen who were very comfortable in water and were very fast. They immediately climbed onto the merchant ship and started to start the ship.

Those who did not know how to swim were carried by the good swimmers and boarded the boat in time.

"Start the ship\! Start the ship\!"

Seeing that everyone had boarded the ship, Qin Zhitan immediately shouted.

The terrifying dinosaur army had already rushed to the beach and was charging towards the two military boats with a murderous aura. They jumped up from the shallows and jumped onto the two military boats, starting to destroy crazily.

The terrifying giant gorilla also walked over. It suddenly threw the huge tree on its shoulder and flew out like a cannonball. With a bang, it smashed the cabin of one of the military boats into pieces\!

"Roar\!"

It beat its chest and let out a deafening roar. It suddenly ran and jumped up, landing heavily on the deck of one of the military ships. It actually stepped on the military ship and sank it into the sand below, creating a big hole on the deck\!

The giant gorilla swung its fists and started to smash randomly on the ship. Every punch rumbled and was extremely destructive.

On the merchant ship that was quickly sailing away, everyone looked at this scene in fear. If they had left the two military ships a step later, they would have been torn to pieces by those terrifying monsters long ago\!

The giant gorilla suddenly raised its head, seemingly seeing them. It immediately jumped down from the deck and landed in the sea, then actually chased after them.

Qin Zhitan's expression changed drastically and he hurriedly shouted, "Quick\! Quick\!"

The others also cried out in fear.

The crew, who were in control of the ship, immediately increased their horsepower and made the ship move quickly.

The giant gorilla let out a roar and started to run into the sea. It was very fast\!

"Whoosh\!"

It actually jumped up from the sea and landed only seven to eight meters behind the merchant ship.

The people on the ship were terrified. As they shouted, they prepared to jump off the ship.

The seawater covered the giant gorilla's chest\!

It bared its fangs and roared angrily. It continued to walk forward and stepped to the back of the ship. It raised its huge fist and prepared to smash the tail of this big ship\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this critical moment, a huge fin suddenly appeared in the sea. Then, a bloody plate opened its mouth in the water, revealing two rows of sharp fangs. With a crack, it bit hard on the thick thigh of the giant gorilla\!

"Roar\!"

The huge gorilla immediately let out a miserable scream. It raised its fist and smashed into the water with a bang, hitting the head of the underwater killer\!

The underwater killer struggled a few times before flipping over alone and floating up. It was actually a huge shark. Although it was smaller than this huge gorilla, its two rows of teeth were extremely terrifying\!

Blood quickly spread in the sea.

Suddenly, more huge fins appeared not far away\!

They were actually sharks\!

The strong smell of blood quickly spread in the rippling sea. The sharks were extremely excited and surged over crazily\!

The giant gorilla's thigh was already injured. Seeing this scene, it did not dare to stay any longer. It hurriedly turned around and limped towards the shore.

It was the overlord of the island, but these sharks were the overlords of the sea. In their territory, no matter how powerful it was, it could only escape.

At this moment, the merchant ship finally fled and quickly headed towards the distant sea\!

The sharks surged over and started to crazily eat the corpse of their companion.

The giant gorilla had already fled ashore and was roaring from the shore, as if it was cursing something.

The two military boats had been completely destroyed by the dinosaurs\!

Under the threat of the sharks, the dinosaurs did not dare to stay in the sea for long and fled ashore.

This battle finally ended.

The residents of these islands used their courage and ferocity to chase away the enemy.

Chu Xiaoye and the others, who were hiding on the canopy of the huge tree, witnessed the crushing battle with their own eyes. They still hid there and did not dare to move.

The giant gorilla was injured and started to limp into the forest towards the valley in the middle.

The dinosaurs also returned in twos and threes.

The journey was rather peaceful and no battles happened.

Chu Xiaoye and the others hid above and looked at the ferocious beasts that passed by below. They did not even dare to breathe.

After the giant gorilla and the dinosaur walked out of a forest borrowed by wolves, they quickly climbed down the tree and ran towards the sea.

"Night, the ship seems to have left."

Lanisi followed behind him and said worriedly.

Chu Xiaoye ran in front and said, "They didn't go far. They will definitely return."

He had seen it clearly from above just now. After the big ship left the sharks for a long distance, it stopped.

He believed that Qin Zhitan would not abandon them. At least, the people on the ship would not abandon the twenty Qin family members, although they did not know that the twenty Qin family members were already dead.

When they ran out of the forest, a familiar cry suddenly came from above\!

The cry was extremely sharp, as if it was filled with hatred.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the pterodactyl that Denise had shot came back\!

The arrow was still stuck in its eyes. It circled in the air and let out sharp cries. More pterodactyls suddenly flew over from the surrounding sky, covering half the sky\!

It was here to take revenge\!

There were still sharks wandering in the sea.

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and could only turn around and return to the forest with the girl.

The giant gorilla was already injured and should not come out for the time being. The dinosaurs had just exhausted too much energy and would not rush over for a while.

Therefore, the only thing they needed to deal with now was the pterodactyls in the sky\!
