Chapter 382: Untitled

"Bang\!"

Another water buffalo was knocked to the ground.

The crazy water buffalo was unstoppable for a moment and killed whoever it encountered. It killed until the water buffaloes that had just shared a common enemy aggressively became terrified and fled in all directions.

It was not that other water buffaloes could not defeat it, but it was too terrifying and had already become a bloodthirsty and cruel monster. Even if it fell, it could quickly get up. Even if it was fatally injured, it was still fierce and fast\!

"Chi—"

A water buffalo that had been knocked to the ground had its stomach cut open.

The crazy water buffalo seemed to have suddenly sensed something and suddenly turned around. Its eyes were blood red and its face was ferocious as it prepared to attack.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and a figure fell from the sky\!

Blood sprayed and the cow head fell to the ground\!

Even though this terrifying monster's skull was broken and it had suffered a fatal wound, it was still lively. After pausing in place for a few seconds, it finally fell to the ground with a bang and blood flowed\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground, walked close, and fiddled with the bloody cow head with his claws.

The bull head suddenly widened its eyes and opened its mouth. Its face was distorted, and it seemed to be preparing to bite. However, it no longer had the strength and soon stopped moving.

After the corpse beside him twitched for a while, it completely quietened down.

The panicked giant water buffaloes did not stop because of the death of this crazy bull. They quickly fled without a trace.

Chu Xiaoye observed the cow head and its scarlet and bloodthirsty eyes carefully. Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei's excited roars suddenly came from behind.

The members of the pride rushed out of the bushes and ran around the water buffaloes' corpses.

They could eat these dead water buffaloes for a few days\!

Chu Xiaoye's eyes revealed a grave expression. He thought carefully for a while before suddenly turning around and roaring into the bushes.

Soon, Pit brought the two huge warthogs and rushed over.

Chu Xiaoye pointed at the location on the distant grass and let them dig a big pit here. At the same time, he instructed Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others to transport the water buffaloes' corpses over.

The three warthogs immediately buried themselves in work.

Little Curly Tail thought that his brother wanted to store all these prey and eat them when he was hungry. Therefore, he worked especially hard.

His broken tail not only healed, it grew out again. It was very magical.

After working for half a day, the three warthogs finally dug a big and deep pit in the grass. It was enough to bury the dead water buffaloes.

After digging the pit, Chu Xiaoye instructed Little Curly Tail and the others to throw the water buffalo corpses in and bury them.

At this moment, everyone woke up. If the water buffaloes were buried in the soil, could they still eat? Their king did not look like he was storing food\! Could it be that they were going to throw away all these prey?

Little Curly Tail looked at his brother in confusion.

The cold father was furious. He felt that this unfilial son was wasting food and courting death\!

The other members were also puzzled.

With so many water buffalo corpses, it was enough for them to eat for a few days. Furthermore, they would not decay too quickly.

Only Catherine did not hesitate and immediately dragged a water buffalo into the pit and dragged a second one.

The Jerry brothers also did not hesitate and immediately followed the orders.

Jiela and the female lions felt their hearts ache.

One had to know that when they were wandering in the past, they were almost starved to death. They had once fought other lions and hyenas to death for a little rotten meat. Now, they actually had to throw away such a fresh prey. How could their hearts not ache?

"Roar—"

Seeing that everyone was hesitating, Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and looked at them sternly, telling them to listen and not dawdle.

Seeing that his brother had made up his mind, Little Curly Tail did not dare to hesitate anymore. He decided to eat a few bites before throwing them away.

Just as he opened his mouth and was about to bite the beef, Chu Xiaoye suddenly pounced over and swung his claws. With a bang, he actually slapped him away. The strength was so great that the cold father beside him trembled in fear and almost sat on the ground.

Little Curly Tail landed heavily on the ground and got up from the ground. His face was burning with pain. He widened his eyes and looked at his brother in shock.

What did he do wrong? Didn't he just want to eat a few bites of meat that was about to be buried?

Was he wrong?

Chu Xiaoye looked at him coldly, revealing a terrifying killing intent.

Mei Mei, who was at the side, was terrified. She hurriedly dragged a water buffalo into the pit and did not dare to hesitate anymore.

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur looked at each other and did not hesitate anymore. They immediately dragged the other water buffaloes' corpses.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the cold father at the side.

The cold father's legs turned limp, but he glared angrily. After looking at this unfilial son bravely for three seconds, he quietly turned around and went to help Mei Mei drag the water buffalo.

"A wise man does not fight when the odds are against him\! This unfilial son will suffer retribution sooner or later\!"

The cold father said angrily.

Molly was panting as she dragged another water buffalo, but because the water buffalo was too big and no one helped, she could not move it.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Little Curly Tail and walked over step by step.

After Little Curly Tail stayed in place for a while, he immediately jumped up and ran over. He curled his tail and helped Molly drag the water buffalo away.

He looked at his brother faintly, feeling wronged. Why was he always the one who was injured? Why was he the one who always killed the chicken to warn the monkeys?

He felt that it was so unfair. At least it should be Mei Mei's turn.

"Idiot\!"

Little Curly Tail turned around and glared at Molly, looking like he disliked this female cub very much. He subconsciously vented his anger on this female cub.

Molly turned her head and ignored him.

Soon, the dead water buffaloes were thrown into the pit and the three warthogs started to bury themselves in the soil.

The female lions stood by the pit and looked at the water buffaloes that were buried by the soil bit by bit. Their eyes revealed unwillingness and frustration.

The few lions did not matter. Anyway, they had food to eat.

After the pit was filled, Chu Xiaoye looked at the members of the pride with a dignified gaze again and warned them sternly that they were not to approach this place again, nor were they to secretly dig it out to eat. Otherwise, he would personally kill those who did not listen to orders\!

The members of the pride lowered their heads and did not dare to disobey.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that even his mother, Aisha, might not understand his actions.

He also hoped that he was wrong.

After the pride left, a vulture circling in the sky quickly left.

Peace returned to the grassland.

The smell of blood from the water buffalo drifted in the wind and drifted further away.

Before the sun set, a group of predators came after hearing the news.
