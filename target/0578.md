Chapter 578: Hunting

"Bang\!"

A gunshot suddenly came from afar. In the quiet night, it was exceptionally clear.

This gunshot seemed to have landed in Chu Xiaoye's heart, causing his entire body to tremble.

He had not heard this sound for a long time and almost forgot these terrifying weapons that could kill all animals.

Humans came to the grassland.

The animals on the grassland had only two choices.

He continued to stay here, waiting for the sudden gunshots and death one day.

Or migrate away to a place further away from humans.

However, this world did not exist.

This gunshot woke Chu Xiaoye up.

If the pride stayed here, they might be killed by humans with guns on that day.

He wanted to save the cold father and Mei Mei, but he could not risk it on the other members of the pride.

The sky in the east gradually turned white.

No one slept that night.

When the sky was about to brighten, Chu Xiaoye walked in front of Catherine and looked at her dark eyes, expressing his intentions solemnly.

"Take them and leave first."

He hoped that Catherine could let Little Curly Tail and the others pass through the barrier and take refuge in another world.

Only Catherine knew that path and knew that Catherine could enter the snow forest to communicate with the elves.

This mission was hers.

As for him, he still had to stay here for the time being to save the cold father and Mei Mei.

If the cold father and Mei Mei had already encountered misfortune, he would leave after taking revenge.

Catherine turned around and rejected his orders stubbornly.

She was unwilling to leave.

She only wanted to follow behind him, no matter where she went or if she could survive.

The female cub did not know how terrifying humans were.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Nunu and Qiqi, who were playing not far away, and at his mother and the other lionesses. These were his family. If they died under a human gun, he really could not accept it.

He had already regretted not leaving with everyone back then. Now, if he could not bring everyone to a safe place and stubbornly save the cold father and Mei Mei, if anything happened, he would probably live in pain for the rest of his life.

"Catherine, be obedient. Take them and leave first. I will definitely return."

Chu Xiaoye expressed his intentions again. This time, it was not an order, but a plea.

Catherine still looked elsewhere and did not respond. She used silence to express her intentions.

"Brother, I'm not leaving\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly walked over and expressed his intentions firmly.

He did not want to be separated from his brother again, never.

Furthermore, his father and Mei Mei had been captured by humans, and he had the responsibility to save them.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and continued to look at the female cub in front of him. He was silent for a while before saying, "Catherine, if you leave with them and send them to the elves safely, when I return, I'llâ€¦"

Catherine suddenly turned around and looked at him. Her eyes trembled and shone in the night.

"I'll agree to one request of yours."

Chu Xiaoye said sincerely.

Catherine stared intently at his eyes and summoned her courage to express her intentions. "Any request?"

Chu Xiaoye nodded and said, "Any request."

Catherine fell silent again.

Then, she raised her head and took two steps forward. She raised her face and looked at him from below. After looking at him for a while, she lowered her head and rubbed the mane on his neck gently. Then, she raised her head and stared at his eyes, saying her request.

"Promise me that you will return."

This was her request, her only request.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her eyes that were filled with tears and was a little absent-minded for a moment. Images of the female cub back then unconsciously surfaced in his mind.

"I promise you."

Chu Xiaoye said with a determined gaze.

Catherine lowered her head and slowly retreated to the side. Her back was lonely and she was as lonely as before.

"Brother, I'm not leaving\!"

Little Curly Tail expressed his intentions stubbornly again.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the head and slapped him to the ground.

He would not have a good expression when facing this kid.

"If you don't leave, who will protect Qiqi and Nunu along the way? Who will protect their mother? Can Catherine do it alone?"

Now that all sorts of animals were escaping, they would definitely encounter more powerful ferocious beasts on the way. No matter how powerful Catherine was, she could not do anything.

Little Curly Tail lay on the ground, feeling wronged and about to cry.

"We'll set off at dawn. We can't delay\!"

Chu Xiaoye gave him an ultimatum.

Although they had just met and he was unwilling to leave, the situation was critical now. Humans ran around with guns every day. If he did not leave soon, he might never be able to leave again one day.

Some things had to be decisive.

Chu Xiaoye walked over and bid farewell to his mother, Xi'er, Molly, and the other members. He told them to follow Catherine and go to another place to build a new home.

Everyone was unwilling to leave, but they knew that they could not stay here anymore. If they hesitated, there would only be death.

Furthermore, it was useless for them to stay. They could only be burdens.

Aisha licked his fur lovingly and reluctantly. Xi'er rubbed his neck gently, and Qiqi and Nunu came to bid him farewell.

Molly also rubbed his body.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that Molly was pregnant. The female cub's movements were not normal. She was clearly pregnant.

A lion had the sharpest sense of smell about whether a lioness was pregnant.

He turned around and looked at Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail was suddenly a little embarrassed. He twisted his body and opened his mouth, looking comical as if he wanted to laugh but did not dare to.

Chu Xiaoye was quite happy. The pride finally started to spread their branches.

However, he felt the pressure on his shoulders increase.

"There's no need to wait for dawn. Leave now\! Immediately\! Immediately\!"

Chu Xiaoye decided and growled, informing Catherine and all the members of the pride.

"Bang\!"

Right at this moment, a gunshot suddenly sounded not far in front of him.

Then, a lion's roar sounded.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Gunshots sounded continuously and the lion roar immediately quietened down.

At the same time, the sound of hooves rang out and they were approaching.

"Quick\! Hide in the cave\!"

"Quick\! Hide in the cave\!"

This rock hill was full of thorns and strange rocks. The horses could not pass through and it was difficult for humans to walk. Furthermore, it was not bright yet, so they should not dare to come and take the risk.

Little Curly Tail immediately brought the members of the pride and crawled under the bushes into the cave.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine also walked over and hid in the dense bushes and huge rocks.

He reminded Catherine to bury her head and hide her eyes.

In the dark of the grassland, they could see everything around them, but their eyes that were shining in the night had become the most striking mark of humans discovering them.

They had to hide their eyes and listen with their ears.

"Woof\! Woof\! Woof\!"

The sound of a hunting dog could be heard\!

The world had already become like this and humans had already retreated to all sorts of remote places. Could they still not forget those cruel entertainment?

Hounds?

This thing also wanted to flaunt its might here?

Chu Xiaoye's heart surged with anger. A cold light flickered in his eyes and his body naturally emitted the aura of a terrifying ferocious beast.

Before the few barking hounds could approach, they suddenly whimpered and turned to run with their tails between their legs. They peed their pants.
