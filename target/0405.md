Chapter 405: Untitled

"Wow—"

At this moment, a frog-like cry suddenly came from a patch of bushes at the side.

Chu Xiaoye looked over. On the wide bushes that were like banana leaves, a colorful little animal was lying on them. It was puffing its cheeks and looking at them with its eyes wide.

The little animal looked rather similar to a frog, but its color was too beautiful. Although it was small, it was not afraid of the pride in front of it. It was like a venomous arrow frog in a tropical rainforest\!

It seemed that Little Curly Tail had been ambushed by this little animal.

Chu Xiaoye realized that this forest was rather damp. The bushes were covered in raindrops and the soil on the ground was relatively soft, as if it had just rained.

The air was also filled with a humid aura.

Little Curly Tail looked at the broken tail that had turned black on the ground and immediately understood. He immediately bared his fangs and roared at the little animal that looked like a frog with a fierce expression.

However, he seemed to have lingering fear towards the pain just now. Although his roar was exceptionally fierce, he did not dare to approach the little animal again.

On the grassland, a strong body might be able to defeat all enemies, but not here.

However, how could he not take revenge for losing his tail?

Little Curly Tail turned around and looked at his brother in grievance.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

Before the poisonous frog that was flaunting its might on the bushes could react, it was instantly cut in half and fell from the bushes, landing on the ground in a sorry state.

As for the bushes, they were intact\!

Chu Xiaoye was still very fast\!

Little Curly Tail immediately swayed his broken tail in a fawning manner and leaned over. He stuck out his tongue and wanted to express his gratitude, but he slapped him away.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to let this kid open the way in front anymore, afraid that he would encounter danger again.

This ancient forest was clearly more lively and dangerous than the previous forest.

He personally led the way and slowed down, carefully checking the situation in front.

Catherine followed closely behind him, her dark eyes flickering with two cold lights. She was always paying attention to her surroundings.

The leaves on the ground were thick and rustled when they were stepped on.

The birds that were chirping on the branches were frightened by this pride of grassland lions and flapped their wings to leave.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a roar suddenly sounded from the distant grassland\!

Then, roars rose and fell in the forest.

They were the roars of lions\!

From the sounds, at least six lions were gathered\!

Even on the grassland, this was extremely ridiculous.

The lion's appetite was extremely astonishing. Unless there was a very wide territory, food, and resources, and a certain number of female lions, it was difficult for lions to gather together.

Furthermore, the forest was not like the grassland. Without many herbivores, it was difficult to feed them.

No one knew if this group of lions had lived here long ago or if they had fled here like them.

However, Chu Xiaoye was rather happy to hear the roars of his own kind in the forest.

He did not care if the other party's roar was threatening or warning. He immediately brought the pride and walked towards the forest that was roaring.

The other members of the pride looked very excited.

After escaping for so long, they finally encountered their own kind. Even if they were enemies and an unhappy conflict happened, they were very happy.

When Chu Xiaoye rushed to the forest with the pride, he suddenly smelled a strong smell of blood.

The lions that had been roaring just now suddenly stopped moving.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. He slowed down and walked for a distance before finally seeing the few lions.

The six lions had already fallen into a pool of blood. Their skulls were crushed and their eyes were wide with fear. They were completely dead\!

These six lions were not too big. Clearly, they did not come from the grassland near the sea. The reason why they could survive until now should be because they were extremely united.

However, just a few minutes ago, they were still roaring, warning the other enemies nearby that this was their territory and they were not allowed to enter.

Now, they had all been killed.

To be able to shatter their skulls in such a short time and leave calmly after killing them, such an enemy was indeed terrifying\!

Or perhaps, there was more than one enemy\!

"Roar —"

Right at this moment, the male leopard, Blue, suddenly raised its head and let out a roar. Its muscles were tense as if it was facing a great enemy\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly looked up and saw another strong male leopard standing on the tree above him\!

No\!

It did not seem to be a leopard\!

The animal's fur was covered in black and yellow patterns that were extremely similar to that of leopards. However, its body shape and movements were like that of a tiger\!

Its tail was shorter than a leopard's and its head was very big. Its limbs were not as long as a leopard's and it looked thick and strong. It also looked more ferocious.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. It was a jaguar\!

The jaguar looked similar to a leopard, but its size and hunting skills were similar to that of a tiger and it was much stronger than a leopard.

This animal could be said to be the top predator in the forest. Be it flying in the sky, jumping on the tree, running on land, or swimming in the river, they were all on its menu.

Furthermore, this animal could move and hunt very quickly, be it in the sea, land, or air.

Its sneak attack skills and strength made many animals tremble in fear. He could even jump into the water and kill the crocodiles in the water, then bring them ashore to enjoy them.

Lions, tigers, and leopards generally liked to lock their prey's throats or necks when hunting, waiting for the other party to suffocate or bleed to death. As for jaguars, they liked to bite through their skulls and kill them in one move\!

The leopard in front of him had clearly evolved and mutated. It was taller and stronger than Blue, who had strong genes. It was not inferior to Blue and was even stronger.

More importantly, Chu Xiaoye saw a crystal whisker beside its mouth flickering.

Obviously, the sudden death of the six lions on the ground was caused by it.

At this moment, facing so many lions, this jaguar was not afraid at all. It was still standing on the tree above him, calm and composed, looking down coldly.

Furthermore, it did not look at the lion that was the most threatening to it. Instead, it was staring at the female leopard, Belita.

Blue keenly sensed its intentions and immediately walked to Belita's side to protect her. He raised his head and let out an angry roar.

Belita looked up, but she was confused.

"Whoosh\!"

The jaguar on the tree suddenly pounced down without warning, but it did not pounce on Blue. Instead, it pounced at Chu Xiaoye\!
