Chapter 355: Untitled

 "Bam\!"

The little girl fell to the ground and hurriedly got up and ran to the side.

The headless corpse vomited blood and slowly tilted. Then, it fell to the ground and twitched non-stop.

Chu Xiaoye stood beside the corpse. His golden claws were stained with a few drops of blood. As for the few drops of blood, they slowly disappeared at a visible speed. They did not fall, as if they had been absorbed by the golden claws.

A strange heat seeped into his body from his claws and flowed towards the heat in his abdomen, mixing with it.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt his throat go dry and his neck was tightly held. He felt like he could not breathe.

Right at this moment, a warm current suddenly jumped out of his body and surged into his throat. He really wanted to roar, but he realized that he could not roar at all.

However, soon, this uncomfortable feeling quickly subsided and returned to normal.

The savage's head rolled not far from the corpse. His eyes were wide open and his face was still fierce and ferocious. He looked terrifying.

Chu Xiaoye's head was in pain and his entire body was weak. He wanted to walk over to see Catherine's situation, but he realized that it was difficult for him to take another step. He could only slowly lie on the ground and close his eyes to rest.

That claw just now had already exhausted all his strength and energy.

His head felt like it was about to explode.

The might of the savage's last roar was obvious\!

Tilly was covered in blood as she squatted on a rock near the cliff. Her chest was heaving violently and she looked very tired.

As for the twenty-over chimpanzees, they all fell in a pool of blood. Some of the chimpanzees were not killed by her and Catherine. Instead, their internal organs were shattered by the roar of the savages and they died.

Catherine's body moved and she slowly raised her head. She looked at him and lowered her head again.

"Chi\!"

A light sound\!

The sharp knife in the little girl's hand actually pierced into the heart of the black gorilla that had been holding her hostage\!

The black gorilla was not dead but had fainted from the final roar of the savage. At this moment, it was suddenly stabbed in the heart by a small knife. Its body immediately trembled and it opened its eyes to glare at the little girl. Its lips trembled a few times, as if it wanted to roar, but it no longer had the strength. Soon, its head tilted and it died completely.

At this moment, the little girl relaxed. She pulled out her knife and stood up. She ran in front of Chu Xiaoye while trembling and rubbed his head, as if she was comforting him.

On this cold mountain peak, the ground was covered in blood and corpses, but it was dead silent.

An hour later.

Chu Xiaoye finally opened his eyes and stood up.

The little girl immediately cried tears of joy. She hugged his neck and buried her exquisite face in his thick mane, saying grateful words.

Chu Xiaoye broke free of her and walked to Catherine's side.

Catherine sensed his aura and raised her head, looking at him with her dark eyes. Seeing that he was fine, she relaxed and stood up with difficulty.

There was still blood in her nose and mouth.

The savage's punch just now could crush a rock even if it hit one. Fortunately, he had been indebted to him since he was young. His physique was special and his bones were tough. He only suffered some internal injuries and was not fatal.

If it were any other lion, their heads would have long shattered and they would have died.

He was extremely touched by the female cub's courage to risk her life to save him just now.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and rubbed her head, his eyes filled with gentleness.

At this moment, Tilly growled and walked over. She raised her claws and pointed at the chimpanzees that she had killed to show that she had done more.

At the same time, she turned around to show that she was injured too.

Chu Xiaoye nodded to show that he knew and expressed his gratitude. However, he only thanked her and did not do anything else.

This made Tilly furious.

After resting for a while, Chu Xiaoye brought them slowly down the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye was a little flustered.

Because he realized that he could not roar anymore.

Although he opened his mouth and used his aura to want to growl, he could not make any sound, as if something was suddenly blocking his throat.

However, the strange thing was that he did not feel any discomfort.

He opened his mouth and tried many times, but it was still useless. He was even more pitiful than a mute.

At least a mute could "ah ah ah" and still make many strange sounds. However, the current him could not even make a sound. He was even inferior to a newborn baby.

What was going on?

Could he have been beaten by that savage?

However, there was no pain in his throat, nor was there any wound.

Due to the fact that the path down the mountain was rather steep and the ground was filled with rugged rocks, the little girl followed behind him and kept using her two little hands to grab his tail to go down the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to kick her out. If she could withstand the kick as well as Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

Tilly saw the desire and went behind him. She opened her mouth to bite his tail, but he kicked her nose and kicked her mercilessly to the ground.

Tilly roared angrily and jumped up. She glared at him as if she was cursing.

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth but did not retort.

Tilly looked angrily at the little girl and bared her fangs, as if she wanted to scare her.

The little girl did not look at her. Her two little hands grabbed Chu Xiaoye's tail tightly and she jumped down the mountain. Her two golden pigtails swayed back and forth in front of her chest, and she could not help but hum a nice children's song. She looked very happy.

Tilly and Catherine were immediately stunned by the sound she made.

This sound was sometimes loud and sometimes small, sometimes up and down, sometimes fast and sometimes slow. It was usually small and sweet and crisp. It was even more pleasant to hear than the birds' cries on the tree in the morning sun.

Tilly could not help but put away her fangs and follow behind. She listened in a daze, and a strange feeling suddenly appeared in her heart.

Catherine also lowered her head and followed behind, intoxicated by the little girl's childish and pure singing.

At this moment, the night retreated.

On the distant horizon, a fiery red morning sun quietly peeked out half of its face and peeped at this world that seemed to be still immersed in the night.

The little girl's singing drifted in the morning wind and woke up this forest that had slept for the night with the birds that had woken up in the forest.

When the sun rose, everything was full of vitality.

Chu Xiaoye's throat still could not make any sound, but his heart was beating with the little girl's song. A stream of air lingered in his chest and was eager to move, as if it was always charging towards his throat.

He opened his mouth and swayed his head up and down as he followed the little girl's tune. The golden mane on his neck swayed gently like a blooming flower under the sun and in the mountain wind. It was graceful.
