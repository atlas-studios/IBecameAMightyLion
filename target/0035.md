Chapter 35: Staying Alive

Chu Xiaoye did not understand.

Therefore, he did not dare or could not bear to guess.

He turned his head away, unable to watch.

He felt terrible, sad and miserable.

Of course.

He felt more anger and hatred.

He would remember this day.

He remembered Gigi's tragic death.

The Samantha Hyena Packâ€”the damn culprits. From today on, the most violent and cruel revenge would befall them\!

If he were a human, he might think that this was how the animal world worked.

Hyenas and lions had been enemies for generations and had always been killing each other.

This was how it was. There was no right or wrong.

But.

He was a lion now, Gigi's brother, and a man of the pride\!

What flowed in his body was the blood of a lion and his hatred for hyenas\!

Therefore, he had to take revenge\!

He wanted to let those despicable ambushers know that lions were the king of the grassland and the overlords of this place\!

He wanted to make those bastards tremble in fear\!

The air was filled with a strong smell of blood and sadness.

The lion, the cold father, and the lioness, Callie, returned.

Callie walked to Maya's side and looked at the blood on the ground in silence, her eyes sad and guilty.

The cold father looked at the remaining four young cubs and then at the female lions. Then, he walked to the camp in front and enjoyed the prey the female lions brought back alone.

Chu Xiaoye did not know how he felt as a father.

However, from the experiences of the pride during this period of time, as the lion king of the territory, he did not fulfill his duties.

Other than protecting their territory, the lion also had to protect the lionesses and young cubs.

However, out of the eight young cubs, only four were left.

These four were also riddled with wounds.

The female lion, Xi'er, also almost died when fighting alone.

Their pride was not only bullied by hyenas, they were also bullied by water buffaloes and even baboons.

Could this still be considered the most powerful predator on the grassland?

As a lion, as a lion king, and as a father, he had failed in his duties.

However, who dared to pursue this?

His strength made the female lions silent.

However, the silence would not last forever.

When the day came that the female lions realized how useless he was, he would regret it forever\!

Every animal would be sad.

The same went for lions.

However, they would never be like humans who had too much time and energy to grieve.

The only thing they wished and worked hard for was survival.

As for why humans committed suicide, they might never understand it in their lives.

Life was so precious and it was so difficult to survive. Who was willing to give up like this?

Perhaps only an idiot would do so.

The female lions started to eat.

Lars looked at Chu Xiaoye with a complicated gaze and limped away too.

Beside Chu Xiaoye lay eight dead hyenas.

Their deaths were extremely tragic.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called for Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail to come over.

His saliva could be used as a disinfectant.

The lionesses' saliva would definitely not be as effective as his.

He had saved Xi'er, who was riddled with wounds and about to die, back then. That was the best proof.

Mei Mei was the least injured. She limped over slowly.

Little Curly Tail was covered in wounds. Although he did not have as many wounds as Chu Xiaoye's, they were all very serious.

He felt that he might be hopeless.

Even his mother, Aisha, felt that he would definitely not survive after being so seriously injured.

However, since his brother called him, he had to crawl over no matter what.

He was a lion, a brave and strong lion. He must not lose to Meimei, the female cub, in front of his brother\!

Little Curly Tail moved his body, endured the pain in his body, and slowly crawled towards Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye was licking the wounds on Mei Mei's body and applying a layer of saliva on every one of them.

As for his own wounds, it seemed that he did not need to lick them.

It was not that he could not lick them, but the strange heat in his body was surging throughout his body, seemingly healing his wounds.

The wound that had been hurting intensely just now was starting to get hot and itchy, as if it was being healed.

The blood stopped flowing.

He decided to wait and see.

Little Curly Tail was riddled with wounds and dripping with blood. He finally endured the pain and crawled in front of him.

After Chu Xiaoye finished licking Meimei's wounds, he immediately started doing it for him.

Little Curly Tail was still trembling from the pain at first. After a while, he narrowed his eyes in comfort and even took the initiative to extend his butt in front of him for him to lick it too.

Chu Xiaoye spat out a few mouthfuls of saliva and smeared it on Little Curly Tail's butt with his claws.

The wound on Mei Mei's hind leg was rather serious. She was originally in so much pain that she could not walk. But now, she suddenly felt a cool sensation and the pain gradually disappeared.

She tried to stand on her hind legs and took two steps. Although she was still in pain, she was much better than before\!

She was extremely excited. She immediately leaned close to Chu Xiaoye and stuck out her tongue, preparing to lick his wounds.

However, before she could start, Chu Xiaoye slapped her away.

Aisha and Xi'er carried two pieces of fresh meat. They walked over from the front and placed them in front of the three little fellows.

Little Curly Tail swallowed his saliva but did not eat it immediately. Instead, he looked at his brother.

Chu Xiaoye had no appetite, especially when he thought of the scene of Gigi being eaten by the hyenas and her mother eating the remaining half of her body.

Gigi's blood was beside him.

He needed to calm down.

Seeing that he was not eating, Little Curly Tail wolfed down the food.

Mei Mei immediately started eating.

They had expended a lot of energy fighting the hyenas with their lives just now, and now they were all hungry.

Aisha looked at Little Curly Tail wolfing down his food. The sadness in her eyes gradually turned to joy.

Her child should be able to survive strongly.

Xi'er walked in front of the hyenas' corpses and looked at them in bewilderment for a while before looking up at Chu Xiaoye.

The appearances of these hyenas were extremely tragic. Some had their stomachs cut open, some had their heads cut open, and some had their necks bitten off. There was also one whose entire head fell off its neck\!

Was this battle result caused by a lion that was still underage?

She found it unbelievable\!

Even if it was an adult lion, their king could not have killed so many hyenas despite being surrounded by them, right?

Furthermore, the state of death of these hyenas was extremely terrifying. It did not seem like it could be achieved with ordinary biting\!

"Roar\!"

When Mei Mei saw her mother looking at the hyena corpses on the ground, she immediately put down the food in her mouth and ran to the grass not far away. She bit the neck of the male hyena's corpse on the ground and brought it over with a pleased expression.

She seemed to be saying: Mom, Mom, look, I bit a hyena to death too\!

Xi'er's eyes were filled with relief.

Little Curly Tail ate the meat and looked up with disdain and ridicule.

It was as if he was saying: What are you showing off for\! I bit a total of three hyenas to death\!

Then.

He turned around and looked at his brother, then at the hyenas' corpses around him, feeling even more pleased and proud.

"My brother is the best\!"
