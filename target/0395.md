Chapter 395: Untitled

After dawn.

Chu Xiaoye's team still occupied this territory and had no intention of leaving.

Furthermore, they were preparing to hunt again.

Chu Xiaoye left with Catherine, Mei Mei, Little Curly Tail, Molly, and the others. Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers left from another direction.

In the pride's camp, other than the female lions, there were also a few lions. They seemed to be in sufficient numbers to protect themselves.

If this formation was placed on the grassland, few enemies would dare to provoke it.

Although the sun could not shine on the ground, it also restored some light to the dark forest.

The cold father lay on the grass and narrowed his eyes. He looked sleepy, but his ears were pricked up and he listened warily to the wind and grass around him.

The Chino brothers lay at the side, not daring to go too far.

The female lions gathered and guarded each other's backs.

The two young cubs, the three warthogs, and Little Mi were still sleeping in the cave.

The cute violent bear and her son seemed to never be full. In the bushes not far away, they chewed the lush green plant stalks with relish.

The leopard family of four disappeared.

Until noon, Chu Xiaoye and the two teams with blue eyes had yet to return.

At this moment, the cold father really fell asleep. He closed his eyes and lowered his head.

The female lions were also sleepy.

The little girl sat in the pride and felt her back ache.

She stood up and walked on the grass, jumping a few times. Then, she walked behind the big tree and looked around. She undid the belt at her waist and prepared to relieve herself.

The bushes behind him suddenly swayed and returned to calm.

The little girl squatted down and slowly pulled out the sharp knife. The snow-white blade reflected the bushes behind her.

A strand of golden fur was vaguely visible in the bushes.

The little girl was stunned for a moment. She widened her eyes and continued to look, thinking that she had seen wrong.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a shadow suddenly fell from above. A strong wind whistled and killing intent assaulted his face\!

The little girl suddenly looked up and saw a ferocious face and a bloody mouth instantly pouncing down\!

At this moment, the little girl widened her eyes and did not have the time to react.

Right at this moment, the bushes behind him suddenly moved and a figure rushed out at lightning speed. With a bang, it hit the shadow heavily\!

The ferocious tiger, who had been hiding on the tree for a long time, finally found an opportunity to attack and torture her. It was caught off guard and was hit hard against the thick tree trunk of this tree. It fell to the ground in a sorry state and landed in front of the little girl.

"Whoosh\!"

Before it could jump up, a cold light flashed and a sharp knife suddenly pierced into its eyes\!

"Roar—"

A miserable scream suddenly sounded in the forest.

The little girl rolled away and immediately rolled into the distance. She got up and ran towards the pride, not even having the time to retract the knife that was cutting the beef.

She looked back and saw that the terrifying beast had already jumped up, but it was stopped by a familiar figure.

"Bad king, it's really you\!"

It turned out that the bad fellow hiding in the bushes at the back and peeping was really a king.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, Molly, and the blue-eyed mixed fur, who were supposed to be hunting outside, actually jumped out of the bushes not far away and pounced at the tiger.

There was still the sharp knife stuck in one of the tiger's eyes. He was trembling in pain and exceptionally furious\!

It roared angrily and pounced crazily at the young lion blocking the way.

Chu Xiaoye easily dodged it. The moment it passed by, he suddenly grabbed its side and almost cut open its entire stomach\!

The tiger landed on the ground, its face covered in blood. A deep wound appeared on its abdomen, and its bright red internal organs could almost be seen.

It was shocked, angry, in pain, and afraid. It wanted to turn around and escape, but it realized that it had long been surrounded by the pride.

It turned around and looked behind it. It wanted to use its speed and strength to forcefully break out of the encirclement, but it realized that its eyes were in unbearable pain and its entire body could not help but tremble. As long as it moved, its eyeballs would hurt even more and its head would become a little dizzy.

This slash not only pierced its eyes, it also injured its head.

"Roar—"

It could not wait for death. It suddenly roared and rushed towards the younger lions, preparing to break out of the encirclement\!

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine immediately had grave expressions and were ready for battle.

They had seen such a ferocious beast and were still traumatized\!

The strength, cunning and cruelty of this ferocious beast were things they would never forget in their lives\!

The furious ferocious beast was exceptionally fierce and terrifying\!

However, to their surprise, the terrifying ferocious beast had just run for a distance when it suddenly fell to the ground with a bang. After rolling a few times on the grass in a sorry state, it stopped.

It let out a miserable and desperate roar and swung its limbs, as if it wanted to get the knife that had pierced into its eye sockets out, but it seemed to have no strength.

At this moment, this forest king only felt pain in its eyes, its head was dizzy, and its vision swayed. All the strength in its body disappeared and it could not tell the direction.

He had lived in the forest for so many years and experienced all sorts of cruel battles and competitions. He had also suffered many injuries, but he had never been so terrified and helpless like now.

Even if an eyeball was dug out, even if there was a big hole on its body, or even if it was missing a leg, it could grit its teeth and run and fight.

But now, that small thing had pierced into its eyes, causing it to lose all its strength and hope.

The culprit was actually the weakest-looking strange little thing that was not a threat to it at all\!

It was unwilling to accept this.

His head hurt more and more, his vision turned darker and his consciousness became more and more blurry.

Finally, it opened its mouth and turned around to lie on the ground. Its limbs were stiff and it widened its remaining eye. It was dead\!

Not to mention the other members of the pride being shocked and in disbelief, even Chu Xiaoye did not expect this outcome.

Little Curly Tail and the others, who had been preparing to fight with all their might, watched this scene in a daze. For a moment, they could not react.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the tiger. In order to prevent this ferocious beast from playing tricks and coming back to life, he suddenly slapped the tiger's head and shattered its skull.

Blood flowed out of the tiger's eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. Its ferocious appearance looked even more ferocious and terrifying.

Chu Xiaoye used his claws to take out the dagger-like knife. It was inserted very deeply and almost pierced the handle.

It was not that the little girl was strong enough, but this knife was too sharp.

This cruel attacker finally died and Callie's revenge was taken.

However, everyone only heaved a sigh of relief. No one felt happy or relaxed.

Because no one knew how many more such ferocious beasts they would encounter in front and in the future.

He had lost a companion just a few days ago. His future would probably be even more miserable.

The most important thing now was to find a new territory and a new home quickly. Only then would there be life and hope.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

The tiger's corpse was still lying on the grass.

The strong smell of blood soon attracted other carnivores.

A black bear observed carefully in the forest and ran over quickly.

Just as it was about to eat heartily, a group of gray wolves ran out of the forest and looked at it coldly.

The black bear seemed to be unwilling to accept this. It stood up and let out a threatening roar, revealing its sharp fangs, wanting to scare away this group of hungry wolves.

However, wolves were not easy to bully.

They approached step by step with their proficiency.

Just as an intense battle was about to erupt between the two sides, a strong figure covered in patterns suddenly walked out from the forest beside them.

It was another tiger\!

This tiger was even larger. It seemed to ignore the strong killing intent and nervous atmosphere in front of it. It slowly walked towards the corpse of its own kind.

The black bear standing close immediately put down its front feet and landed on all fours. It no longer looked fierce like before and turned to run.

The ten-over gray wolves did not continue to be stubborn and turned to retreat.

It seemed that they all knew this forest king that just appeared.

A roar sounded in the ancient forest, as if it was filled with sorrow.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team through the dark and humid forest and followed the path opened by the sea to the brand new lake.

The lake had already formed, but the water was very muddy. It carried sand and all sorts of vegetation, looking like a pool of mud.

This was not a good place to open up a home. He had to cross the mountain in front of him and stay further away from this fearless seawater to be safe.

Lions were not used to walking on the mountain path, but as they walked, it was as if they were walking on flat ground.

However, the human girl could not.

Although she was wearing a gazelle skin and stepping on small leather shoes, like a light and agile little animal, her endurance was really not good. After walking for a while, she was sweating and panting.

However, perhaps because she was afraid of being a burden to the pride or because she was afraid of being looked down on and disliked by the pride, she did not stop to rest or shout that she was tired.

She fell to the ground and got up herself, not saying a word.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at her and ignored her.

He would not wait for his team members who could not keep up.

He had the responsibility of the pride and would not implicate the pride for that bit of humanity that he should not have.

The little girl fell to the ground again and almost lost her strength.

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and gloated. He ran back and forth, urging everyone to leave and ignore that little thing.

Without that little thing, his brother's love for him would definitely return.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, Chu Xiaoye turned around and slapped him. He looked at him coldly and told him to be quiet and not run around. He was annoyed.

Don't you see that everyone is exhausted? You're still running around energetically\! You're provoking everyone's anger, do you know that?

"Stop and rest."

Chu Xiaoye growled and stopped.

Everyone was tired. They should rest for a while.

Little Curly Tail turned around and realized that everyone was as energetic as him. No one was exhausted.

Therefore, he felt very wronged.
