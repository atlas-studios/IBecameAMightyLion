Chapter 127: The Lion and Tiger Battle\!

I make the decisions regarding my food.

Today.

Chu Xiaoye finally understood something.

In this grassland, the coldness, dominance, decisiveness, and cruelty a lion should have could not be easily abandoned at any time.

Sometimes.

Many problems could be resolved with a lion's roar or a slap.

Wasn't the former cold father and his eldest brother, Lars, like this?

Now, it seemed that they were the true lions on the grassland.

As for him, he was just a childish minor who had a human soul and was indecisive and cautious.

He had to continue learning.

After the pride left, the camp returned to calm.

Qiqi and Nunu were rudely stuffed into the hole by Chu Xiaoye with his claws and threatened fiercely with his roars to make them sleep obediently.

The two little fellows immediately obediently hid in the hole and shivered.

After covering the hole with leaves.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes at the back and checked the disguise on the trap again.

It was not perfect, but it was difficult to discover any abnormalities.

This time, to prevent the tiger from escaping again, Chu Xiaoye hid on a big tree at the front.

He decided to personally be the barrier that blocked its retreat\!

As long as that tiger appeared again, he would never let it escape again\!

The conflict in the pride, the decreasing food on the tree and his rapid increase in appetite forced him to end the battle quickly and find his own world.

The night was very quiet.

There were no sounds of insects in the huge bushes.

Even during a dry season, it would not be like this.

The situation was a little strange.

Chu Xiaoye held his breath and stared at the bushes below with his dark eyes.

Seconds and minutes passed.

The night quietly passed.

However, there was no movement in the forest.

It was another night without any gains.

Just as he relaxed his vigilance and was about to move his stiff neck, the cry of the warthog suddenly came from the Baobab tree in the pride's camp\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before his heart suddenly trembled. He hurriedly jumped down the tree\!

He had forgotten another possibility\!

That extremely intelligent tiger could completely avoid passing through this forest and circle around the grassland directly. It could still reach the pride's camp\!

If Qiqi and Nunu were disobedient and sneaked out of the hole to play outside, the consequences would be unimaginable\!

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye dashed towards the camp like the night wind\!

Although Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei did not know what was happening, they hurriedly followed behind him.

As for Catherine, she still blended into the night and did not move.

On the Baobab tree, the warthog was still roaring\!

When Chu Xiaoye rushed out of the bushes, he saw the colorful tiger digging the hole on the grass with its claws\!

The leaves that covered the hole had long been pushed to the side.

Qiqi and Nunu cowered in the depths of the hole, baring their fangs in fear and trembling violently.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and pounced forward like lightning\!

This time, the tiger did not escape immediately. Instead, it raised its head and looked at him coldly. It immediately rushed over as well\!

Its dark and cold eyes were filled with human-like hatred\!

It wanted to kill this group of little things and not leave a single one alive\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also roared angrily and pounced forward bravely\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped up, raised his right claw, and slapped the tiger hard\!

As for the tiger, it suddenly raised its upper body and swung its huge and thick claws\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately felt a huge force coming from his right claw\!

He was in midair and could not help but fly to the side, landing heavily on the ground.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also pounced on him from the left and right\!

Unexpectedly, this tiger suddenly turned around and its thick tail was like an iron whip that slapped them viciously\!

Mei Mei was sent flying.

While Little Curly Tail was flying, he suddenly swung his curled tail and instantly wrapped it around the tiger's tail\!

Using the strength of his tail, he suddenly exerted strength and pounced at the tiger's butt\!

The tiger was clearly frightened. It hurriedly turned around and wanted to pounce on him and bite him\!

However, its tail swing also brought Little Curly Tail behind him.

Little Curly Tail took this opportunity to open his mouth and bite the beast fiercely, not caring if its butt was smelly or not\!

No matter how smelly it was, could it be more smelly than his brother's fart?

He was not afraid\!

"Roar —"

A tiger's butt could not be touched or bitten\!

Little Curly Tail's bite immediately bit the tiger until it jumped three feet high. Its butt suddenly trembled and it stood upright and sat heavily on the ground\!

With its huge body, terrifying weight, and ferocious falling momentum, if Little Curly Tail was sat on, he would be crippled even if he did not die\!

At this critical moment, Little Curly Tail could only release his teeth and tail and hurriedly fall to the ground to get lost\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye and Mei Mei had already pounced forward again\!

Just as the tiger landed, Chu Xiaoye jumped onto its back and bit its spine\!

Two rows of sharp teeth fiercely closed\!

Mei Mei pounced at its abdomen and bit it\!

"Bang\!"

However, before she could close her teeth, a huge claw slapped her head\!

She was very fast, but the other party was even faster\!

Mei Mei was sent flying again.

This time, she struggled on the ground a few times and was actually dizzy. She could not get up for a long time\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye had already bitten the tiger's spine\!

"Roar —"

The intense pain made the tiger exceptionally furious\!

It suddenly jumped up and moved its body crazily, wanting to push Chu Xiaoye down\!

Chu Xiaoye's two front limbs no longer had sharp claws. He could only rely on the sharp claws of his hind legs and the lock of his two rows of teeth. He was instantly swayed by the shaking of the tiger-like duckweed in the wind\!

Be it his limbs or teeth, they could not use more strength\!

"Whoosh—"

Little Curly Tail rushed up again and bit the tiger's hind leg\!

To his surprise, this tiger was extremely strong. It suddenly raised its hind legs and sent him flying\!

At the same time, it quickly pulled out its thick tail and slapped Little Curly Tail's head heavily\!

Little Curly Tail fell into the grass. He was dizzy and his mind was blank.

Before he could get up, the tiger suddenly brought Chu Xiaoye and ran crazily into the bushes at the back of the camp\!

The pain on its spine made it roar continuously in anger\!

Obviously, it wanted to use the bushes and trees to remove the threat on its back\!

"Whoosh\!"

It rushed into a bush full of thorns and rolled on the ground\!

Countless thorns pierced into Chu Xiaoye's body. The weight of this tiger also suffocated him, but he still bit its spine tightly and refused to let go\!

"Roar —"

The tiger suddenly got up and ran crazily towards a big tree. Then, it suddenly jumped up, turned around, and aimed its back at the hard tree trunk, slamming it hard\!

This time, if Chu Xiaoye did not let go, his bones would definitely be crushed and he would die on the spot\!
