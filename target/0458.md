Chapter 458: Untitled

The black fog dispersed.

The saber-toothed tiger slowly got up from the ground and stood in place in a daze, like a defeated warrior. Its eyes were lifeless and its face was filled with frustration. It was also like a pitiful worm that had already lost all hope because of a smelly fart, stunned and dejected.

The little lion in front of him had long disappeared.

"Roar\!"

After a long time, a roar resounded throughout the grassland\!

The saber-toothed tiger widened its eyes in anger, its face distorted, and its entire body trembled.

"If I don't take revenge, I swear not to be a tiger\! If I don't repay this humiliation, I'll never mate\!"

Just as the saber-toothed tiger was secretly swearing a venomous oath, Chu Xiaoye had already returned the way he came and stopped Catherine and Alisa, who were chasing after him quickly.

The two female lions were already panting from exhaustion. After hearing the terrifying roars of the saber-toothed tiger, they thought that his situation was definitely very critical, and his life was even in danger. Unexpectedly, he actually ran back alone and seemed to be safe.

"Where's that big fellow?"

Alisa panted as she looked at him in disbelief.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and grinned. "He's eating farts."

He could not stay here for long\!

After the two female lions rested for a while, Chu Xiaoye immediately brought them back to the camp.

After vomiting a few times, the saber-toothed tiger's body should have become extremely weak. Even if it wanted to chase after him, it probably did not have the strength.

When Chu Xiaoye left this territory with Alisa and Catherine, the saber-toothed tiger returned dejectedly.

The only surviving ferocious tiger went up with a fawning expression, but was slapped away.

The saber-toothed tiger was in a bad mood.

At the same time, in the camp of the cold father's pride, in the cave at the bottom of the super huge tree, the members of the pride were resting after eating and drinking their fill.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others lay at the entrance of the cave outside. They narrowed their eyes and dozed off, protecting silently.

Everything was dark.

The dim moonlight was blocked by the dense leaves on this super huge tree. Even the surrounding bushes were exceptionally dark and gloomy.

In the tree hole above, the human girl was sleeping on her soft fur.

On the tree hole, on the thick trunk of the super huge tree, a figure with antennas like a python climbed down silently through the thick mucus.

It twisted its body and slowly climbed to the root.

When it sensed a trace of movement, it suddenly stopped there and did not move. After a long time, it continued to climb down. Then, it crawled into the tree hole where the little girl was sleeping with ease.

It stopped at the entrance of the cave and gently swayed the two antennas on its head, as if it was smelling something or listening to the surroundings.

Below, other than the snores of the cold father and the big black bear, there was no other sound.

Hence, it continued forward, winding and silent. Soon, it arrived beside the little girl.

Smelling the aura emitted by the little girl, it seemed to be excited. It suddenly became faster and immediately wrapped around the little girl's feet. Then, it followed her feet and continued to wrap up.

Right at this moment, a sound came from below the tree hole.

It immediately froze there and did not move.

Little Curly Tail returned with Mei Mei and Molly.

The three of them were injured, especially Molly. Although her wounds no longer bled and healed very quickly under Chu Xiaoye's treatment, under the anxious journey just now, the tearing was extremely painful.

As soon as she returned, she climbed up the tree and crawled into her tree hole to rest.

Mei Mei walked in front of her mother and rubbed her head, telling her that she was fine and that she had only suffered a small injury.

Little Curly Tail stood there and looked out from time to time. He looked very anxious, as if he wanted to go out.

Aisha saw that he was injured and did not see Chu Xiaoye return. She immediately walked over, rubbed his neck, licked the wounds on his body, and asked him about the situation.

The cold father also woke up from his sleep and looked at him solemnly.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers walked over and asked with worried expressions.

They had all returned and were injured. They had gone out to find their king but did not return. They must have encountered danger outside. Logically speaking, with the king's strength and the two female lions following, he should be fine.

However, Little Curly Tail looked extremely anxious and worried. Clearly, the enemy was definitely unexpectedly strong.

The Jerry brothers, who were loyal to Chu Xiaoye, could not help but growl at Little Curly Tail. They wanted him to lead the way and help them.

However, Little Curly Tail only looked at the brothers and had no intention of moving.

He knew how terrifying that ferocious beast was. If these members went, they would definitely die and become his brother's burden. At this moment, he could only rely on his brother to survive.

Although he was very worried about his brother, he believed that his brother would definitely return alive.

Mei Mei also walked over, signaling everyone not to worry. Her brother would be back soon.

To her, her brother would always be the strongest. Any enemy could forget about taking advantage of her brother\! Other thanâ€¦ those shameless female lions and female leopards.

Of course, he could not blame his brother. Any male had the instinct and responsibility to mate.

His brother was a lion, and a powerful lion king at that. It was natural even if he had a large harem beside him.

Little Curly Tail was a little dispirited. He did not know if it was because he was injured or because he was worried about his brother. Or perhaps, he felt that he did not have the ability to help his brother. He was sad.

He jumped onto the thick tree root and climbed up the tree hole where Molly lived.

When he entered the tree hole, he could not help but look at the tree hole on his brother's side, but he was stunned. Although this place was extremely dark and gloomy, to a lion, he could see everything here clearly.

On his brother's tree hole, there was actually something that looked like a vine hanging. It was full of green leaves that were curved and stuck into his brother's tree hole.

Little Curly Tail stood there and looked at the thick and green plant in a daze. He thought in confusion, This thing did not seem to exist here previously, right? Did it just grow? However, why did it grow so quickly? Or could it be that it already existed and his brother liked this thing, but he had not noticed it previously?

Who cares? It's just a plant.

Little Curly Tail looked down and ignored her. He crawled into the tree hole and walked to Molly's side.

Molly opened her eyes keenly and looked at him vigilantly and suspiciously. She wanted to get up, but he pressed her head down and pressed her to the ground.

Little Curly Tail looked at her coldly and ordered her to continue closing her eyes to sleep and ignore him.

Molly blinked and could only obediently close her eyes.

Little Curly Tail stared at her face in a daze, but he was thinking about his brother and praying that he would return safely.

At this moment, the thing that looked like a vine started to squirm silently again. It started from above and slowly extended into the tree hole.

The little girl in the tree hole had her legs wrapped.
