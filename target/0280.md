Chapter 280: The Lioness' Performance

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws and collided heavily with the black lion's claws.

A huge force suddenly attacked\!

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled and he took a few steps back with a whoosh. He felt his feet go numb.

The black lion had just landed on the ground when it pounced forward again. Its ferocious and ferocious face was like a demon in the night.

His movements were silent but exceptionally fierce.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and went forward.

The other party did not dare to roar. He was different. This was his territory\!

A loud roar spread in the quiet night and instantly spread throughout the entire territory.

The female lion at the side was shocked. She hesitated for a moment and immediately turned around to run into the territory.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her back and was a little surprised.

This female lion had already been exposed. Why did she not flee into the distance but return to her territory and pride?

Perhaps, she thought that her strong lover could kill him and silence the king\!

Chu Xiaoye remembered her appearance.

This lioness that had betrayed the pride, his race, and him could not be left alive\!

"Bang\!"

The black lion was extremely strong.

He was sent flying again and fell to the ground in a sorry state.

He rolled up but did not show his golden claws. He still looked angry, but he was a little weak.

The longer it dragged on, the slimmer the chances of this lion leaving would be.

In his territory, he was least afraid of spending time with the other party.

This was a very powerful black lion, and the shining crystal whisker at the corner of its mouth was the symbol of his strength.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this black lion was the same as him and did not show its true strength.

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and took the initiative to charge up.

However, this black lion was extremely decisive. When he roared, it had the intention to retreat.

In just a few minutes of fighting, Yu Ning knew that she could not kill him in a short time. The longer she delayed, the more dangerous it would be.

As for the exposed lioness lion, she had already become a useless abandoned son to this black lion.

At this moment, when Chu Xiaoye roared a second time and took the initiative to charge forward, the black lion immediately turned around and fled without hesitation.

At the same time.

Not far away, a few figures ran over quickly.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye would not let him go back and immediately chased after him.

Although the black lion was huge, its running speed was still astonishing.

"Pfft—"

A black stream of air suddenly spewed out from behind Chu Xiaoye\!

Then, his speed suddenly increased, and he instantly exceeded the black lion, blocking him.

At the same time, a stench filled the air.

The black lion sniffed and immediately held its breath as it pounced at him.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye finally revealed his golden claws and suddenly grabbed at the black lion's head.

At the same time, another stream of air sprayed out from behind him. He actually instantly dodged the black lion's pounce and rushed past him.

The sharp golden claws slid down the black lion's neck and across his back\!

Sparks flickered and illuminated the ferocious face of the black lion\!

Chu Xiaoye's invincible golden claws did not penetrate the flesh on the black lion's back. They only cut off a few strands of his mane and the sparse black fur on his back\!

At the same time, a few silver scratches appeared on the black lion's back.

"Roar—"

The black lion turned around and let out its first roar. It pounced at him angrily.

The lion's mane was not to be violated\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye used his speed to dodge his pounce again. At the same time, his sharp golden claw grabbed his other back.

Similarly, a series of sparks lit up. Only fur fell and no blood splashed.

The skin on this black lion was even more tenacious than the armor on the one-eyed lion king. Even his golden claws could not pierce through it\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, and Tilly rushed over and quickly surrounded this strong black lion.

They knew that a lion that could make their brother roar for help was definitely terrifyingly strong\!

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine immediately rushed towards the black lion, and her claws that were flickering with silver light slashed viciously at the black lion's abdomen\!

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, the black lion only swung its tail and sent Catherine flying.

Catherine fell to the grass in a sorry state and quickly got up.

Little Curly Tail looked at the black lion's tail and his eyes immediately lit up. He immediately swung his tail and pounced on it.

"Bam\!"

When the black lion's tail slapped him fiercely, Little Curly Tail immediately straightened his tail and slapped him.

A crisp sound\!

The two tails collided heavily\!

Before the black lion's tail could separate, Little Curly Tail's tail instantly wrapped around the black lion's tail like a snake and tightly wrapped around the root of his tail\!

The black lion was shocked. It hurriedly twisted its butt and wanted to pull its tail out, but it saw Little Curly Tail suddenly swing his tail. The black lion's huge body was actually sent flying\!

"Bang\!"

The black lion fell heavily to the ground.

At this moment, Tilly and Mei Mei had already rushed up.

Tilly grabbed the black lion's head, and Mei Mei grabbed the black lion's butt\!

However, it was useless.

The black lion's head and butt were still intact\!

Their sharp claws only left a few silver-white marks on them.

"Bang\!"

The black lion suddenly jumped up and slapped Tilly's head, but she blocked it with her claws.

Tilly was sent flying, but she landed steadily on the ground.

The black lion roared angrily and pounced at Mei Mei again.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Little Curly Tail's tail flew over again and instantly wrapped around his hind leg. He suddenly pulled and pulled him to the ground.

Before the black lion could stand up again, Chu Xiaoye had already flown over. With a whoosh, the golden claws pierced into his eyes\!

He had armor on him but not in his eyes\!

"Roar—"

A miserable scream suddenly came from the black lion's mouth.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly pulled with his claws and actually tore off half of his face from the inside out\!

A sharp pain assaulted the black lion's entire head\!

Just as he jumped up and was about to risk his life, Little Curly Tail swung his tail again. He raised his hind legs and fell to the ground again.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine took this opportunity to pounce on him. Her silver claws flashed with a cold light and pierced ruthlessly into his abdomen. Then, with a whoosh, she opened his entire abdomen\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up, raised his claws, and slapped the black lion's head heavily\!

The black lion, who was suffering the pain of its abdomen being broken, had just opened its mouth and was about to scream when its skull was smashed and it let out a roar\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to be careless. He raised his claws again and slapped him again.

As for Little Curly Tail, he suddenly swung his tail and threw the black lion's corpse into the air. He started to circle around and run around.

Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, Mei Mei, and Tilly immediately fled when they saw this scene.

Blood and internal organs fell like rain.

Little Curly Tail was covered in blood and still wagged his tail excitedly. He swung his black lion and ran around torturing corpses.

He only stopped when he was panting from exhaustion.

The black lion's corpse fell to the ground with its mouth open and eyes wide. It looked rather ferocious, but its abdomen was empty and it looked extremely miserable.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the side and looked at the black lion with lingering fear.

If Little Curly Tail and the others had not rushed over, he might not have been able to keep this black lion.

No matter how fast he was or how sharp his golden claws were, he could not hurt this black lion.

The flesh on this black lion was terrifyingly tough.

He walked close and extended his claws to push aside the black lion's fur. He stared at the black skin for a while before using his sharp claws to try slashing a few times. It was still as tough as iron and could not be pierced at all. He did not know what material formed it.

He suddenly had a thought. If he peeled off the leather armor of this black lion and wore it in his abdomen or protected his butt, wouldn't he no longer have to be afraid of Catherine, the Ripper, and the hyenas digging out gan beasts?

"Roar\!"

He growled and let Little Curly Tail bring the black lion's corpse away.

The matter was not completely resolved.

The lioness fled back to the camp. He had to find her and kill her completely to prevent her from bringing the news out or inciting the other lionesses to rebel.

Little Curly Tail wrapped his tail around the black lion's neck and dragged him behind.

Chu Xiaoye walked straight towards the territory of the Jerry brothers.

These two brothers were loyal to him and would definitely not be traitors or protect the female lion.

If that lioness was really hiding there, they would definitely be able to find her.

When Chu Xiaoye returned with Little Curly Tail and the others, the cold father arrived with the four female lions and Molly.

They also heard Chu Xiaoye's roar, but they were not as fast as Little Curly Tail and the others.

When they saw the black lion dragged behind Little Curly Tail, they were shocked. They did not have the time to ask and immediately followed behind.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride of the cold father and walked towards the territory of the Jerry brothers.

Soon, they arrived at the border.

The Jerry brothers were patrolling loyally. When they saw this young king coming with a pride full of killing intent, they were shocked.

Chu Xiaoye came in front of them and growled, asking them to gather every member of this territory.

The Jerry brothers did not dare to ask more. They looked at the black lion's corpse and immediately turned around to roar at the territory.

The roars of the two brothers spread throughout the entire territory.

Before long, groups of lions and female lions arrived one after another.

There were a total of 74 members in this territory, including the newly assigned wandering lions over the past few days.

At this moment, they stood in front of the Jerry brothers neatly and looked at the brothers suspiciously and nervously, then at the pride of the cold father and the young king.

They did not know what was happening.

Chu Xiaoye looked around for a while and realized that the numbers were wrong. There were still five members missing.

The female lion was not among them.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the miserable and furious roar of a female lion suddenly came from the bushes not far away.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed over like lightning.

The other members immediately followed behind and ran over.

When Chu Xiaoye rushed into the bushes, he realized that the traitor lioness was squatting under a big tree with tears in her eyes and roaring miserably.

On the grass beside her lay four young cubs. The youngest was only four to five months old.

The four young cubs were dripping with blood and had already stopped breathing. Their hazy eyes were filled with fear.

"Roar—"

When the other members rushed over, this lioness suddenly bared her fangs and roared at Chu Xiaoye angrily, her eyes filled with hatred and anger.

"Murderer\! Murderer\! He's the murderer\!"

The female lions trembled all over and their roars were filled with hatred.

When the Jerry brothers and the other members saw this scene, they were stunned in place and looked at their young king in shock.

They were all simple-minded animals. Who would think of a scheme?

Chu Xiaoye was surprised by this lioness's schemes and intelligence.

However, no matter how powerful a scheme she had and how intelligent she was, she could not do anything in front of him.

"Why should I kill them? There has to be at least one reason, right?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the corpses of the four young cubs with a cold gaze and then at the cunning female lion.

The female lion bared her fangs and let out a hoarse roar.

Why did a lion kill a cub?

Any animal knew\!

The reason why he cruelly killed the cubs was naturally to force the cub's mother to go into heat again and mate with him\!

"Roar—"

The lionesses' roars were filled with endless hatred and anger.

His acting was really good\!

Chu Xiaoye was secretly shocked.

However, as a dignified lion king, did he need to mate in this way?

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly rushed out from behind him and rushed in front of the female lion. With a bang, he suddenly slapped the female lion's mouth\!

The female lion's bared fangs were actually sent flying with a crack and she fell to the ground in a sorry state, her mouth full of blood.

Catherine stood in front of her with a cold gaze and her entire body trembling.

This was the first time Chu Xiaoye had seen this female cub tremble in anger. It seemed that this girl's feelings and protection for him were deeper than he had imagined.

However, he did not understand Catherine's anger.

She felt that it was an insult to the king's eyes to look at such an ugly and old vegetable skin\!

However, this shameless old thing actually accused her king of killing her child in order to mate with her. This was more painful and humiliating than killing Catherine\!

Her king did not even fancy her and even the noble and beautiful little white lion. Why would he fancy an old vegetable like her?

Damn it\!

She wanted to cut open this shameless thing's stomach and tear it into pieces\!

"Roar—"

The female lion got up from the ground and roared angrily with her mouth full of blood. She looked at her with hatred, then looked at Chu Xiaoye.

"You killed my child. Now, are you preparing to kill me too? Young king, won't your treatment of your followers make the other followers feel disappointed?"

"Bang\!"

Catherine rushed up again and slapped her again, sending her other fangs flying.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at the pride behind him and did not explain anything. Instead, he let Little Curly Tail drag the black lion over and let everyone smell the scent on this black lion. Then, they would smell the female lion.

After lingering for so long, he did not believe that this lioness did not smell like a black lion.

As for the four cruelly killed cubs, clearly, they only had the scent of the female lion on them and not his scent.

To play dirty in front of him, she had to at least be smarter than him.

However, clearly, this lioness's intelligence was pitifully low to him. Otherwise, she would not have dared to return after being exposed.

Taking a step back, even if she said everything, even if what she said was true.

So what?

He could still slap her to death.

The world of animals did not rely on performance, but on strength.

Even if you were wrong, as long as you were strong, you were right.
