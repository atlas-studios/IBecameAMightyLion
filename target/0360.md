Chapter 360: Untitled

The battle was about to start\!

Under the hyena queen's command, the fifty strong hyenas started to split up and surround the pride, roaring and running around.

When hyenas fought lions, they never faced them head-on.

Creating chaos, causing panic, and taking advantage of their carelessness to exhaust and attack them one after another was the combat technique they had always been proud of.

Furthermore, they saw through the pride's weakness at a glance.

Blue eyes, mixed fur, and the Jerry brothers were all tall and strong. They were not to be trifled with at a glance. However, the lions behind them were either short or weak in aura. Furthermore, they looked very nervous and were clearly foreign lions.

Therefore, most of the hyenas ran to the back and wandered. As they threatened with noisy cries, their dark and cold eyes flickered, looking for an opportunity.

The cold father was indeed a little guilty.

Aisha, Xi'er, Maya, Callie, and Molly were all feeling guilty.

This was the first time he had seen such a huge and strong hyena, and there were many of them. It was impossible for him to not be nervous.

Even Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail were a little nervous.

The hyenas were different from other carnivores. With their sharp fangs and strong bite strength, as long as you took a bite, your bones would be separated, and even your bones would be broken. Furthermore, there were many bacteria.

The former black lion clearly paled in comparison to these spotted hyenas and was not worth mentioning.

Little Curly Tail swayed his tail gently, bared his fangs, and let out a fierce growl to hide his nervousness.

He stood beside his mother and twisted his head, looking at the spotted hyenas behind him with a fierce gaze.

He was not afraid. However, before figuring out the other party's true strength, he was a little worried. After all, his mother and the other lionesses looked dangerous with their size and strength.

Mei Mei stood with her mother, her blue eyes flickering with a cold chill.

Everyone was puzzled.

Usually, at this moment, Chu Xiaoye could not help but be the first to rush out.

With his speed and strength, he would have long sacrificed the first spotted hyena or the hyena queen. Why was he still not moving?

Everyone looked over in confusion.

Chu Xiaoye twisted his head, his gaze flickering. His body slowly spun and finally, his gaze was fixed on the bushes behind him.

A few smaller hyenas took advantage of the chaos and crawled into the bushes.

The hyena queen also ran in.

They tacitly ran towards the tree.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light. He clearly saw sharp claws spring out from under the feet of the spotted hyenas and the hyena queen.

They knew how to climb trees\!

On the tree, the little girl, Qiqi, and Nunu were hiding.

Obviously, the hyena queen with a sharp sense of smell and extraordinary intelligence had long discovered the greatest weakness of their pride.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and rushed back under the tree. Then, he growled and ordered Tilly, Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei.

The first thing they had to deal with was naturally the hyena queen who could climb trees and the few smaller hyenas.

Chu Xiaoye took the initiative to attack and rushed towards the hyena queen first.

Tilly, Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei each had a goal. With a whoosh, they rushed towards the smaller hyenas like lightning\!

Blue Eyes and the other members of the pride of the cold father retreated under the tree and stood in a circle. Their butts faced each other. They defended each other and did not move.

Although the hyenas were strong and fierce, under the huge bodies and auras of Blue Eyes and the others, they only dared to roar and run around to scare them. They did not dare to take the initiative to seek death.

They could no longer receive the hyena queen's orders.

Because at this moment, the strongest hyena queen was fighting Chu Xiaoye intensely\!

Chu Xiaoye was very fast and his golden claws were very sharp, but every time he attacked, the hyena queen would cleverly and agilely dodge him.

The hyena queen did not attack. She only dodged left and right and retreated continuously. Although she looked a little sorry, she was calm and at ease.

It did not spend as much energy as Chu Xiaoye.

This combat technique was very similar to the technique Chu Xiaoye used when he encountered a strong enemy previously.

He would first expend the other party's strength and fighting spirit. Once the other party showed signs of fatigue, his movements would be slightly slower, and he would suddenly attack and kill the other party with one move\!

However, it did not know that it had used this combat technique on the wrong target.

Chu Xiaoye's stamina was not so easily exhausted.

Its retreat made Chu Xiaoye's attacks even more ferocious and fast. His sharp golden claws flickered with a cold light under the moonlight. He brushed past it a few times, scaring it into a cold sweat.

At this moment, it had lost the initiative and retreated again and again. It could only retreat continuously. Even if it wanted to attack, it was already too late.

Chu Xiaoye did not give it any chance to counterattack, let alone give it a chance to order its subordinates again.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Golden light flickered and his fur fluttered\!

Chu Xiaoye turned into a series of afterimages and pressed forward. Every claw made the hyena queen dodge with all her might. Every attack made the other party more and more terrified\!

The fur on the hyena queen's body started to fall off and scatter.

"Chi\!"

Finally, she was only a little slower than before when a deep wound was immediately scratched on her face. If it had not turned around in time, her entire face would have been scratched off\!

The hyena queen, who had originally wanted to use her agile movement technique to drain the other party's strength, was panting and exhausted at this moment. She did not even have the chance to roar or breathe\!

The blood on its face blurred its vision.

Its heart became more and more terrified.

It was so strong, so agile, and so fast. Its fangs were sharp and its claws were like hooks under its feet. Ever since its evolution, its strength had increased greatly. It was not afraid even when facing an adult lion.

But now, he was in such a sorry state that he did not even have the chance to retaliate\!

"Chi\!"

In its fear and panic, it slowed down again. Chu Xiaoye's claws grabbed its head and tore off half of its scalp\!

An intense pain assaulted him and his vision suddenly turned black\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Chu Xiaoye slapped its bloody head heavily and sent it flying, hitting a big tree behind it.

Before it could fall, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed close. He suddenly jumped up high. Golden claws fell from the sky and with a whoosh, he actually cut its head into two\!

At this moment, the few spotted hyenas that could climb trees had already been killed by Tilly and the others\!

The remaining hyenas saw that the young lions were so fierce and that their powerful hyena queen had already been defeated and died. They did not dare to stay and immediately fled.

"Roarâ€”"

Blue Eyes immediately roared angrily and chased after him with the pride.

The cold father brought the lionesses and followed behind. His courage increased and he let out the roar of a lion\!

Blue Eyes might have already understood that their king's troublesome battle was clearly to give this pride that had just arrived here a chance to fight personally and restore their confidence.

Otherwise, this powerful king only needed to roar to scare the spotted hyenas away\! Or he could kill them with a fart\!

After fighting side by side for this period of time, he knew how terrifying this young king was\!

The golden flag that was more dazzling than the sun was destined to float above this green grassland\!
