Chapter 426: Untitled

Alright.

In that case, he would compromise first.

The minority followed the majority.

Even the lion king had to respect everyone's opinion occasionally.

However, Chu Xiaoye still decided to ask for the opinion of this unfamiliar lion in front of him.

"Then, are you willing to submit to This King and join this pride?"

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes at it and raised his chin to express his intentions.

"I would rather die than submit\!"

The young and tall lion raised its head and stuck out its chest. Its eyes revealed its impassioned determination to die bravely, but it was secretly pleased.

The braver he was, the more the other party would value him and want to recruit him into the pride.

From the corner of his eye, he glanced at the sexy and strong female leopard and almost drooled again.

"Bang\!"

Just as he was letting his imagination run wild, Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and suddenly slapped his mouth, sending him flying\!

"You have a backbone\! Alright, I'll fulfill your wish\!"

Chu Xiaoye flicked his sharp claws and walked towards the unfamiliar lion with a murderous aura.

The young and tall lion fell heavily to the ground, his mouth full of blood and he was a little stunned.

When he saw this young lion king walk over with a murderous expression, he finally confirmed that he had overestimated the intelligence of this group of his own kind. The other party was still following the rules of the pride and was still that group of idiots\!

This was like a king against a bronze. The king thought that he was smart and calculated the other party's movement and release of skills. Unexpectedly, the other party did not move at all and stood foolishly in place.

Hence, the king's skills missed…

Damn it\!

It was too aggrieving\!

The young Zaha got up from the ground with his mouth full of blood. He looked angrily and coldly at the "stupid" bronze lion king in front of him and cursed in his heart, "Rookie\!"

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, and Molly over.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers also approached from the side, their eyes revealing killing intent.

Since they did not submit, they could die\!

Zaha narrowed his eyes and stood in place. He raised his head and stuck out his tongue to lick the blood at the corner of his mouth, looking like he was facing death calmly and looking down on the world.

"I would rather die than submit\!"

"Plop\!"

However, in the next second, he suddenly lay on the ground, lowered his noble head, and even turned around. He spread his legs and revealed his fragile stomach, sincerely indicating that he was willing to submit.

"I beg for mercy\!"

The trick of playing hard to get had failed. Then, he could only thicken his skin and surrender.

Anyway, he would be able to wash away this humiliation in a few days\!

At that time, not only would he burn this lion king to ashes, he would also kill all the lions. Then, he would completely occupy all the female lions in this pride and the sexy and strong female leopard\!

He, Zaha, wanted to rule the world and have a harem of three thousand lions\!

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was rolling on his stomach and begging for mercy, surrendering humbly, and scheming against this pride secretly, a silver light suddenly fell from the sky and went straight for his flipped stomach\!

Zaha was shocked. He hurriedly twisted his body and actually moved horizontally\!

Catherine's silver claw landed on the ground and grabbed into the soil, bringing with it a series of soil and grass fragments, leaving a few deep marks on the ground\!

Zaha jumped up from the ground and looked angrily and gloomily at the merciless female cub in front of him. If not for his extremely fast reaction, he would have been cut open by this female cub just now\!

Damn it\!

He had already surrendered and submitted. Why did they still want to kill him?

Didn't they just say that they wanted to accept lion talents?

He, Zaha, was a true genius among lions\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, an iron tail slapped over ferociously\!

Zaha was shocked and immediately jumped away to dodge. He let out an angry roar.

The iron tail slapped the ground heavily, causing a series of mud to spray on his body.

"Didn't you say you'd rather die than submit? Come on, let's hurt each other\!"

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and walked over, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.

Zaha was aggrieved and cursed the idiots. Didn't he just surrender? Did he already surrender? Could it be that none of you understood?

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail whipped him three more times. His attacks were very fierce and every move was fatal\!

As Zaha dodged, he roared angrily, indicating that he was willing to submit and surrender again. Furthermore, he roared for mercy in humiliation.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, Chu Xiaoye suddenly rushed in front of him and slapped him on the mouth again, sending one of his big teeth flying.

"Serves you right for not choosing to surrender immediately\! Kill him\!"

Chu Xiaoye ordered the pride.

Although everyone was a little stunned, they did not hesitate and immediately pounced forward.

Zaha fell heavily to the ground, blood flowing from his mouth. His vision was blurry and he was even more confused. Could it be that the rules of surrendering to the pride had changed?

Damn it…

"I surrender\! I surrender\!"

Seeing the lions bare their fangs and brandish their claws as they rushed over, he immediately panicked. He even forgot his goal of sneaking into the pride and only wanted to surrender and save his life.

He really wanted to surrender this time\!

No matter how powerful he was, he could not stop this group\!

He lay on the ground and rolled a few times. Then, he jumped up and twisted his butt with all his might. He wagged his tail and revealed the most fragile organ at the back, indicating that he was not a threat. He really wanted to surrender\!

Even a pig could see such an obvious surrender and submission.

Pit and the two warthogs not far away hurriedly snorted a few times and expressed to Chu Xiaoye, "King, this fellow has already surrendered. Look, his balls are showing\!"

Even the little girl riding on the big black bear said loudly, "King, they have already surrendered\!"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped the other party away again and roared angrily with a cold smile. "You would rather die than submit, right? You won't surrender even if you die, right? Good\! Very good\! This King will never force any hero to change sides\!"

"Roar—"

"I'm not a hero\! I'm a black bear\! I surrender\! I wasn't forced. I surrender willingly\! Spare me\!"

Zaha was slapped to the ground and cried miserably.

The big black bear not far away suddenly roared angrily, its eyes wide with anger. "I'm the black bear\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not give this lion any chance. He jumped up and pounced forward, killing it.

He did not have the hobby of raising lions\!

At this moment, Zaha finally understood. This young lion king had never thought of asking him to surrender. It had never thought of letting him join the pride. From the beginning to the end, it only wanted to kill him\!

"Roar—"

Zaha suddenly roared angrily and jumped up. Just as he was about to show his might and use his life's ultimate technique, he suddenly saw dense claws and fangs pounce on him from all directions\!

Catherine, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, the Jerry brothers, and so on pounced forward and attacked him\!

Poor Zaha. Before he could show his might, before he could look at the sexy and strong female leopard again, he was beaten to death by the group\!

He died with a grievance.
