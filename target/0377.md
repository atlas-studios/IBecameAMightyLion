Chapter 377: Untitled

The night was dark and the wind was strong. It was time to kill cows and eat meat\!

After the sky turned completely dark, Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers into the depths of the bushes and circled around from the top.

The members of the pride of the cold father stayed in the camp to guard.

Because it was dark, the water buffaloes had poor vision. Moreover, the water buffaloes were careful. Therefore, the safety of the pride of the cold father would not be a problem.

At this moment, the water buffaloes would never dare to rashly charge into the bushes.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the team past the orchard, the strong male leopard, Blue, brought the female leopard and the Belita sisters and took the initiative to follow behind them, preparing to help.

Because the bushes and nearby animals had fled, the leopard family of four had no choice but to follow and take risks.

On the other hand, the fierce bear and her son did not have any reaction when they saw them. They were still sleeping lazily in the bushes, as if they were not affected by the aggressive water buffaloes outside at all.

They were omnivores. Even without meat, they could survive by eating fruits, plant roots, and some tender leaves.

Although leopards were also omnivores, they could not eat plants.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and quickly walked out of the bushes. He circled around the borders of the territory and headed towards the outermost herd of water buffaloes that were eating grass.

Even if the water buffaloes were eating grass, they were still very careful. Every few bites, they would look up. Furthermore, there were a few water buffaloes acting as sentries, always vigilant of the wind and grass around them.

However, their vision was very weak at night. They could only see ten meters away at most.

Furthermore, the moon was hiding in the clouds tonight. It was dim and there was no light.

The grassland was dark.

In order to set off lightly and retreat quickly, Chu Xiaoye only brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and Blue. The other members stayed 100 meters away for the time being, preparing to receive or ambush them at any time.

The grass on the grassland was lush and almost covered their entire bodies.

The water buffalo's tall body was exceptionally striking.

When they reached 50 meters, Chu Xiaoye and the others immediately slowed down and started to lower their bodies. They advanced carefully, step by step, trying not to make any noise.

In Chu Xiaoye's vision, the location and movements of all the water buffaloes were exceptionally clear.

He chose the closest water buffalo and quietly approached.

Although the water buffaloes were very careful, the dark night and the lush green grass blocked their vision and tempted their instincts. They had to eat grass as soon as possible and had to eat half a pack overnight. Otherwise, they would not have a chance after dawn.

Therefore, under the temptation of the grass, some water buffaloes would unconsciously walk forward and leave the team.

The two water buffaloes lowered their heads to eat grass and walked together. They were only thirty meters away from Chu Xiaoye and the others.

Usually, at this time, it was when the lionesses and cheetahs were preparing to jump up and sprint. However, it was different tonight. The other party was not weak and the tribe would even leave them in the lurch. Therefore, they had to kill them in one move to prevent the other party from escaping or asking for help\!

Thirty meters\!

Twenty meters\!

The two water buffaloes ate the grass under their feet greedily and got closer and closer.

Chu Xiaoye and the others lowered their bodies. Under the cover of the grass and the night, they gathered their courage and continued forward, approaching step by step.

When they were almost ten meters away, one of the water buffaloes seemed to have instinctively sensed something. It suddenly raised its head and looked at the grass in front of it.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision. He jumped up and pounced forward\!

Catherine followed closely\!

Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and Blue jumped up and pounced at the other water buffalo at the side\!

"Mooâ€”"

The first water buffalo had just cried out and before it could lower its head to block with its horns, golden light flashed and a sharp golden claw pierced into its head\!

"Chi\!"

Blood splashed and his bones were pierced\!

A huge force came from his claws. The strong giant water buffalo could not help but stumble forward. With a bang, its knees bent and it knelt on the ground\!

Before it could cry out for help again, the entire cow head was suddenly broken from the middle and its mouth was fiercely pressed into the mud on the ground\!

At the same time, his abdomen suddenly turned cold and his entire stomach was broken with a whoosh\!

Blood sprayed and internal organs splashed\!

The water buffalo's vision turned black and it fell to the ground. The intense pain made its entire body twitch. It wanted to let out its last scream, but its entire mouth was pressed into the soil and it could not make any sound\!

In a few seconds, it died completely\!

On the other side, the second water buffalo had its head smashed by the blue eye that had jumped up high. It was swept by Little Curly Tail's tail and fell to the ground\!

Blue grabbed its throat again and killed it completely\!

At this moment, the other water buffaloes not far away immediately mooed and swung their tails. They lowered their heads and rushed over angrily\!

Chu Xiaoye did not continue fighting. He immediately growled and turned to flee with Little Curly Tail and the others.

More water buffaloes came after hearing the news. They were mighty, murderous, and their hooves rumbled\!

However, when they rushed close, Chu Xiaoye and the others had already fled into the distance. As for the two water buffaloes on the ground, they were dripping with blood and had long stopped breathing\!

The water buffaloes were furious and seemed to want to chase after him, but it was dark in front of them and they had long lost sight of the enemy.

Under the lead bull's cries, the water buffaloes could only stop and give up on chasing. They returned to the front of their two companions and mourned solemnly.

However, in less than two minutes, they dispersed and continued to take the time to eat grass.

However, the death of their companions made them even more vigilant and careful.

All the water buffaloes gathered together, their butts facing each other and their heads facing out. They did not dare to be too far apart.

Chu Xiaoye waited in the grass for a while. Seeing that no water buffaloes were chasing after him, he became even bolder. He immediately let the team members hiding in the grass get up and quietly return to transport the corpses of the two water buffaloes.

He brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and the others and circled in another direction. He approached the water buffaloes again and prepared to continue hunting.

Just as they were quietly approaching the water buffaloes under the cover of the night and grass, Mei Mei and the others, who were transporting the two water buffaloes' corpses, suddenly let out angry roars.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He immediately stood up and looked up.

Mixed Fur jumped up and was fighting a huge lion\!

Mei Mei, the Jerry brothers, and the Belita sisters were roaring as they fought the other lions and female lions.

It turned out that the hunt and the strong smell of blood had attracted another group of lions.

The lions seemed to have long crossed the border of this territory and were hiding in the grass nearby, preparing to kill water buffaloes. When they saw the two freshly killed water buffaloes' corpses, they immediately coveted them. When Mei Mei and the others were transporting the water buffaloes, they suddenly ambushed them halfway.

No one had thought that this group of lions would be so daring to invade their territory and brazenly attack and snatch their prey midway\!

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He no longer cared about hiding and immediately jumped up, charging over with Little Curly Tail and the others.

He wanted to tear this group of bastards who were taking advantage of the situation into pieces\!

When the water buffaloes heard the roar, they immediately lined up in formation. Their hooves were like thunder as they rushed over with a murderous aura.

At this moment, they thought of their companions' corpses.

Chu Xiaoye was even more furious when he saw this scene and hated those damn invaders even more\!

"Kill them all\! Leave none alive\!"

He roared and issued an order. He suddenly jumped up and pounced at the tall lion that was biting Belita, his eyes filled with cold and ferocious killing intent\!
