Chapter 293: Golden Lion King\!

They transported the honey back.

With everyone's help, the black lion's corpse was piled on the grass by the river.

The honey block needed to be melted before it could be smeared.

Chu Xiaoye took this time to lead the team to remove the black lion's fur, head, and internal organs.

Although the internal organs were very delicious for carnivores, this thing was not easy to preserve and was far from being eaten by jerky. There was no need to waste time and honey.

Killing each other was extremely cruel.

After Chu Xiaoye finished dealing with a lion, he was too lazy to do it again. After instructing everyone to continue, he went to fiddle with the honey.

Pieces of bloody headless corpses started to pile on the grass.

They only finished half of it in the evening.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail, the cold father, and the others and started to smear honey on the surface of these flesh. Then, they hung it on the nearby bushes or branches.

He threw away the extremely tough black lion leather armor.

It turned out that he still wanted to use that leather armor to make a soft hedgehog armor and protect his abdomen. In the end, he thought about it and decided to forget it.

In that case, although his abdomen would be safer, his movements would be slower and his various actions would be affected. It might be even more dangerous in battle.

With their current forms, it was better to rely on their own strength than rely on external forces.

He busied himself for the night.

The black lion's corpse was finally finished.

Just the bushes in the pride of the cold father were filled with bloody corpses. They did not look terrifying.

However, this was more intimidating.

When the sky was about to brighten, Chu Xiaoye asked everyone to disperse and go back to rest.

The cold father still stayed beside his old companions, feeling all sorts of respect and grateful gazes.

When the pride dispersed, some carnivores that smelled blood rushed over one after another and started to wolf the remaining flesh and dregs of the black lions on the grass by the river.

After dawn, groups of vultures also fell from the sky.

The hyenas that had heard the news came wave after wave, and many battles even happened.

Under Chu Xiaoye's orders, the pride stayed in place and did not chase them away. They even deliberately stayed away from the flesh and dregs.

This feast lasted for the entire day.

In the evening.

Not a single bone was left in the place filled with the remains of the black lion's corpse. Even the black fur that was scattered in the grass was snatched away by various animals. They either went to show off, placed them in caves as nests, or brought them to the tree to build nests.

The crocodiles in the river also ate until their stomachs were round. They lay on the shore and were unwilling to move.

The animals in the forest also came hungry and returned with their stomachs bulging.

The ants and small insects in the ground also came majestically and returned with a load.

Even the blood on the grass was eaten by small bugs happily.

The cleaners on the grassland cleaned everything left behind from the battle after a day.

In the evening.

This territory returned to its former peace.

Everyone did their jobs and did their own things.

Brother Flat Top took the initiative to follow Chu Xiaoye back to the bushes in the territory and dug holes to settle down. Soon, he blended in with the pit and the two young cubs.

Because this Brother Flat Top was also called a honey badger, Chu Xiaoye named him Little Mi.

Little Mi was very afraid of Little Curly Tail and was especially afraid of his tail. It was like how Big Pit was afraid of Little Curly Tail.

Back then, Little Curly Tail would bring the big hole to the tree every night and place it in the storage room full of warthog jerky for the night. As a warthog, the big hole left an unforgettable shadow in his heart.

The fearless Brother Flat Top clearly had a deep psychological shadow over Little Curly Tail's terrifying tail.

Therefore, the two brothers appreciated each other and soon became best friends who could talk about anything and even poop together.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and prepared to sleep.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei climbed up. However, before they could approach, Tilly jumped over from another tree and lay opposite Chu Xiaoye.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei looked at each other and curled their lips in tacit understanding. They lay on the branch below.

This female cub was even more infatuated with her brother than Catherine\!

Catherine lay in the grass under the tree and raised her head to watch this scene silently. Her dark eyes trembled.

Soon, everyone fell asleep.

At midnight, Chu Xiaoye was suddenly woken up by a buzzing sound.

When he saw that the thing flying beside his ear was only an ordinary mosquito, he heaved a sigh of relief.

After waking up, he no longer felt sleepy.

He quietly climbed down the tree and walked into the depths of the bushes, preparing to pick a few fruits in the orchard to quench his thirst.

They had just walked for a distance when they suddenly heard the sound of wings flapping above them. They looked up and saw a few huge bats stealing the corpses of the black lions they had hung on the tree to dry\!

The corpses of a few black lions had already been stolen by a group of bats and quickly left.

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and climbed up the tree. He suddenly jumped up and the golden melon flashed, cutting the few bats that were about to leave with their food into pieces\!

The fur fell and blood splashed\!

The other bats beside him immediately abandoned the black lion's corpse and fled while squeaking.

Chu Xiaoye's roar immediately woke Little Curly Tail and the others up.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Catherine, Tilly, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly climbed up the tree and jumped over. They started to roar and hit the bats that were stealing food.

The bats that were stealing food from other trees immediately screamed and fled.

Many food that had yet to dry fell to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He immediately brought his friends and jumped and roared on the tree, chasing away the bats that were unwilling to leave.

"Whoosh\!"

The black mass of bats immediately flew into the sky, but they did not leave. Instead, they circled above the bushes, not preparing to leave.

Little Curly Tail stood at the top of the tree angrily, wagging his tail and roaring for them to come down and fight.

Catherine and the others jumped around the tree and guarded the food hanging on the branches.

Seeing that there were not many losses, Chu Xiaoye immediately got down from the tree and ran towards the other bushes.

Fortunately, the food hanging on the trees in the other bushes was not snatched by the bats.

He roared and called Lars and One-eyed over, telling them to send team members to strengthen the guards in every bush with food hanging on them. He would roar in turns and not stop.

The food that they had painstakingly saved could not be stolen by these thieves in the night.

Hence, throughout the night, the roars of lions could be heard from the neighboring bushes.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and the others back to patrol in a few bushes. They finally waited until dawn.

Dawn appeared. Before the sun could rise, the night thieves flying in the sky disappeared without a trace.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to rest. He brought Little Curly Tail and the others to dig many tree holes at the bottom of some thick trees. They used the dried black lion fur to spread it in the tree holes, preparing to store dry food.

In the middle of the territory of those elderly lions, Big Pit and Little Mi were also sent to dig storage rooms underground.

Under the watch of a group of lions, the two brothers worked in full swing and did not dare to be lazy.

At the same time.

On the grassland seven to eight kilometers away from this territory, another team formed by a strong male and female lion, as well as young cubs and elderly lions was retreating here.

The leading young lion king looked to be only three years old. His fur flickered with a golden luster under the sun. His blue eyes were filled with determination. His aura was noble and majestic, causing all the female lions following behind him to be fascinated.

They had lost, but it was an honorable defeat\!

Under the lead of this young lion king, they killed nearly 300 black lions, including the other party's lionesses and cubs.

This young and powerful king told them that they were only retreating strategically and would fight back soon\!

They were full of trust and hope for him\!
