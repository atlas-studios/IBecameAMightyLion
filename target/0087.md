Chapter 87: Little Leopard's SOS

Morning.

Chu Xiaoye was woken up by the heat at dawn.

The sun was like a fire, continuing to mercilessly roast this long withered land.

Chu Xiaoye had no choice but to wake Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei up and quickly hide in the shade under the tree.

The cold father had already crawled into the dense bushes. He opened his mouth and lay inside motionless.

The female lions also hid in the dense bushes.

During the day, if there were no accidents, they would continue to lie like this and not move around.

On the grassland in the distance, the ground started to crack.

The withered grass hung its head. The herbivores seemed to have disappeared and no one could be seen.

Even the air he breathed seemed to be burning hot.

Chu Xiaoye felt terrible lying down. He got up and crawled into the bushes at the back. He decided to go to the orchard to find a few fruits to eat.

At the same time, he wanted to test his newly evolved left claw.

Catherine looked at him secretly. She hesitated for a moment before getting up and following him.

She liked to tail him and peep at him.

Even if they did not have any contact and she just looked at him from afar, she would be very happy.

Chu Xiaoye had just entered the orchard when he saw a patterned tail and a butt covered in patterns in the dense grass.

Not far in front of him, there was a bird with beautiful feathers pecking at the rotten fruits on the ground.

"Is the female leopard hunting birds?"

Thinking of how arrogant this female leopard was when he passed by here last night, Chu Xiaoye decided to teach her a lesson.

He lowered his body and quietly sneaked over.

Just as she got close, he suddenly roared and pounced on her, pressing against her body, preparing to scare her\!

However, why did this little female leopard suddenly become so slender and small?

"Whoosh—"

The animal under him hurriedly twisted its body and crawled out. Then, it jumped three meters high and bared its sharp teeth at him, letting out a sharp roar\!

She had a long ear and fur full of patterns. Her limbs were long, and she was slender and small. Her face was extremely similar to that of a little leopard\!

It was a serval\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and looked at her in shock.

The serval bared her fangs and let out a threatening roar. She looked at him with fear and ferocity as her body trembled.

As for the little bird pecking at the fruits, it was already frightened away.

"Roar—"

Although he was in the wrong first, a lion must not lose face.

Chu Xiaoye pretended to be fierce and roared before taking a few steps forward.

The serval did not hesitate and turned to flee. She was extremely fast and disappeared into the bushes in the distance.

The success rate this animal had when hunting could be said to be the highest among the carnivores in the entire grassland, and it could even reach 100%.

Of course, they only preyed on small animals, such as rats, birds, and even insects.

They were agile and could jump extremely well, but they were small and looked like domestic cats. Therefore, they became the targets of many humans' hunting and selling.

They were almost on the verge of extinction.

Normally, during a dry season like this, they would not appear in the bushes where the large carnivores were stationed.

Thinking of the Komodo Dragon last time, Chu Xiaoye had a faint ominous feeling.

Could the surroundings or other places have been severely damaged?

Humans were slaughtering indiscriminately and constantly invading the living space of animals. All sorts of poaching and hunting also pushed many animals to the edge.

When would they stop doing this?

As a member of this grassland, Chu Xiaoye had no choice but to worry about whether his future life would be ruined irreversibly.

At that time, no matter how powerful he was, where could he go?

The intelligence and strength of humans were definitely not something an animal could resist.

Could it be that at that time, all of them, the animals that were struggling on the grassland, would be caught and sent to the zoo for human viewing?

Or would he be cruelly trained and domesticated?

No\!

Lions would never be slaves\!

If that day really came, he would definitely flee far away or risk his life against them\!

Even if he died, he did not want to be imprisoned\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

Just as he was letting his imagination run wild, the little leopard suddenly ran out of the forest in front of him and roared at him anxiously.

The little leopard was limping and was clearly injured.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly ran over and was about to check on her injuries when the little leopard suddenly turned around and ran away with a limp. It still let out an anxious roar, as if it was begging.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze froze and he immediately followed her.

Soon, he heard the female leopard's trembling roar. Her voice seemed to be filled with fear.

At the same time, he smelled a lion.

They passed through a patch of bushes.

The figure of the female leopard immediately appeared on the grass in front of him.

She curled up on the ground, bared her fangs, and was covered in blood. Her body was trembling violently, and she was clearly terrified to the extreme.

Beside her were three adult female lions.

They were the lionesses of the Seno brothers' pride.

They were both pregnant, but their fur was messy and they looked haggard. Their open mouths were dripping with saliva. Clearly, they had not eaten for a few days.

And this female leopard was the prey they were going to hunt today\!

With the leopard's speed and agility, and with so many trees nearby, these female lions definitely could not bite her like this and surround her.

The only possibility was that this little leopard, who always loved to run around, had been ambushed by the female lions and bitten by them. Her mother, on the other hand, had rushed over to save her without hesitation, which was why this scene happened.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the little leopard beside him. He found her shivering pitifully.

She was so pitiful he really wanted to fart at her\!

However, these three female lions were really unrestrained\!

This forest was the territory of the cold father's pride\!

Wasn't the lesson from the Komodo Dragon enough?

They had crossed the line so brazenly and snatched food and resources that did not belong to their territory. This was a huge crime and they broke the rules\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and walked over.

He was a member of the pride of the cold father. He could not ignore this behavior of invading his territory to snatch food and resources\!

Since this leopard mother-daughter pair lived in their territory, they belonged to the pride of the cold father\!

Even if they wanted to eat, they would be the ones to eat them\!

It was not for other lions\!

The three female lions that were attacking the female leopard immediately stopped biting and looked at him fiercely.

It was just a young cub\!

They immediately relaxed.

Even if the Seno brothers' pride lost a lion, they were definitely not something that this weak pride could compare to\!

Since this stupid cub was courting death today, they could take this opportunity to bite him to death and make this pride even weaker\!

At that time, this territory would completely belong to the Seno brothers' pride\!
