Chapter 81: Pleasurable and Sour

Lars left.

The pride returned to the camp in silence.

The usually lively and active Little Curly Tail also quietened down at this moment. He lowered his head. Other crocodiles were hiding as if he was thinking about something.

He seemed to understand something.

He raised his head and looked at his father, the majestic but cold and heartless king.

In the future, would he be expelled as well?

Then.

He turned around and looked at his brother.

His eyes gradually lit up again.

The anxiety and worry in his heart were also swept away at this moment.

What was he afraid of?

As long as his brother was by his side, he was not afraid of anything\!

At most, he would go with his brother to reclaim a larger territory\!

With his brother's ability and strength, plus his intelligence, who could resist him on the grassland?

Hmph\!

They were all trash\!

Not a single one of them could fight\!

At the thought of this, Little Curly Tail's depressed mood was swept away. He immediately became high-spirited and his fighting spirit soared\!

He hoped to grow up faster\!

"Roar\!"

He called out excitedly and leaned towards his brother, rubbing against his body affectionately.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him.

Little Curly Tail went to Mei Mei's side and scratched her tail with his claws before running away quickly.

However, Mei Mei ignored him.

Under the hot sun, everyone was so hot that their mouths were dry.

Mei Mei drooled at the thought of the especially sweet water her brother had gotten from who knew where.

The cold father brought the pride and did not return to the camp. Instead, he walked towards the hill.

He was very thirsty and wanted to go and drink some water.

However, he did not know that at the foot of the hill, the river that was still muddy yesterday had completely dried up today.

Beside the river, a few monkeys stood in a daze, still waiting bitterly.

They seemed to think that the disappeared river water would soon reappear.

They had been standing there since morning, and their mouths were dry.

A monkey had already fainted from the hot sun and had no chance to get up.

In the mud at the bottom of the river, an old crocodile lay motionless, having lost its life.

The cold father brought the pride down the hill and came to the river. He looked at the bare riverbed silently.

When he was on the hill, he had already seen that there was no water in the river.

However, he still had to approach and confirm it.

Usually, lions could obtain water from their food. Their requirement for water was not as high as that of other animals.

However, in such weather, one would have a dry mouth and throat if they moved around slightly. They would have to drink water to hydrate themselves.

The dryness of the river was a huge threat to the pride.

It was not just because of the water and prey, but also because of the wandering lion on the other side of the river.

When the river was abundant in the past, there were a few wandering lions on the other side who were roaring and provoking him, coveting his territory and his female lions.

They did not come because of the river's obstruction.

Now that the river water was dry, they would be free of obstruction.

The cold father stood by the river in a dignified and silent manner. He raised his head and looked at the opposite shore, his eyes filled with coldness and worry.

Maya walked to his side and rubbed against his body, urging him to leave.

She was pregnant.

He could not stay under the sun for long in this weather.

The other lionesses were also panting from the heat.

The cold father looked at the dry riverbed again and turned around to leave with the lions.

The dead crocodiles in the mud and the unconscious monkey by the river not far away did not attract their attention.

The hot weather and the hot sun made them have no appetite, and they did not want to take risks and waste their energy.

There were other crocodiles hiding in the mud in the river.

As for the monkeys on the shore, they were so thin that they had no meat.

They were hot and thirsty. They had to quickly return to the shade of the camp and lie down to rest.

The vulture circled in the sky and looked down with its sharp eyes at the corpse by the river.

They were very patient and could even observe in the sky for a few days.

When they confirmed that the animal lying on the ground was really dead, they would land and continue to probe.

The other carnivores in the distance were hiding in the shade, looking up at its movements.

Many carnivores used each other.

Vultures could find the corpses of other carnivores according to their movements, and other carnivores could also move according to their movements.

If the animals' fur was too thick, the vultures would not mind letting other carnivores with sharp teeth share the food.

They were the cleaners of the grassland.

The cold father brought the pride back to the camp. They each found a shade and lay in it. They opened their mouths and closed their eyes to avoid exhausting their strength and energy.

Catherine lay in the bushes and looked up at the figure with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree under the hot sun.

After a while, he picked up a water bag full of water and climbed down from the tree, walking in front of his mother.

Aisha opened her eyes and looked at the thing in his mouth with surprise.

It was the bladder of a gnu, and the bladder was filled with water.

Chu Xiaoye carefully placed the water bag in front of her and aimed it at her, signaling her to drink quickly.

Aisha looked at him deeply and quickly stuck out her tongue to lick.

This son of hers always exceeded her expectations.

Xi'er, who was lying not far away, watched this scene with gentleness in her eyes, as if she was looking at her child.

Mei Mei, who was lying beside her, immediately stood up and ran to Chu Xiaoye's side. She twisted her body and tried to lick his butt.

She seemed to be saying, "Brother, Mei Mei is so thirstyâ€¦"

Little Curly Tail immediately rushed over and knocked her to the side. He looked at her disdainfully, as if he was saying, "Licking a lion\! You don't know shame\! This is my brother\!"

Then, he stuck out his tongue to lick his brother, but his brother glared at him and immediately retracted his tongue.

After his mother drank the water, Chu Xiaoye looked at them and gestured for them to drink.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately leaned over happily.

After Little Curly Tail drank the water and was about to return to the shade to lie down again, Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his claw and gave him a slap. He looked at him with a dignified gaze and let him pick up the water bag to bring water to the other members.

Little Curly Tail saw his brother looking at their father.

He immediately understood.

Brother is so good\!

His brother had given him this task of sucking up for nothing\!

He immediately picked up the water bag excitedly and ran in front of his father, handing it over with a fawning expression.

"Bam\!"

The water bag suddenly fell to the ground and the water inside splashed in front of the cold father. It quickly seeped into the grass and disappeared.

Little Curly Tail's mouth was open in shock.

The cold father opened his eyes and looked at him coldly.

At this moment.

In the orchard a mile behind.

A pair of leopards, a mother and daughter, were lying on a fruit tree, baring their teeth and frowning as they ate the green fruits. They were so sour that their heads swayed and their bodies trembled.

However, the cool water in the fruits made their burning throats and thirsty bodies scream in pleasure: Go on\! Go on\! One more\!

The mother-daughter pair chewed as their bodies trembled. The fruits were sour but felt satisfying, and their joy was boundless.

Belita ate one after another.

From today onwards, this orchard would be occupied by the mother and daughter\!

No animal could dream of eating fruits\!

Including the smelly cub that was forcing her to eat fruits\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

Belita cried out happily, but she could not help but tremble. Her sour mouth and eyes were slanted, and her tail was wagging.
