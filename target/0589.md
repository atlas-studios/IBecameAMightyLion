Chapter 589: Brother

Thunderous roars and dust flew\!

The two ferocious beasts were extremely strong. After fighting for dozens of minutes, the lion lost.

Although lions were fierce and strong, ferocious tigers were more agile and cunning.

In the end, the lion's spine was bitten off by the colorful tiger and it fell to the ground. Then, it was bitten to death.

Although the ferocious tiger won, it was also covered in wounds.

Before it could rest, the iron bars opened and a strong rhinoceros rushed out with a murderous aura.

Just as the ferocious tiger reacted, it was sent flying by the furious rhinoceros with a bang and fell heavily seven to eight meters away.

The rhinoceros rushed up again\!

The colorful tiger had just got up from the ground when the sharp rhinoceros horn suddenly pierced into its neck\!

The rhinoceros raised its head and fixed it on its head, starting to run crazily in the field.

Excited cheers and applause immediately sounded from the surrounding stands.

Before long, the colorful tiger that had defeated the lion bled all over the ground and died\!

Just as the people on the stands were cheering loudly, the iron bars opened again and a beautiful lioness walked out.

The silver-haired youth sitting in the stands immediately trembled and clenched his fists.

The female lion was much smaller than the violent rhinoceros, so when they saw it come out, the people on the stands did not clap much.

But soon, they were shocked.

When the violent rhinoceros saw the female lion, it immediately rushed up angrily and prepared to send the female lion flying like just now.

However, when it ran in front of the lionesses with a murderous aura, the lionesses suddenly jumped and landed steadily on its back.

Before the surrounding spectators could cry out in shock, the young female lion suddenly raised her claws. With a blue flash, she pierced through the thick rhinoceros skin with a whoosh and pierced into the rhinoceros’ flesh\!

The rhinoceros ran crazily in the field, but it could not shake off the female lion on its back.

In the end, it actually fell like the colorful tiger and bled to death.

The rhinoceros fell heavily to the dust.

The young lioness jumped steadily to the ground. She raised her head and looked coldly at the excited people.

"I'll bet on this lioness\! I'll bet on this lioness\!"

Many people immediately placed their bets on this lioness.

At this moment, the iron bars opened again and a saber-toothed tiger walked out.

The expressions of the people who were pressing the female lions changed and they cursed loudly.

"This is unfair\! It's unfair\!"

However, no one bothered with them.

The saber-toothed tiger was like a king. It raised its head and stuck out its chest. It paced in the arena and slowly walked towards the young lioness.

As for the young lioness, she actually stood in place without fear and looked at it.

"Roar\!"

The saber-toothed tiger suddenly roared angrily and rushed up.

Just as it rushed in front of the female lions, the young female lion jumped over its head and landed behind it.

The saber-toothed tiger swung its tail, turned its head, and pounced forward again.

The young lioness was not in a hurry to fight and continued to dodge. She used her agile movements and lightning-like speed to dodge the ferocious attack of the saber-toothed tiger.

Half an hour later, just as the people in the stands were cursing impatiently, the young lioness finally started to attack.

"Whoosh\!"

She jumped over the saber-toothed tiger's head and landed behind it. Before the saber-toothed tiger could turn around, her sharp claws suddenly swung at its butt and grabbed a large piece of flesh.

"Roar\!"

The saber-toothed tiger was shocked and furious. It hurriedly turned around and pounced.

However, because it had been attacking and chasing for a long time, it had already exhausted a lot of energy. Its reaction speed was already much slower than before.

Just as it turned around, the young lioness jumped up and landed behind it. She swung her claws and grabbed another big piece of flesh from its butt.

"Too smart\! That lioness is too smart\!"

"Hahahaha\! We bet correctly\!"

The people who had bet on this young lioness previously immediately became excited when they saw this scene.

The saber-toothed tiger roared continuously and pounced crazily, but it was played around by the young lioness. The flesh behind its butt was already blurry.

At this moment, this huge monster finally became terrified. It stopped attacking and started to defend passively.

However, the young lioness was too fast for it to resist.

Soon, it was covered in wounds.

It panted heavily and its movements became even slower.

The young lioness was still not in a hurry and continued to attack carefully. With every claw, she could scratch a large piece of flesh off the saber-toothed tiger.

This exciting life and death battle immediately brought the atmosphere of the entire colosseum to a climax.

The spectators cried out hoarsely in excitement.

At this moment, the silver-haired youth who was originally sitting in the stands had disappeared at some point in time.

On the colosseum, blood splashed and the miserable cries of the saber-toothed tiger lingered.

Behind those iron bars, a cruel battle was happening. Soldiers guarding the ferocious beasts fell into a pool of blood one after another.

Before long, the saber-toothed tiger finally could not hold on and fell to the ground, never to get up again.

The female lion stopped attacking and did not kill them.

At this moment, the iron bars on all sides were open.

Strong hyenas walked out from behind the iron bars. There were more than twenty of them\!

"It's unfair\! This is unfair\!"

The people who had previously bet on the young lionesses immediately shouted.

More than twenty spotted hyenas formed a circle, surrounding the young lioness in the middle and slowly approaching.

Everyone finally saw fear on the young lioness's face.

The hyenas and lions were mortal enemies, and the spotted hyenas relied on their numbers to often bully other predators or lone female lions on the grassland.

Although this young lioness was strong, she would definitely be doomed when surrounded by so many spotted hyenas.

The rule here was that if a ferocious beast won three rounds in a row, it could return safely to heal.

However, clearly, this young lioness no longer had that chance.

The twenty-plus spotted hyenas narrowed the encirclement and bared their sharp fangs, preparing to attack.

Right at this moment, with a bang, a house behind the iron bars not far away suddenly collapsed\!

Then, a terrifying roar sounded in everyone's ears like thunder\!

"Roar—"

The roar rushed into the sky, rushed out of the Bestial Battle Arena, and rushed out of the town, filling the entire world\!

The people in the stands felt their eardrums about to explode. They were seeing stars and had a splitting headache, as if an extremely terrifying energy wave was attacking\!

As for the twenty-over hyenas that were about to kill, their bodies instantly turned limp and they fell to the ground, peeing and pooping\!

Dust flew everywhere from the collapsed houses\!

A huge lion covered in golden light walked out of the dust that filled the sky and walked towards the middle of the Bestial Battle Arena, towards the female lion that was stunned in place.

The young lioness trembled as she looked at it.

It was not fear or despair, but tears of joy.

She recognized him at a glance\!

"Brother\!"

Tears flowed down her face as she ran over\!
