Chapter 13: Viper Killer\!

After dawn.

The lion had returned, and its stomach was rumbling with hunger.

After running around for a long time last night, he did not find any food.

Under his hoarse and impatient growl, the four female lions bid farewell to the cubs and continued their hunt.

The lioness with a broken tail stayed behind to look after the cubs.

Chu Xiaoye woke up very early.

He stood on a big tree, welcoming the fiery red dawn. After watching the lionesses leave, he began to repeat all kinds of strange actions.

When Mei Mei woke up, she followed suit.

Seeing that the lioness cub had sneaked onto the tree to play with his older brother, Little Curly Tail climbed up hurriedly as well and brushed her away from his older brother rudely. 

"This is my brother\!"

His angry look seemed to be saying this.

He could not allow this timid and cunning lioness cub to snatch his brother's love away from him\!

Little Curly Tail bared his teeth at Meimei. After threatening her, he immediately followed Chu Xiaoye and did those strange actions.

After a while, he was panting from exhaustion.

Meimei ignored him and stood on a nearby branch, practising Chu Xiaoye's movements seriously.

Although she did not know the meaning of these actions, she trusted Chu Xiaoye very much.

His training of tree-climbing back then was very good proof.

Hence, no matter what this brother did, she would follow.

Soon.

She was so tired that her muscles were trembling and her entire body was aching. She had no strength left.

After a short rest, she pulled herself together and continued to do it.

Although Little Curly Tail was also very tired and wanted to go down to rest or play, since this lioness cub was not afraid of fatigue, he naturally could not admit defeat\!

He could not let his brother look down on him\!

Therefore, he worked even harder than before.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the two kids and smiled.

He lowered his head and looked down at the other cubs. They were still playing around without any worries as if they could not feel the impending danger.

Lars, who was only a year old, was sprinting seriously at the small tree.

The hyena from last time must have scared him quite a bit.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment, climbed down the tree, and walked over to the group of cubs who were playing. He let out a low growl, hoping that they could practice tree-climbing with Lars.

However, these cubs were having fun and no one bothered with him.

Even a big brother like Lars could not control them, let alone a little brother like him who was ranked last.

Yesterday, they had followed Lars for a while and felt that it was too difficult and boring, so they gave up.

Chu Xiaoye sighed in his heart. He turned around and saw that Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei had climbed down from the tree and were looking at him with trust and intimacy.

"Roar\!"

He called out and decided to bring the two adorable little fellows to practice running.

Speed and endurance could not only save their lives in times of danger, but also allow them to better capture prey in the future.

"One, two, one\!"

He shouted in his heart as he ran.

In the end, he realized that his four legs did not match the rhythm of this slogan.

He almost did not know how to run.

He could only give up.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately followed behind him and started running.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to run too far away and only ran around the surrounding bushes.

When they passed by a dense patch of bushes on their second round, Mei Mei, who was running, suddenly jumped up and fell to the ground. She let out a terrified scream as she rolled and crawled backwards\!

Chu Xiaoye quickly stopped and ran over to check on the situation.

"Whoosh—"

In the grass, there was a black cobra with an oval head and bulging skin on its neck. It was standing upright and raised its head, emitting a terrifying threatening sound\!

Mei Mei limped back in fright.

The female cub had obviously been bitten\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart sank\!

The cobra was extremely venomous. Even an adult lion would fear this venom, let alone a young cub.

After a mature female lion was bitten, if there was not much venom, it might not be fatal. But after a young cub is bitten, it might very well die\!

Mei Mei took a few steps back and was already lying on the ground. It was obvious that the poison had already contaminated her blood and was quickly entering her body through the blood\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to delay any further. He hurriedly ran to her side and crawled in front of her. Without any explanation, he used his teeth to press against her wound and used the saliva in his mouth to wipe it\!

Mei Mei lay on the ground shivering. She was clearly scared silly.

Little Curly Tail bared his teeth and let out an angry and provocative roar. He faced the cobra and was ready to pounce on it\!

Chu Xiaoye quickly turned around and growled, asking him to retreat\!

Little Curly Tail seemed to know how powerful this thing was. Just as he took two steps back, the cobra suddenly chased after him with a whoosh\!

Raising its head, it hissed and had an arrogant look full of conceit and pomp\!   

Little Curly Tail was furious. He raised his claw and hit its head\!

The cobra tilted its head and nimbly dodged his claws. It opened its mouth and ferociously bit at him\!

Little Curly Tail hurriedly jumped back and narrowly dodged it\!

The cobra was very pleased with itself. Just as it was about to launch a second attack, the grass beside it suddenly moved. A black shadow suddenly jumped out like lightning and pounced on its head\!

"Whoosh\!"

The cobra's reaction was extremely fast. Its entire upper body hurriedly leaned back and narrowly avoided the black shadow\!

The black shadow landed on the ground without any fear and directly faced it. Its dark eyes were filled with excitement and desire.

Its body was small and its head was flat. Its fur was rough and black and white. Its claws were extremely strong and sharp\!

It was the legendary Brother Flat Top—the Honey Badger\!

Chu Xiaoye turned to look and was secretly shocked.

When the previously arrogant cobra saw this little thing that was even smaller than a cub, it turned around and slid away without hesitation\!

The venom it was so proud of did not affect this little thing\!

This was the famous Viper Killer who made vipers tremble in fear\!

"Whoosh\!"

When the cobra turned around to escape, the honey badger suddenly jumped up and pounced on it, biting its tail\!

Usually, when a honey badger hunted a venomous snake, it would attack head-on and bite its head and neck. This way, the venomous snake would die faster and would not continue attacking it.

Although the body of a honey badger could resist the venom of a poisonous snake, no one wanted to be bitten a few more times.

But now, this honey badger was biting the cobra's tail. It did not even think about the venomous fangs of the cobra and whether it would turn around and bite it\!

This was true arrogance\!

However, what was even more arrogant was yet to come\!

Perhaps the cobra was traumatized and fearful of this little thing. After being bitten in the tail, it did not turn around to bite. Instead, it continued to twist its body and escape\!

As for the honey badger, as it ran, it chewed on the cobra's tail and started to eat\!

Little Curly Tail was dumbfounded.

Mei Mei also widened her eyes in shock.

What was this?

How could it be more domineering than the lion of the grassland\!

That was probably what the siblings were thinking.
