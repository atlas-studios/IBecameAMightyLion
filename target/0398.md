Chapter 398: Untitled

The python fell to the ground and died completely.

Chu Xiaoye ignored the cold father's pitiful and contradictory gaze and walked in front of the python's upper body. He observed it carefully and realized that this python looked like a forest python that had once appeared in the Amazon forest.

The forest boa was called the largest snake in the world by humans. It was more than ten meters long and was a predator at the top of the food chain in the South American river.

An adult forest python would even prey on caimans. Its skin could be extended many times and it could swallow prey that was much larger than itself.

The strangulation power of this animal was extremely astonishing. As long as prey was wrapped by its thick body, most of them would die.

However, this animal was a water-loving animal and usually liked to live in the primitive forest on both sides of the river. It was fine if it did not move, but its movements were astonishing.

Many natives in South America had changed their expressions when they heard this and regarded them as gods.

However, why was it here?

Chu Xiaoye looked at the ferocious python head and its thick and long body on the ground, then raised his head and looked at the distant ancient forest, his eyes filled with seriousness.

It seemed that this ancient primitive forest was not only filled with ferocious and powerful animals like tigers. Many powerful killers had yet to appear.

The members of the pride rushed over.

The cold father stood in front of the python's lower body, raised his head, and stuck out his chest. He pressed a claw on the snake's body, and his face was covered in blood. He looked majestic, as if he had just finished fighting.

Catherine looked at the members of the pride and did not see the human girl. She immediately left and ran towards the camp.

When Chu Xiaoye returned with the pride, Catherine was silently guarding the little girl. She watched in a daze as the little girl used the sharp knife in her hand to carefully cut the fur of a black antelope.

Although her hands were covered in blood, the little girl no longer had any fear and cut them exceptionally seriously.

She seemed to have adapted to this bloodiness.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and shook his head secretly.

Indeed, girls loved to be beautiful, even in situations where life and death were unpredictable.

The little girl seemed to want to prepare another shirt for herself to replace her current one.

However, she seemed to have forgotten that she was escaping. Even if she cut off the black antelope's fur completely, she did not have the time to dry it.

Furthermore, she could not even walk. How could she bring this fur?

Chu Xiaoye did not disturb her stupid mood. He walked in front of the prey at the side and continued to eat.

After the cold father returned, he seemed to have forgotten his stubbornness and backbone just now. He immediately started to wolf down the food, as if nothing had happened just now.

The other members of the pride also took the time to eat.

After eating and drinking their fill, everyone rested in place.

Chu Xiaoye personally brought Little Curly Tail and the others to patrol the surroundings to prevent other ferocious beasts from attacking.

The night was calm and nothing happened.

After dawn, everyone prepared to set off.

The little girl dragged the black antelope fur that had yet to dry and walked to the cold father's side. Without any explanation, she draped it on his back and covered his butt.

During the day, the little girl realized that this lion always peeped at the antelope fur on her body from time to time and thought that he liked it too. Therefore, when she saw the black antelope, she had the intention of making a shirt for him to thank him for carrying it.

The cold father was stunned by her actions. He turned around and looked at her. He was furious and his body suddenly trembled. He shook off the black antelope skin and glared at her.

This little thing actually made him, a dignified lion, wear the skin of an antelope. It was a huge insult\!

Seeing that her gift had been exchanged for the lion's disdain and anger, the little girl could not help but be a little sad and dejected.

Indeed, everyone hated her.

Not only was she useless, she was also always a burden to the pride. Of course, they would not like her.

The cold father glared at her and left, not preparing to carry her again.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front and only looked back before continuing forward.

The pride followed behind him. No one cared about this useless little thing.

The little girl lowered her head. After feeling sad for a few seconds, she immediately raised her head and chased after him, her eyes filled with determination.

She would not be defeated by this small setback\!

After a day of arduous trekking, Chu Xiaoye finally arrived at the peak of the second mountain with the team.

Standing on the mountain peak, he looked down at the foot of the mountain on the other side. A larger primitive forest appeared in his vision. In the middle of the primitive forest, a river meandered past like a long dragon, shaking its head and wagging its tail. It passed through the mountain and its end could not be seen.

Chu Xiaoye felt a little regretful that he did not see the grassland of his dreams.

He knew that the ancient primitive forest would become their new home in the future until they found a better place.

The sun was setting on the horizon, illuminating the clouds like flames.

The members of the pride looked up at the unfamiliar environment in front of them. They were uneasy, hesitant, excited and expectant.

"Croakâ€”"

Suddenly, a sharp cry came from the distant sky\!

Then, a huge black shadow broke out of the cloud and swooped down quickly, landing in the vast primitive forest and disappearing.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked\!

The black shadow spread its wings and was six to seven meters long. Its claws were as sharp as blades and its mouth was sharp and long. As for its tail, it was like a long whip. Its entire appearance was rather fierce and it was actually a little similar to the legendary pterosaur\!

Chu Xiaoye had never seen or heard of such birds.

How many secrets were hidden in this ancient forest?

Chu Xiaoye seemed to have discovered a new continent, or rather, a new world. He was excited and uneasy.

He suddenly thought of the mysterious dinosaur skeleton hiding at the bottom of the lake.

Could dinosaurs still exist in this world?

However, they were all hidden in secret places that humans could not step foot in and had yet to be discovered by humans?

Deep sea, forest, even underground, or another planet?

"Roar\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was letting his imagination run wild, an angry roar suddenly came from the mountaintop beside him\!

Then, a huge black bear nearly two meters tall ran over with a murderous aura. Behind it was a group of lions\!

There were about ten lions, two lions, and the rest were female lions. At this moment, they were like the subordinates of the big black bear, roaring as they ran over.

Looking at this strange group, Chu Xiaoye was stunned at first. Then, he turned around and looked at his team.

The world had changed, the bad situation had changed, the animals had changed, and the rules had started to change.

The strong were king, and there was no restriction on species\!

This was the most chaotic and exciting era. All sorts of experts and heroes would appear at this time, and the true king would be born at this time\!
