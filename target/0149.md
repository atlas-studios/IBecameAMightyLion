Chapter 149: Monster Attack

Late at night.

This place was still lively.

More and more small animals rushed to this orchard to hunt.

It was as if they were holding a grand dinner party that was new to the world.

Guests dressed in all sorts of clothes and appearances rushed to the banquet.

The monkey was like an attendant for this dinner. It kept throwing fruits on the branches and treated the group of beautiful guests warmly.

A group of flickering butterflies flew over after hearing the news and danced elegantly in the forest. Their postures were beautiful, and they immediately added more light to this lively little world.

This was like a fairy tale world.

Chu Xiaoye was not sleepy.

He lay in the grass and quietly watched this peaceful and beautiful scene. His mood that was restless for tomorrow and worried for the future gradually calmed down.

However, he did not envy them.

Every creature had its own way of survival.

Some creatures lived a peaceful life, while others fought their entire lives.

As lions, they were born to fight.

They fought for their survival, their homes, their wives and children, and their dignity.

They would grow up in battle and survive. In the end, they would die in battle.

This was the magnificent life of a lion.

They were proud of this and honored it\!

Chu Xiaoye's gaze followed his thoughts and passed through the dark forest, the boundless night, and the lofty mountain range to the other side of the mountain.

That would be where he would fight.

That would be the place he would fight for his responsibility and honor\!

He would open up a new home there, protect his family, and use his life to protect them\!

Usually.

Beauty was mostly temporary.

Or they were all fake.

Under a fruit tree not far away, a snow-white rabbit was lowering its head to eat fruits.

The liveliness and harmony around it made it feel very at ease.

It finished one and went to the back of the tree to pick up another.

A vine full of green leaves was wrapped around the root of this fruit tree.

At some point in time, the vine's head hung down and landed on the ground. Then, it quietly crawled behind the rabbit.

The rabbit seemed to have sensed the movement and turned around.

"Whoosh\!"

A bloody mouth full of sharp fangs suddenly opened from the vines and bit its head\!

The rabbit was shocked and hurriedly twisted its body, struggling to move its limbs\!

However, its entire head was quickly devoured by the bloody mouth. Soon, it suffocated to death.

Around them, the other small animals were still happily having dinner.

And this rabbit soon disappeared\!

After a short pause, the thick green vine continued to quietly crawl forward.

In the surrounding forest, more green vines slowly crawled through the grass and trees, surrounding this lively place.

A deer was lowering its head to eat the fruit that had just fallen from the branch.

At this moment, a thick green vine quietly crawled past it. The dense green leaves gently brushed past its thigh.

However, it did not sense anything.

When it finished eating the fruit and raised its head to leave, the thick green vine wrapped around its limbs with a whoosh\!

The deer was shocked and jumped up, preparing to escape\!

However, it fell to the ground with a bang.

The green vine continued to wrap around it, instantly wrapping its entire body tightly and tightly\!

The deer widened its eyes and opened its mouth, letting out a terrified cry.

However, no one could hear this sound in the lively and noisy forest.

There were monkeys and birds making noise on the tree and all sorts of small animals communicating under the tree. They ate a sumptuous dinner and chatted about all sorts of topics.

The deer opened its mouth, feeling helpless and desperate.

At this moment, the thick green vine wrapped around its body suddenly slid down its neck to its mouth and crawled into its mouth\!

"Pfft\!"

With a slight noise, blood suddenly splashed out of its throat\!

Then, the head of the green vine crawled out of its throat. Then, a bloody mouth full of sharp teeth was revealed\!

On its forehead, the green leaves swayed and a small sharp horn was vaguely revealed, like a sharp blade stuck in there.

It was covered in blood\!

It shook its head and the green leaves swayed. Another green scale was revealed\!

It turned out that its true body was actually hiding in those dense green leaves\!

The green leaves seemed to grow out of their bodies, making them look like thick green vines.

The forest was full of green vines. Who would be vigilant?

They devoured the flesh and continued to surround the small animals that were holding the banquet.

A faint smell of blood was quietly lost in the dark forest.

Chu Xiaoye's narrowed eyes suddenly opened.

He turned around and looked at the darkness behind him.

Those dark eyes flickered with a cold light in the night.

However, he did not see any dangerous figures.

When a green vine followed the dense grass and moved behind the elephant, the little elephant that was eating fruits subconsciously took a step back and stepped on its head.

The green vine immediately trembled and started to twist its body with all its might.

When the little elephant, who was immersed in the food, sensed the abnormality and turned around to look, the green vine had already stopped twisting and struggling.

Its head was flattened.

Its flesh was badly mutilated and it died\!

The sharp horn on its forehead happened to be tilted at this moment and was stepped into the mud by the small elephant's thick and heavy foot.

The little elephant looked left and right, then raised its foot to look again. Then, it continued to lower its head and eat.

At this moment, another green vine followed the dead green vine corpse and quickly crawled behind the small elephant, preparing to take revenge for its companion.

It did not provoke the few thick elephant legs.

It knew that this strong animal could not be defeated by entanglement.

It stopped behind the little elephant and slowly straightened its head. Then, it raised its body and quietly rose behind the small elephant's butt. 

A sharp horn appeared on its forehead\!

The little elephant was eating and wagging its tail happily, revealing the softest part at the back.

It decided to crawl in and open its stomach\!

Just as its head that was flickering with a cold light slowly rose and was about to approach the place of life, the small elephant's tail suddenly curled up. With a bang, a large amount of black feces suddenly surged down from behind like a flood\!

"Bam\!"

The green vine was smashed to the ground\!

Before it could raise its head to dodge, feces rumbled and rolled down endlessly. In an instant, it was buried at the bottom. Its mouth and nose were blocked and it suffocated to death\!
