Chapter 25: A Bloody Dusk

 "Whoosh\!"

The female lions, who were running as if they were flying, pounced towards the gnu\!

Soon.

The gnu fell to the ground.

The male hyena, who was spying on them, was extremely excited. Just as it was about to run around and shout for its friends, a figure suddenly jumped out from the grass beside it\!

He was as fast as lightning\!

Those sharp fangs shone with a white and cold light under the evening sun\!

Before the hyena could react, the figure suddenly pressed down on its back like a mountain\!

At the same time, the sharp fangs instantly pierced through the spine behind its head\!

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

Chu Xiaoye actually cracked its spine in one bite\!

The male hyena let out a scream as its body turned limp and it fell to the ground. It turned its head and prepared to bite with all its might\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and dodged.

The male hyena crawled on the ground, twisting its head and baring its sharp fangs. It looked at him in fear and pain, as if it did not know what was happening at that moment.

It struggled to stand up but suddenly realized that its entire body was like mud and it could not stand up at all\!

An intense pain came from his spine\!

Chu Xiaoye stood at the side with blood at the corner of his mouth, looking at it coldly.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei quickly ran over.

"Roar\!"

Seeing it lying on the ground, Little Curly Tail did not hesitate and pounced on it, biting its back\!

"Crack\!"

The spine on the hyena's back broke again\!

This time, it fell completely to the ground.

It wailed in pain, not knowing if it was begging for mercy or cursing.

However, Little Curly Tail did not show any mercy. He bared his fangs and suddenly bit its thigh\!

The male hyena twitched in pain, but it could not extend its head over. It could only lie on the ground and howl miserably.

Chu Xiaoye walked forward and suddenly raised his claw. He slapped it fiercely on the mouth\!

This slap actually broke one of its fangs\!

The male hyena's mouth was instantly filled with blood. It closed its mouth, felt dizzy, and let out cries unconsciously.

Chu Xiaoye looked coldly at Mei Mei.

Mei Mei's body was trembling. She was frightened by his glance and bared her teeth, but did not dare to go forward.

Little Curly Tail howled at her with a fierce look of disdain.

Mei Mei finally gathered her courage and pounced on it, biting the male hyena's butt\!

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail called out to her again, and as if he was demonstrating, and suddenly bit the male hyena's crotch\!

The male hyena's body trembled as its mouth grew wide. It widened its eyes and trembled in pain\!

It probably never would have thought that the testicle-biting skill the hyenas were so proud of would be used on it by a lion cub\!

It was already numb from the pain. Its body spasmed violently and it let out a desperate scream.

Little Curly Tail did not let go and took another bite at its abdomen\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

From afar, the cry of another hyena could be heard.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw only one. The hyena pack had yet to arrive.

However, he did not want to waste time.

"Roar\!"

He called out to Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, then brought them away and walked towards the female lions.

At this moment, the female lions were surrounding the adult gnu, biting their prey ravenously.

They were too hungry.

Chu Xiaoye was also very hungry.

Hence, he wanted to bring Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei over to eat as soon as possible.

If the lion saw this, they would have to drool while standing helplessly at the side again, and wait for the lion to enjoy a sumptuous meal alone.

The male hyena lying on the ground widened its eyes and panted heavily, its entire body dripping with blood.

It could not survive.

The lions did not eat it because they disliked it.

However, its companions would never mind it.

When its companions arrived, they would tear it into pieces and swallow it at their fastest speed\!

In fact, they would even treat it like they did with other prey. Before it died, they would eat its anus and make him die in pain\!

They would not even leave a bone behind\!

Was this retribution?

No, this was just to survive.

To survive, Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei and quickly rushed to the gnu's side and started eating.

The five female lions seemed to be a little shocked to see them, but they continued to bury their heads and eat.

Soon.

There was only a quarter of the entire gnu left.

The five female lions worked together and brought the remaining prey back to their newly designated home.

The lion had already returned and was lying on the hill, waiting for them with its stomach rumbling with hunger.

Seeing them return with prey in their mouths, the lion immediately got up and went up to them. With a roar, he snatched the prey from the lionesses' mouths and started eating.

The female lions put down most of the prey and left it for him to eat. They only brought a little back for Lars and Gigi to eat.

The lion needed enough food to stay strong and guard the territory.

Otherwise, never mind the young cubs, even they would not be able to survive in this place full of competitors.

The annoying cries of hyenas came from the grassland where they had just eaten their prey.

A pack of hyenas surrounded the heavily injured hyena and started biting it excitedly.

Blood splashed everywhere and his flesh was badly mutilated\!

The hyena queen had the right to eat first. She started eating from the male hyena's soft anus. When she was enjoying her food, she even stuffed her entire head in\!

The injured male hyena was not completely dead yet. At this moment, even its mournful cries became weak.

It opened its mouth and widened its eyes, motionless as it looked at its queen and companions sharing its body excitedly.

After a moment.

It died on the grassland and buried its bones in the stomachs of its companions.

Even the blood on the ground was licked clean by the other hyenas.

The hyena pack dispersed and continued to look for food elsewhere.

After eating their fill, the pride of lions lay lazily in the bushes, squinting their eyes and enjoying this short and beautiful time.

Beside the river.

The animals who had finished drinking water dispersed one after another.

A few animals struggled in the river, getting further and further away from the shore and gradually sank.

They never got up again.

A pool of blood floated up from the muddy river water and was quickly washed away.

The little animals standing on the shore watched everything in a daze.

On the grassland.

The vultures were circling.

The jackals were running.

The air was filled with all sorts of smells.

Further away, the blood-like setting sun finally fell.

In the bushes.

On that thick and solid Baobab tree, Chu Xiaoye was diligently doing all sorts of strange actions with the two little cubs.

Although this place was beautiful, he had to be careful and work harder.

He had to work hard to survive and grow up\!
