Chapter 314: Golden Claw Stealing Technique

"Roar—"

He roared angrily, wanting to scare away those lions and make those female lions remember his old friendship and strength and fall into his arms again.

However, no one bothered with him.

The lions stood at the border and looked at him with a murderous aura.

The female lions retreated to the back, their gazes cold and unfamiliar, as if they had long forgotten about him, the handsome and powerful golden-haired lion king.

Haas was furious and unwilling.

Suddenly, he saw some familiar figures.

Lars and the tall and mighty Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and some other figures he had seen in the enemy team.

"Buzz —"

Haas' body suddenly trembled and his mind was buzzing non-stop, almost blank.

Now, he seemed to have finally woken up.

It turned out that this was all a scheme, a huge scheme\!

Pit\!

It was all because of that little bastard\!

At this moment, the female lions and male lions suddenly took the initiative to disperse and open a path. They looked behind uniformly with respect and admiration.

Haas' body trembled as he gritted his teeth and looked over.

The young lion king that he had chased everywhere walked out majestically with its golden mane loosened\!

The female lions that originally belonged to him looked at this little bastard with infatuation and respect like how they looked at him in the past.

"Roar—"

Haas was furious. He bared his fangs, his eyes spitting fire, and his face was distorted.

His former politeness, gentleness, and elegance had long been thrown into that corner.

He was flustered and furious\!

"Roar—"

However, just as he roared, the hundreds of lions opposite also roared in unison. Thunder rumbled and resounded throughout the grassland\!

Haas' expression immediately changed and his legs trembled.

"Whoosh\!"

The ten-over lions following behind him did not greet him. They turned around and dispersed, fleeing\!

In the blink of an eye, he fled without a trace.

Haas stood in place, completely becoming a lone lion.

He was unwilling\!

He was furious\!

He hated it\!

He was terrified\!

He was hysterical\!

"Roar—"

He still had a ferocious aura and roared angrily\!

"If you have the guts, let's fight one-on-one and decide the victor\! Do you dare?"

Just as he expressed this meaning, his expression suddenly froze. He remembered that two days ago, this young lion king seemed to have just said this request in the forest.

However, he rejected it without hesitation.

"I told you that you would regret it. Look, is it now that your intestines are green from regret?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at him with a teasing gaze.

Haas' face was ferocious and his eyes flashed. Just as he was about to turn around and escape, Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked out of the crowd and walked towards him, looking at him pitifully.

"However, I will still give you a fair chance."

"Come, let's fight one-on-one and decide the victor\!"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and rushed up.

Haas was stunned at first. Seeing that the pride behind him did not rush over with him, he was delighted. His eyes flashed fiercely and he pounced.

This was his only chance\!

No matter what, he had to catch it\!

Winner takes all\!

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and suddenly jumped up, throwing a punch\!

"Bang\!"

An explosion\!

Chu Xiaoye's claws collided head-on with his fist\!

The two figures landed on the ground at the same time and took a few steps back.

Haas' front legs were a little numb.

Chu Xiaoye also felt that his feet were a little numb, but they soon recovered under the impact of the strange heat.

"Again\!"

Chu Xiaoye dashed a few steps, jumped up again, and pounced over\!

Haas was shocked by the strength of this young lion king and did not dare to underestimate it. He immediately jumped up and punched again with a whoosh\!

"Bang\!"

The two figures flew back again.

This time, Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that one of the crystal whiskers at the corner of the lion's mouth was flickering with a dazzling light under the sun.

He was not afraid but happy. With a whoosh, he flicked his golden claws and rushed up again.

When Hass saw this, the corner of his mouth curled up. He also flicked his claws and flew up.

"Clang—"

The two claws collided and sparks flew\!

Chu Xiaoye's sharp golden claw did not cut off the other party's claw\!

The two figures passed each other and stood in each other's positions. Their gazes met and their fighting spirit was high.

"Good swipe\! Again\!"

The two young lion kings pounced together again.

After a few more consecutive attacks, the attacks were all evenly matched and neither side won.

"Whoosh\!"

Another swipe was parried and sparks flew. Chu Xiaoye's claws finally grabbed the other party's body, and the other party's claws also grabbed his body.

Both sides did not dare to stop and quickly passed each other.

Chu Xiaoye's back was dripping with blood and his wounds were bone-deep.

Several bloody scratches also appeared on Haas' back\!

However, this golden-haired lion king's recovery ability was heaven-defying. With a sudden tremble, the wounds healed at a visible speed. It was even faster than Chu Xiaoye's saliva healing\!

"Roar—"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was shocked, Haas pounced at him like a figure faster than before with a whoosh. His huge fist was like a meteor that smashed down\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws to resist. A terrifying force suddenly passed through his claws and spread throughout his body.

He was sent flying\!

He flew for more than ten meters before he fell heavily to the ground.

His vision turned black and he immediately felt a sharp pain in his feet and his internal organs vaguely hurt. His entire body was almost broken by that punch\!

"Whoosh—"

At this moment, the golden-haired lion king rushed over again as fast as lightning\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that another crystal whisker at the corner of the other party's mouth suddenly lit up with a weak light\!

This golden-haired lion king actually leveled up again in the battle\!

Seeing the other party pounce ferociously, Chu Xiaoye knew that he could not care less about his dignity\!

Only the victor had dignity\!

The loser was not worthy of respect\!

"Boom —"

An explosion shook the grassland\!

Just as Haas pounced forward aggressively with the might of leveling up, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around, curled his tail, and stuck out his butt. He sprayed out a terrifying black smoke from behind\!

Before our golden-haired lion king, who had leveled up in battle, could see what was happening, it was suddenly sent flying by a hurricane-like airflow\!

At the same time, a terrifying stench instantly crawled into his nose, ears, eyes, pores, and entire body\!

"Ugh —"

He was still flying in midair when he vomited crazily.

Just as he fell to the ground, he was dizzy and his vision was blurry. He continued to vomit crazily, unable to find his bearings.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye pounced in front of him and suddenly pierced through his armor and into his neck\!

The intense pain woke him up.

However, the vomiting in his stomach did not stop.

His entire body felt limp and he could not resist.

When the terrifying black fog gradually dispersed, Little Curly Tail and the others and the pride behind them were shocked to discover that the golden-haired lion king that had just displayed its might had already been cut open\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw was still pierced into the golden-haired lion king's stomach.

He felt a stream of air leak out of the lion king's body and slip into his body through his sharp claws.

The deep wounds on his back actually healed quickly\!
