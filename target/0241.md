Chapter 241: Brother

Evening.

The battle finally ended.

The setting sun dyed the sky and the sea red.

Countless corpses were piled on the shallows full of reefs and the coast.

The enemy was completely wiped out.

However, there were no cheers of victory on the shore.

The corpses of their companions, family, and teammates were mixed with the corpses of the enemy. They could no longer tell the difference in flesh.

War was cruel.

For animals, life was difficult and precious.

However, in order to survive the next generation and guard their territory, they had no choice but to fight with their lives.

Everyone quietly dug the cave and dragged in the corpses of their companions that could still be distinguished. They let them be buried under the thick ice forever, hiding on the ground they had exchanged their lives for.

As for the enemy's corpses, they were naturally brought away and placed in the icehouse as military food.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the ground, chewing the flesh of a strange fish with his mouth full of blood. He ate tastelessly to fill his hungry stomach.

Catherine squatted silently behind him. Just like him, she was quietly eating the strange fish corpse on the ground.

Almost all the animals from the grassland died here.

They had strong combat strength and abundant combat experience on the grassland, but after coming here, they lost all their advantages.

They could only rely on their sharp teeth to fight.

The other party was too proficient, larger than them, and had sharper teeth. They were no match for the other party.

However, this group of animals that had struggled to survive on the grassland and fled when they encountered a little danger did not escape in the battle with a huge disparity in numbers just now.

They guarded here with their lives and did not retreat a single step.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye felt a great spirit being branded in his heart for the first time.

For his home, he risked his life\!

Here, they were all heroes.

Tilly walked to his side, raised her claws, and rubbed his head, as if she was comforting him or praising him.

However, he did not need any of this.

"Bam\!"

Therefore, he slapped it away.

Tilly lay on the ground and raised her head to look at the sea in front of her.

A huge white lion that was even larger than a water buffalo walked over from the sea with a group of white lions and looked at her in surprise and strange.

Tilly stood up from the ground and turned her head to look elsewhere.

She seemed to have forgotten Chu Xiaoye's slap.

Kakib's gaze fell from her to the young lion.

He knew this young lion.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye knew him too.

It was him. Back then, he had gone to the grassland to inform him to wait for the summoning of the snow mountain.

It was also him who had blocked the nearly twenty-meter-long giant sea python king with his own strength.

There were two shining crystal whiskers by the mouth of this white lion.

Obviously, his strength was extremely terrifying.

Chu Xiaoye looked at this majestic and powerful lion with a burning gaze. His blood immediately surged. He felt that one day, he would definitely be like him, mighty and domineering\!

This was a true lion king\!

Kakib went ashore and walked in front of Tilly. He lowered his head and rubbed her head affectionately. He looked at her gently and let out a strange sound, as if he was asking something.

Tilly turned her head and ignored him.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly shocked. The identity of this female cub was indeed not simple.

Kakib whispered to her patiently for a while. Seeing that she was a little impatient, he raised his head helplessly and turned to look at Chu Xiaoye. He stared at his eyes and the golden fur on his neck, looking at it carefully, as if he knew him for the first time.

Chu Xiaoye was a little flustered.

He did not know what relationship this person had with the female cub. He must have seen him slap the female cub to the ground just now. Would he stand up for the female cub?

Kakib sized him up deeply for a long time before walking over and looking down at him. He was not overbearing and took the initiative to extend his claws to show his friendliness.

Chu Xiaoye also raised his claws and clashed with his claws that were larger than his head.

Kakib stared at the golden claw that was curled under his feet with a burning gaze, then at the golden fur on his neck. His light blue eyes revealed a pondering expression.

He lowered his head and let out a low growl unique to lions. It was slow and gentle, and it did not seem to come from the mouth of such a mighty and domineering lion.

"I'm Tilly's brother. It's good to see you again."

Chu Xiaoye easily understood what he meant and cursed in his heart. If it was her brother, he was doomed. If his sister was bullied by others, a brother would usually return the favor twice.

The loud cry of a snow eagle suddenly came from the sky.

Kakib raised his head and looked at the snow eagle, as if he could know something from its cry and flying posture.

He turned around and looked at the white lions behind him.

Without needing any instructions, the lions left in a hurry, knowing what to do.

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned to look at Catherine and gestured for her to leave.

If he did not leave now, when would he leave?

Since the danger from the sea had been resolved, they should leave the snow mountain and return to the grassland.

During this trip to the snow mountain, they had killed many enemies and should have obtained many merits. If they left now, no one would say anything.

Furthermore, he could not stay here for long.

He looked fearfully at the powerful white lion and immediately prepared to leave with Catherine.

However, he had just taken a few steps when he saw the little white lion's figure flash and stop in front of him.

Tilly stood in front of him and raised her right claw, revealing her golden claw. She looked at him deeply.

She seemed to be saying, "We're all golden claws. Do you know what this means?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her golden claw, not understanding.

Tilly lowered her claws and took a few steps closer, almost touching his head.

"It means that we have the same mutated substances in our bodies. Coincidentally, I know where these substances come from. Don't you want to continue possessing them and become stronger?"

Tilly raised her claws and fiddled with the golden fur on his neck. She looked at him sincerely.

"At least, we should make your fur the same color, don't you think?"

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he looked at her with a burning gaze.

Of course, he did not want to be non-mainstream like this forever.

If they all turned golden, although it would be too ostentatious, at least they would be majestic, domineering, handsome, and charming. They would not be called trash.

He was tempted and looked at her in anticipation.

"Then, follow me home. We'll set off now\!"

Tilly turned around with a cunning smile.
