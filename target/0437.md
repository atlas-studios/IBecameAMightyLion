Chapter 437: Untitled

"Roar—"

A roar opened the curtains to the battle\!

Alisa took the initiative to attack. Her figure was like lightning and peerlessly fast. In the blink of an eye, she pounced in front of Chu Xiaoye and swung her sharp claws, her eyes shining with a cold light that was like a sharp sword.

At the same time, two crystal whiskers suddenly lit up at the corner of her mouth\!

"Pfft—"

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

However, to the surprise of this confident lioness, the battle started and ended quickly.

In a moment, the intense sounds of battle had quietened down.

The members of the pride were stunned in place and almost did not see anything.

The black smoke that enveloped the entire battlefield started to slowly dissipate, revealing the two figures inside.

Alisa was vomiting on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye was riding on her in a conqueror's posture. His claws were pressed against her neck and his tail was slapping her butt. He raised his head and stuck out his chest, showing off\!

Such an outcome and situation did not have any suspense for the members of the pride. Therefore, everyone was not surprised. After looking at it a few times, they dispersed and continued to rest.

Alisa had lost. She had lost miserably\!

Her powerful strength and will to win had yet to be displayed when she was defeated by the extremely smelly black smoke.

Like dogs, lions had sharp noses.

Therefore, she lost.

Although she was already prepared for this hidden weapon, she was still caught off guard and it came without warning.

That despicable and shameless bastard even raised his golden claw a second ago and made a heroic appearance of preparing to fight her claws. But in the next second, he suddenly turned around and started to fart\!

How shameless\!

"Ugh —"

Alisa vomited and suddenly buried her face in the grass. Her body trembled and she whimpered.

It was over, everything was over…

No matter what, she lost.

She was filled with despair.

The night was very quiet, as if she could hear the helpless cry in her heart.

She would rather die\!

No\! She did not want to die.

He still had hope if he lived, but if he died, there would be nothing but humiliation and jokes.

She could not die.

Alisa slowly raised her head, her eyes filled with tears.

Perhaps these were tears of despair, perhaps tears of fear, or tears of humiliation. However, to be honest, these were actually tears from the stench.

It was really smelly and stinging to the eyes\!

"Shameless\!"

Alisa turned her head and glared at the bastard still riding on her back, tears rolling down her face.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He let go of his claws and jumped down from her body. He faced her head and did not show any mercy because of her tears. He expressed his intentions very honestly. "Then, according to the previous agreement, This King is going to start, okay? There's no time like the present\!"

Alisa suddenly stood up, bared her fangs, and trembled as she glared at him angrily. "You're shameless\!"

Chu Xiaoye grinned, raised his claws, and tidied the crystal whiskers on her mouth.

"If you're willing to bet, you'll admit defeat. You lost, right? As for whether I'm shameless or not, let's not talk about it now. Let's only talk about what you said previously. Does that count? You took the initiative to challenge me and said that if you lost, you would let me deal with you, right?"

Alisa trembled and stared at him intently. After a long silence, she suddenly lowered her head and lay on the ground, burying her face in the grass. Then, she curled her tail and did not move.

"I, Alisa, will never forget today's humiliation\! Despicable and shameless bastard, just you wait\! Just you wait\!"

Alisa's face was covered in tears as she shouted in her heart.

However, after waiting for a long time, there was no humiliating torture and no movement beside her.

Alisa trembled and raised her head. Her vision was empty. She turned around and looked around, but she still did not see the despicable and shameless figure.

Suddenly, she raised her head and looked at the tree above her.

The figure stood on the tree, facing the bright moonlight and looking at the distant grassland. It did not move, and no one knew what it was thinking.

Alisa was stunned for a moment before she slowly stood up and raised her head, looking confused.

"What's wrong?"

He clearly coveted her body and had ill intentions towards her. He drooled and thought about her day and night, but why did he not get what he wanted now?

Could it be that he really could not do it?

At the thought of this possibility, Alisa, who was filled with despair and anger, suddenly wanted to jump for joy\!

Nothing could make her more excited and happy than this fellow wanting but not being able to.

"Damn eunuch\!"

Alisa opened her mouth and almost laughed out loud.

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye, who was standing on the tree, suddenly lowered his head to look at her, his eyes filled with ridicule.

"Don't be anxious. When we reach the grassland, this King will conquer a new territory and have his own home. This King will naturally make you bow down and lie on the ground as a concubine\! The bet today will be settled in the future. Just you wait."

The excitement and happiness in Alisa's heart immediately disappeared. Her cracked mouth and delighted expression suddenly turned to panic and fear.

"Of course, if you can't wait, we can do it tonight."

Chu Xiaoye turned around, narrowed his eyes, and opened his mouth, looking like he wanted to come down and find her.

Alisa's body trembled and she hurriedly took a few steps back. She shook her head in hatred and fear. "No, I… I can wait."

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and flicked them out. He looked at her teasingly. "Then, you won't forget this bet, right?"

Alisa raised her head with anger. "I admit defeat\! Of course I won't forget\!"

At the same time, she was secretly delighted. It would be better if she could stall for a few days. At most, she would escape\! No matter how powerful this bastard was, he could forget about chasing her\!

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flashed. He turned around and ignored her, continuing to look at the grassland at the foot of the mountain.

His mood tonight had passed and he could not force it.

Furthermore, there were many eyes peeping around.

Has everyone dispersed?

No.

Chu Xiaoye looked down. Mei Mei, Molly, Catherine, the Chino brothers, and even the Jiela sisters, the cold father, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur and the others were secretly hiding in the surrounding bushes to peep.

They seemed to have long known his intentions towards this lioness and were waiting to watch the show.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye felt that it was not a good thing that his subordinates had increased their intelligence. The flames of gossip were burning\!

Therefore, there was no hurry. He would consider this carefully when he went down the mountain tomorrow, conquered territory, and built a new territory.

At that time, as a lion king with territory and tribe, he would have no reason to retreat.

Just like an emperor who had just ascended the throne, even if he was not in a hurry, his subordinates would be.

Furthermore, at that time, he would have more choices.

Even if…

"Roar…"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the big tree beside him. The female leopard in heat was twisting her waist again, showing off her good figure with a fawning expression.
