Chapter 71: I Was Wrong

This saber…

No, were these claws so sharp?

Chu Xiaoye looked at his claws with eyes full of shock and was caught off guard.

He only wanted to scratch a few deep bloodstains on the python's head and slowly play it to death. However, he did not expect to cut its head off with a single claw\!

The tip of the claw was only about a centimeter in gold. It did not seem to be only on the surface. Instead, it seemed to have undergone a qualitative change from the inside out.

Just this little golden claw was enough to erupt with such terrifying strength\!

At that time, if his entire claw turned golden, wouldn't he be able to pierce through all the animals?

Even those bodies with thick skin, thick armor, or thick fur could not withstand a single blow\!

Ha\!

Golden right claw\!

"Roar —"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was looking at his right claw and sketching his future as a lion king in his mind, the little leopard that had escaped suddenly let out a roar and jumped up the tree with a whoosh\!

Her movements were so fast that it left people speechless\!

It was as if she had seen something even more terrifying than the python\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up in shock.

The little leopard climbed onto the highest branch and lowered its head. It bristled and bared its fangs at him. It roared and pretended to be fierce despite being secretly scared.

It seemed to be saying, "Big fart\! Don't come over\! Be careful that this leopard will bite you to death\!"

Belita was panicking.

Not only did this little cub know how to let out smelly farts, it also knew how to put on a terrifying stench. Now, it had actually grabbed the python's head off with one claw\!

He was a pervert\!

Perverted lion\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"Go away\! Go away\!"

Her cries were trembling and her body was trembling, as if she was saying this.

Chu Xiaoye was instantly unhappy\!

This ingrate\!

I just saved you\!

He was already preparing to leave, but now, he was not leaving\!

Not only was he not leaving, he was also going to climb up the tree and let her eat another big fart\!

"Roar\!"

"Ingrate Leopard\! Wait for me\! I'm here\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out and prepared to climb the tree.

Belita was terrified. She hurriedly grabbed a few leaves with her claws and threw them at him. As she threw them, she howled.

She was like a young lady who had encountered a gangster shouting, "Ah\! Don't come over\! Don't come over\!"

Chu Xiaoye had just climbed up the tree when the cries of hyenas suddenly came from the forest not far away. They seemed to be running towards him.

At the same time, the grass swayed and a leopard ran over in a hurry with a black antelope in its mouth.

She quickly ran under the tree here and prepared to climb up the tree. However, she saw the dead python under the tree and was shocked. She hurriedly raised her head and looked up the tree.

Her daughter was hiding on the tree.

However, just as she raised her head, she saw the cub hanging on the trunk of the tree.

That was not an ordinary cub\!

This cub was their nightmare\!

He knew how to climb trees, launch sneak attacks, hunt, kill hyenas, and even make the neighboring pride flee in panic\!

She was afraid\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

When the little leopard saw that her mother had returned, she immediately cried out excitedly and aggrievedly, as if she was complaining.

The female leopard immediately bared her fangs and roared at Chu Xiaoye, who was on the tree. She made a threatening expression and movement.

It seemed that this cub wanted to hurt his daughter\!

Although she was afraid, she would never shrink back\!

She had to protect her daughter\!

At this moment, two female hyenas ran out of the forest. They drooled and ran over excitedly.

The female leopard was in a difficult position.

She immediately turned around and bared her fangs at the hyena, letting out a threatening roar.

However, the two female hyenas did not fall for her trick at all. They ran over and pounced on her.

They were not afraid of leopards\!

The female leopard immediately cowered. She turned around and ran\!

However, she did not dare to run far.

She looked up at her daughter on the tree, terrified.

She could abandon the prey, but she could not abandon her daughter\!

Just as the two hyenas were about to pounce on the black antelope on the ground excitedly, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down from the tree and rushed over\!

This pair of female hyenas were members of the hyena pack during the day\!

Whether it was their scent or appearance, as a lion, he remembered them clearly\!

He would not be soft-hearted towards these despicable and cunning enemies\!

The two female hyenas clearly recognized him as well. They were shocked to see him pounce over, but then they realized that he seemed to be the only cub here and that there were no other adult lions.

The temptation of prey made them greedy and cruel\!

They immediately bared their white fangs and pounced over\!

When enemies fought, they were exceptionally fierce\!

The female leopard stood in the grass not far away and watched this scene with a burning gaze.

She felt that this cub had gone crazy\!

If he was too confident, he would only die prematurely\!

Although he had killed hyenas in the past, he had always attacked while they were not paying attention.

But now, he had abandoned his advantage and faced the enemy head-on.

The hyenas' bite strength was astonishing. There were another two adult female hyenas. How could he, a young cub, resist them?

"Whoosh\!"

Just as the two sides were about to collide, the cub suddenly jumped up and jumped over the backs of the two female hyenas\!

At the same time, the female leopard suddenly saw a strange golden light flash from the cub's claws and slash across the back of a female hyena\!

It was extremely fast\!

The cub landed on the ground and stood behind the two female hyenas.

A female hyena hurriedly turned around and prepared to pounce on him again.

As for the other female hyena, its body turned limp and it fell to the ground\!

A long trail of blood suddenly appeared on its back and it started to bleed\!

Deep white bones were revealed from the opened flesh.

Its spine was broken\!

"Whoosh—"

Before the female hyena that had turned around could react, the cub suddenly rushed up again\!

The female hyena hurriedly opened her mouth, revealed her sharp fangs, and bit down fiercely\!

"Whoosh\!"

Another golden light flashed\!

It was extremely fast\!

The female hyena's open mouth suddenly fell to the ground\!

The leopard and her daughter :"…"

Blood sprayed\!

The miserable cries of the two hyenas rang out miserably in the quiet night\!

The cub raised its right claw and wiped its bloody claw on the grass. Then, it walked in front of the black antelope and started biting.

He bit a bloody thigh and left elegantly.

Before leaving, he even raised his head and looked threateningly at Belita on the tree.

"Wu…"

There were no longer any roars in Belita's cries, only trembling cries…

It was as if she was saying, "I was wrong…"
