Chapter 311: One-on-one?

"Boom\!"

Thunder rumbled and a rainstorm poured.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team into the forest and immediately instructed Mei Mei and Molly to bring the twenty-over lions towards the river below and let them leave along the river.

The mission to lure the enemy deep had been completed.

The twenty-over lions were not suitable for survival and hiding in this forest. Therefore, they had to leave as soon as possible.

At this moment, regardless of whether the golden-haired lion king had already discovered his plan, it was already too late.

However, the other party might fly into a rage out of humiliation and continue to chase after him.

He brought Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and Tilly and continued to roar as they ran up. This was to attract the enemy's attention and make Mei Mei and the others retreat more safely.

"Roar—"

An angry roar sounded in the forest.

The golden-haired lion king indeed brought the pride and chased into the forest.

The other party's actions were clearly not just anger and impulse.

Perhaps the golden-haired lion king thought that as long as he was killed, his team would automatically be defeated and they could still turn the tables.

However, the golden-haired lion king seemed to have underestimated his strength in the forest.

In the sky, dark clouds were dense and lightning flashed and thunder rumbled.

The rain pattered and hit the leaves in the forest, causing the ground to be muddy and raindrops to splash.

Chu Xiaoye and the other two deliberately slowed down, looking haggard and unable to move.

Haas brought more than thirty lions and rushed over in the rain with a murderous aura.

The other prides fell behind, feeling weak, tired, and hungry. They could not move anymore.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and saw that the dense pride seemed to have already entered the forest. Mei Mei and the others should have already reached the river. He immediately brought Little Curly Tail and the others and jumped onto the tree. He agilely climbed to a high place, but he did not jump. He looked like he was trapped on it.

Haas brought the pride and immediately surrounded them. He raised his head and roared at them.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye and the other two were like turtles in a jar and could not escape anymore.

"Roar—"

Haas immediately let out a roar and summoned the pride at the back.

Now, he wanted to kill this king who had already been abandoned and lost all his pride in front of all his subordinates\!

Indeed, from the current situation, Chu Xiaoye had already become a pitiful worm that had been abandoned by everyone. His pride and warriors seemed to have abandoned him and fled without a trace.

The pitiful lion king was only left with his younger brother and the two female lions.

When all the members of Hasi's team surrounded him and raised their heads to see this scene, they felt sad for the pitiful lion king on the tree.

Of course, he was more gloating.

Although Haas felt that something was wrong, the situation in front of him was already very obvious.

This young king had already been abandoned by his team and could not escape\!

"Roar—"

He raised his head and roared. He decided to humiliate the other party before he died and wash away his previous humiliation.

"Poor king, where are your subordinates? Where are your tall and strong guards? Where is your father, your mother, and your pride? Why have they abandoned you? How pitiful."

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the tree and looked down at him, feeling pitiful.

Of course, he felt that the other party was pitiful.

Even though his intelligence had increased a lot after evolution, he was still an idiot in front of him.

Its walls were strong and clear, and it lured the enemy in deeply. It circled around on both sides and made a diversion. It attacked the nest and waited for the enemy to tire.

This military strategy looked simple, but it was too difficult for lions that had just gained intelligence. Even if they were given another brain, they would not be able to figure it out.

"Sigh…"

Chu Xiaoye decided to give him a chance and try his true strength at the same time.

"The king against the king. Fight one-on-one and determine the victor. Do you dare?"

Haas understood what he meant, but his mouth curled up and his face was filled with ridicule and ridicule. He mimicked his previous expression. "You want to fight one-on-one? Do you think I'm an idiot? You haven't even grown your fur yet. I, a dignified adult lion, am still wearing a golden armor. You actually want me to bully underage children. You're shameless, but I still want it\! I want to fight you in groups. What can you do to me?"

Back then, when he wanted to fight one-on-one, this kid was being shameless and insisted on beating him up. Now, he was returning a tooth for a tooth and returning a tooth for a tooth. He felt good\!

"Roar\!"

"Roar\!"

The pride behind him immediately let out a deafening roar, as if they were laughing at the young lion king on the tree.

Little Curly Tail was furious. He swung his tail and was about to charge down and start a massacre.

Was this group of trash worthy of mocking his brother?

Chu Xiaoye stopped him and lowered his head to look at the golden-haired lion king that seemed to have forgotten its manners. His eyes also revealed a hint of ridicule.

"You'll regret it. Soon, I'll return these words to you intact."

At that time, when this golden-haired lion king and his pride suddenly realized that their nest had been occupied and their cubs were captured, they would not even have food. At that time, how could the tired, hungry, and terrified them fight?

They could only be slaughtered and surrender on their knees.

At that time, this golden-haired lion king's only chance would be to fight the king alone.

Unfortunately, he did not grab such a good opportunity.

In that case, he could only do as he wished and beat them up.

"Bang\!"

Haas suddenly punched the tree he was standing on.

The tall and thick tree immediately trembled. The tree trunk let out a crisp crack.

The entire tree started to groan and sway.

The strength of this punch was mighty, domineering, and extremely shocking\!

The pride under the tree immediately let out excited roars and cheered for their king. Be it the lion or the lionesses, they looked at their lion king in golden armor with admiration.

"Is hiding on the tree useful? If This King punches you again, you have to come down obediently\!"

Haas looked up mockingly and suddenly smashed his fist at the tree trunk. His fist was fierce and sharp, bringing with it the sound of air being broken.

"Bang\!"

The tree trunk was smashed into pieces\!

The entire tree suddenly swayed violently and fell with a crack. It smashed the bones of the row of lions roaring and cheering under the tree into pieces and they died\!

The roars and cheers of the other members around immediately stopped\!

Haas' mouth twitched and he looked up.

Chu Xiaoye had already jumped onto another big tree at the side with Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and Tilly. They were looking at him encouragingly.

"Well done\! Continue\!"

"Roar—"

This young lion king in golden armor suddenly flew into a rage. Its golden fur stood up and it roared hysterically\!
