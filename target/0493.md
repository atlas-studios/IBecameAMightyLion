Chapter 493: Elven Maid

Annie ignored her.

Some jokes should be stopped and ignored.

She was very nervous now.

The halo of "Princess Annie" entered the palace, but the nobles in the palace knew that she was only an impostor.

All sorts of strange gazes and even malicious words would pounce on her.

All she could do was tolerate.

After leaving her fief, Vilis returned to her cold and arrogant expression. However, she was thinking hard about how to take the bald lion under her or her crotch.

The garden was huge and the scenery was beautiful.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not in the mood to explore.

He lay on the grass and basked in the sun for a long time, thinking about what would happen next.

Catherine lay beside him and looked at him quietly.

Wherever he was, there was grassland.

The huge castle was empty and exceptionally quiet. There were almost no other elves.

The Chief Swordmaster did not even have a servant and was indeed a little shabby.

After his initial shock and disbelief, Chu Xiaoye felt that this place did not seem to be much better than the grassland.

A country only had more than a thousand people left. They were also prepared to face the enemy's attack and slaughter at any time. They were probably not far from destruction.

Under the setting sun, the entire Elven City was bathed in golden sunlight, looking beautiful.

Chu Xiaoye, who was thinking about something, suddenly heard footsteps. He walked, stopped, and tiptoed over, seemingly hesitating.

Catherine's ears twitched and she opened her cold eyes.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. On the grass not far away, an elf girl who was even shorter than Vilis was looking over timidly. Her wide eyes were filled with curiosity, as if she wanted to come over and take a look, but also seemed a little afraid.

It seemed that she had never seen a lion, at least a bald lion.

Chu Xiaoye bared his fangs and deliberately frightened her.

The little fairy only widened her eyes in shock for a moment and did not turn around to escape.

She took a few more steps forward and introduced herself shyly, "Hello, my name is Kallia and I'm a servant of Lady Vilis. You're Lady Vilis guests, right? Can I go over and talk to you?"

Talking to two lions?

It seemed that the little elves of this city were indeed very lonely and bored.

To be honest, Chu Xiaoye was also very bored now.

He had been waiting since noon and was already starting to feel a little annoyed.

Since a little elf took the initiative to approach him, he would relieve his boredom and ask about the situation here.

He lay on the ground and extended his claws, hooking them at the little elf, as if he was a king giving alms. "Come over."

The little elf was very happy. She immediately beamed and ran over.

She had short silver ears and two sharp ears that were very striking. Her face was not as thin and long as that of other elves. Instead, she was round and chubby. Her blue eyes were also big and very cute.

She was wearing a blue and white servant dress and bright black leather shoes. She emitted a faint fragrance and her eyes were curved as she jumped around. She looked very lively.

"Brother Lion, why don't you have any hair on you?"

The little elf looked lonely. As soon as she came in front of Chu Xiaoye, she started chattering, as if she was no longer afraid of these two fierce beasts.

"Hehe, why does your hair grow on your body? Brother Lion, I should ask you this. Why aren't there any lion fur on your body? Did you deliberately remove it yourself, or did you not have it in the first place? I guess you deliberately removed it. That's cooler, right?"

Then, she turned to look at Catherine and said with a smile, "Sister Lion, are the two of you a couple? I heard that every lion has many female lions in the pride. Will you fight with other female lions? Does Brother Lion like you more, or do you like other female lions more? What are the two of you doing here? Does Miss Vilis want you to be her mount? Then, did you sign with Miss Vilis…"

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye finally could not help but roar and interrupt her.

This little elf was too talkative\!

He only cared about how happy he was talking, but he did not care about how others felt\!

He asked her to come over to ask her about something, not to listen to her vent her loneliness there alone.

Kallia was frightened by his roar and suddenly ferocious face. However, she quickly revealed a happy smile and said with a chuckle, "Brother Lion, are you deliberately scaring me? Annoying\! Let me tell you, I can scare you too\!"

As she spoke, she suddenly raised his two small hands and revealed his sharp canine teeth. She mimicked his cry and let out a roar, but it was childish, laughable, and without dignity.

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes and ignored her.

Just as she was about to turn around and teach her a deep lesson, clear and heavy footsteps suddenly came from outside the round door not far away.

Then, an elven man in silver armor and a wide sword hanging at his waist walked in with two palace guards.

The elf man was tall and had a striking scar on his face. His gaze was sharp like a knife and his body naturally emitted a cold killing intent, like a warrior who had been on the battlefield for a long time.

He brought the two elf guards through the round door and walked straight over.

Kallia was stunned for a moment before she hurriedly walked over and said, "Baron Olis, did Lady Vilis ask you to come?"

The elven man called Baron Olis did not look at her. He walked past her with the two elven guards and stopped in front of Chu Xiaoye and Catherine.

At this moment, a guard behind him stared at Chu Xiaoye and whispered to him, "Lord Lori should be talking about this bald lion."

Olis stared fiercely at the bald lion in front of him and said, "The two of you should be able to understand us, right? Let's go. Lord Lori wants to see you."

Lori had lost a saber-toothed tiger. Not only did he not perform in front of Vilis, he was also humiliated by her in public. It seemed that he was preparing to take revenge on the two lions.

"Baron Olis\!"

Kallia immediately chased over and blocked in front of them again. She extended her arm and said with a serious expression, "This is Lady Vilis' residence. They are her guests. Without her orders, you can't bring them away."

"Bam\!"

Just as he finished speaking, Olis suddenly raised his arm and slapped her childish face heavily, sending her flying. He said with a cold gaze, "Get lost\!"

Kallia fell to the grass. Blood flowed from the corner of her mouth and her face was pale, but she still quickly got up. She opened her arms and protected her two new friends.

"No, Baron Olis, I can't make way\!"
