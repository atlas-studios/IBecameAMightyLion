Chapter 96: Python

Maya was going to give birth.

Over the past few days, she had been a little restless, and her temper was also nasty.

She was exceptionally vigilant whoever approached her.

The corpses of the three wandering lions had already turned into three white bones that were piled conspicuously on the hill.

This not only scared the wandering lions in the vicinity but also the neighboring Seno brothers' pride.

They no longer dared to cross the bushes at the back.

Hence, Chu Xiaoye felt that the camp was very safe and suitable for Maya to have children.

However, this lioness was extremely stubborn and nervous. She instinctively wanted to avoid all living things.

Be it her king or her sisters, she felt fear and distrust now.

Of course, there was also the crazy Little Curly Tail.

This kid looked very unstable and liked to cause trouble everywhere.

A newborn cub was extremely fragile and could not withstand any dangerous teasing or movements.

Hence, Maya was very worried.

On a dark night, she quietly sneaked into the bushes at the back and left alone along the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye followed carefully.

He did not let Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei follow.

The current Maya was very sensitive and vigilant. If she discovered that they were following her, she might even suspect that they had ill intentions towards the children in her womb and might rush over to bite them.

A mother's instincts could not be underestimated\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to follow too closely. He smelled her scent and followed from afar.

Behind him, Catherine still followed quietly.

They passed through the bushes.

A rocky hill appeared in front of him. It was filled with weathered rocks and many hidden caves.

The dense and short trees and bushes made these caves even more difficult to discover.

This was still the territory of the pride of the cold father.

Therefore, normal wandering lions and other carnivores rarely visited them, which increased the safety of lionesses and young cubs.

However, nothing was absolute.

Callie gave birth here, and something happened not far from here.

Especially during the dry season when food was scarce.

Hungry carnivores would patiently search every corner of the grassland for a bite of food.

Under normal circumstances, lionesses would never get pregnant before the dry season arrived. It was not just because of a lack of food, but also because of the threats of all sorts of carnivores.

A hungry carnivore was even more dangerous than a lion.

However, Callie and Maya's children were dead and the lionesses in the pride did not have enough successors.

They had no choice but to take the risk and continue to produce offspring.

Maya stopped on a rock on the hill and turned her head, looking warily behind and around. She pricked up her ears and listened to the wind and grass around her.

Her dark eyes flickered in the night, and she could see very far.

Chu Xiaoye hid in the withered grass and did not move.

A moment later.

Maya lowered her body and quickly rushed into a patch of bushes, disappearing without a trace.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and did not dare to approach again.

Since he knew her location, there was no need to go forward anymore. It would be troublesome if he was discovered.

During this period of time, he decided to bring Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to walk around the area often to train and prevent those despicable hyenas from attacking again.

Until they returned to the pride safely.

Just as he was about to turn around and return, Maya's panicked and terrified roar suddenly came from the hill\!

The grass swayed violently and the stone fragments rolled down\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He no longer cared about exposing himself and hurriedly ran over at his fastest speed\!

When he ran up the hill, he was shocked to discover that the big-bellied Maya was actually wrapped around by a yellow python\!

The python was about six to seven meters long. It was thick and had a flat head. Its open mouth was filled with sharp fangs\!

These were not the common rock pythons here, nor were they other pythons. They vaguely looked like extinct giant African pythons\!

Chu Xiaoye had once read the commentary. This type of African python could reach ten meters in length with normal body size and weigh more than 600 kilograms. It was three to four times the weight of an adult lion and had astonishing lethality. It was the second-largest python in the world\!

However, they had long been extinct.

Although the python in front of him was extremely similar to an African python, it should not be that terrifying python.

Otherwise, Maya would have been devoured without even struggling\!

Time was limited, and he could not delay\!

Maya and the children in her womb were in danger\!

The python's thick body was slowly tightening\!

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and pounced forward\!

He did not attack the python's tail and body, but pounced directly at its head\!

Its sharp teeth and bloody mouth were a great threat to him and Maya\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

He swung his claw\!

The python's terrifying head suddenly turned to the side and nimbly dodged it. Then, it opened its bloody mouth and suddenly bit at him with a whoosh\!

It was as fast as lightning\!

A strong smell of blood immediately assaulted his nose\!

At the same time, a huge suction force came from the python's mouth\!

Chu Xiaoye was in midair and had yet to land on the ground when he was sucked into its mouth\!

His entire head was being sucked in\!

When Maya saw this scene, she was shocked and terrified\!

The python raised its head, and its throat quickly expanded. Two rows of sharp teeth immediately closed\!

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye's two front claws pierced into its upper and lower jaw with a "chi"\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and all his strength instantly surged into his claws. He used all his strength and pulled hard\!

"Bam\!"

The two halves of the python's mouth full of fangs were actually torn open by him\!

Even its throat was cut in half\!

Fresh blood spewed out\!

The python's body turned limp and its straightened upper body fell heavily to the ground with a bang, its entire body twisting and twitching violently.

Chu Xiaoye's head was covered in blood as he jumped up from the ground. He did not stop at all and rushed in front of Maya, quickly brandishing his claws\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The python's thick body was immediately cut into pieces by his sharp claws\!

Maya finally broke free\!

However, this pregnant lioness stared with her eyes wide open at the young cub whose face was covered in blood. She froze in place, trembling, and her eyes were filled with fear.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared at her, telling her to leave quickly\!

The python's body was still twisting violently. Even its broken thick tail was twisting and colliding everywhere\!

The vegetation around them suffered and stone fragments flew everywhere. It was still extremely dangerous for a pregnant lioness\!

Furthermore, who knew if this was the only python here?

What if another one suddenly appeared?

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, the grass beside them suddenly swayed\!
