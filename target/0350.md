Chapter 350: Untitled

The night was dark and the forest was quiet. Everyone slept to the sound of raindrops falling.

A night passed quietly with a drizzle.

When Chu Xiaoye woke up, the sky was already bright.

The light rain finally stopped.

However, the sky was still dark and the sun had yet to rise.

A fair, thin, and jade-like arm was placed on him. He could hear even breathing from behind.

Chu Xiaoye got up and turned to look. The little girl's face was red and the heat on her face had disappeared. Her breathing had also calmed down.

It seemed that her fever had subsided and the danger had passed.

She finally survived.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and walked out of the cave. He looked at the path on the hill. It was still muddy and he could not walk.

The vegetation around was messy from the rain, but it was still full of life. After careful observation, there were not many changes compared to before.

Chu Xiaoye was worried that the blood rain yesterday would bring even more terrifying changes to the plants and animals in this world. However, from the looks of it, it had yet to happen.

Everything seemed to be the same as before.

Chu Xiaoye stepped on the moist soil and walked up the hill. He tried to climb up and his feet slipped. If he encountered rocks, he might fall directly.

He could flick his sharp claws and grab, but not the other members.

It seemed that he had to wait patiently for two more days.

The little girl only woke up at noon.

After waking up, she smelled the fragrance of the deer leg beside her. She immediately crawled out of the fur, put on her dress, shoes, and socks, sat there, and started eating.

She seemed to be in good spirits and had recovered.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not know if it was the effect of his saliva or the blood rain.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly jumped down from the tree and wagged his tail. He jumped in front of him excitedly.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that this kid's once broken tail had actually grown out. Furthermore, it seemed to have become even longer.

If he straightened it, it was actually two meters long.

No wonder this kid was so excited.

It seemed that the blood rain last night did not change anything. Perhaps it was just a matter of time, or perhaps it only had an effect on some creatures.

The effect of the first blood rain was very obvious. Most animals and plants had changed in the blood rain.

As for the second blood rain, it was very likely that only the animals and plants who changed the most during the first blood rain or those with the greatest potential would be qualified to enjoy it .

Anyway, Chu Xiaoye could not feel the changes in his body.

Little Curly Tail jumped around happily and swung his tail around. After showing off in front of him, he ran to his mother's side to show off. In the end, he ran in front of the cold father to show off and even challenged his father arrogantly.

The cold father lay in the bushes and glanced at his tail sternly. He pretended to ignore it calmly, but he was cursing in his heart.

"This unfilial son\! Is he going to be unfilial again and abuse me? Damn it\!"

The cold father turned around and looked coldly at Aisha, who was not far away.

Aisha growled and let Little Curly Tail return.

Little Curly Tail was in high spirits and his tail was spinning behind him. He looked like he wanted to slap his father a few times before he was willing to accept it. Therefore, he ignored her.

Aisha could only turn around and call out to Chu Xiaoye.

Before Chu Xiaoye could react, Little Curly Tail immediately jumped away. He curled his tail and obediently returned to the bushes at the side to lie down. He yawned and closed his eyes.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him and could not be bothered with this kid.

He walked to Catherine's side and looked down at her dark eyes and claws. They did not seem to have changed much.

Then, he walked to Tilly's side to look at her claws.

Tilly, on the other hand, quickly lay on the ground and hid her claws under her body. She rolled her eyes and deliberately did not show him. She looked like she was saying, "I'm angry. Go away."

However, why was she angry?

Even she did not understand.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked in front of Mei Mei. He stared at her blue eyes for a while and subconsciously blinked to tease her.

"Come, girl, smile."

Mei Mei suddenly opened her mouth, her eyes curved, and let out a laugh, scaring Chu Xiaoye.

She really knew how to laugh?

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the little white lion. The corner of his mouth twitched.

Ever since this little white lion let out human laughter and looked like a human, he had been infected. Little Curly Tail was also infected. Now, even Mei Mei was infected\!

Were they going to become spirits?

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly walked to Catherine's side and leaned close to her head. He looked into her eyes and ordered her to smile too.

Catherine's face was tense. Her dark eyes trembled as she looked at him and did not move.

It seemed that there was another normal one.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and prepared to look for the Belita sisters.

However, just as he turned around, Catherine, who was behind him, grinned and her eyes gradually curved.

He was so close to her just now.

Not far away, Molly, who was looking over, was immediately frightened by the strange expression of this big sister who had always been cold.

When Chu Xiaoye found the Belita sisters, the two sisters were digging bird nests on the tree and eating bird eggs. Their mouths were filled with golden egg liquid and bird feathers, and they ate with relish.

Belia looked down and saw him. She immediately curled her tail, twisted her butt, and opened her mouth to reveal the bird egg inside. She looked at him fawningly.

"Eggs? I'll treat you."

"No, thank you."

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left.

When they returned to the cave, the little girl was cutting the deer leg with a small knife. She carefully cut it into pieces of meat that were as thin as cicada wings and piled them on a piece of fur that was cut off.

This deer leg had already been smoked. It was yellow and crispy. If it was wrapped in fur, it could be placed for many days without deteriorating.

If the little girl was hungry, she could take it out to eat at any time.

Furthermore, the taste and texture of this deer meat were much better than the bloody raw beef she had previously eaten.

When the little girl saw him coming, she immediately raised her head and looked at him with curved eyes. She smiled happily. She was clear, charming, and innocent, like a spring breeze that brushed past Chu Xiaoye's heart.

Look, this smile was the most comfortable and natural.

Looking at the little girl's innocent and beautiful smile, and then thinking of the little white lion and Little Curly Tail's ferocious and terrifying smile, Chu Xiaoye immediately had the urge to rush over and beat them up.

"Don't insult the smile in my heart\!"

The little girl picked up a piece of beef and brought it to his mouth for him to eat.

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes, indicating that he, a dignified lion, would never eat such trash food again.

I can eat it once, but never twice\!

The little girl stuffed the beef slice into the corner of his mouth and touched his sharp fangs with her little finger. Then, she used her sleeve to wipe the stains at the corner of his mouth and looked at him with her bright eyes and white teeth.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and could not help but chew this piece of beef.

"Hmm… It's quite fragrant."

Two days later, the ground was finally dry.

When the sun rose, Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

Climbing a mountain was a physical job, but it was also a technical job.

Stamina alone was not enough.

The cold father had already fallen a few times. One time, he rolled down the hill and almost broke his neck.

Fortunately, his muscles and bones were abnormal and he could heal himself after breaking them. He was fine.

Qiqi and Nunu were struggling.

Pit originally wanted to carry them on his back, and Little Curly Tail also prepared to wrap them with his tail and carry them on his back. However, Chu Xiaoye mercilessly rejected them.

Although this migration was difficult, they could train them on the way.

If they could not even withstand this little difficulty, how could they survive on the grassland over there in the future?

When any animal migrated, they would abandon those whose strength had weakened. They would never pity them, let alone help or wait for them.

This was nature's survival of the fittest.

The strong lived and the weak died.

An animal that lived by relying on its companions would not live long.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and waited patiently for the two little fellows.

Although Brother Flat Top was brave and had endurance, he was also panting and extremely tired.

It had never walked on such a steep mountain path.

As for the little girl.

At this moment, the members of the pride of the cold father, as well as Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others realized that this small, weak animal was actually much faster than them when it climbed up the mountain.

They could only circle around many steep places, but this little girl grabbed them with her small hands and easily climbed up.

Although she was not strong and her endurance was poor, she could walk this mountain path with ease and looked much more relaxed than them.

Furthermore, this little girl usually walked upright. However, once she encountered a difficult place, she would become like them. She would land on all fours and climb. She was like a monkey.

At the thought of monkeys, they realized that this little thing was really like a little monkey.

They walked and stopped. Before they knew it, the sky had turned dark.

Chu Xiaoye saw that everyone was panting from exhaustion. Qiqi and Nunu clearly could not keep up anymore. He could only instruct everyone to stop and rest for the night.

They were only a mile or two away from the top of the mountain. They could reach it tomorrow, so there was no hurry.

The little girl sat on a rock and wiped the sweat on her forehead. Then, she took out the bag of beef jerky from her pocket, took a piece, and placed it in her mouth, chewing carefully.

Seeing that everyone was looking at her, she was stunned for a moment before she came to her senses. She hurriedly got up and started to distribute the beef jerky in her hand.

However, she was rejected.

No one liked to eat these little things that did not smell of blood.

Chu Xiaoye rejected again.

With so many eyes watching, as a lion king, how could he be too extraordinary?

The little girl was a little disappointed. She could only go back and sit down and eat by herself.

"Roar—"

Tilly suddenly let out a scream in fright. She jumped five meters high and jumped onto the tree.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that Belia had brought over a small green snake from somewhere and was twisting it in her mouth with all her might. As for her, she was chewing with relish, blood flowing everywhere.

She had deliberately come to scare Tilly. After all, this little white lion always flaunted the smelly stone on its neck in front of her\!

When Brother Flat Top saw the small snake in her mouth, he was eager to take a share.

Belia ignored it and jumped onto a big tree.

However, just as she climbed for a distance, her body suddenly froze. With a bang, she fell from the tree. Then, she widened her eyes, foamed at the mouth, and her entire body twitched.
