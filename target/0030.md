Chapter 30: Stay Away From That Pig\!

Taking advantage of the chaos.

Chu Xiaoye lay by the river and drank his water quickly.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also ran over hurriedly and lay down with him, starting to drink hurriedly.

The river water churned and water splashed everywhere.

Fresh blood rose from the bottom of the river and dyed the water red.

The female lions who had not quenched their thirst stood not far away, not daring to continue coming over.

Gigi was still trembling and did not dare to approach the river.

Perhaps they could not believe it. Why were the three little fellows so bold? And one of them had even dared to jump into the river to fight the crocodile\!

Even his mother, Aisha, did not understand why her child suddenly became so brave.

Of course.

Mei Mei's mother, Xi'er, could not understand even more. Her daughter, who had always been timid, was now bolder than she was\!

There were so many crocodiles in the river, but she still dared to drink water\!

She did not know that this was actually a form of trust.

A kind of blind trust.

Whether it was the current Little Curly Tail or the current Mei Mei, they were full of trust and admiration for Chu Xiaoye.

No matter what he did, they would believe him.

The lion, the cold father, stood at the back and silently looked at his son, who already had the demeanor of a leader. His eyes flickered with coldness and vigilance.

Not long after.

The river regained its calm.

The pride left and returned to the camp.

Lars's front limbs were injured.

However, from the way he walked, the bones did not break.

As long as he had enough food, he believed that he could recover after a few days of rest.

He lay in the grass, his body still trembling. The encounter just now was like a nightmare, making him feel lingering fear.

His mother, the lioness with a broken tail, lay beside him and licked his wounds, comforting him lovingly.

Lars looked up at Chu Xiaoye, who had already climbed up the tree. His gaze was complicated, as if he was a little ashamed and depressed.

As the elder brother, he was inferior to his younger brother.

He originally thought that he was about to grow up and was no longer afraid of anyone. A random lion's roar could scare other animals away.

However, he did not expect to almost lose his life today just because he went to drink water.

Today's lesson made him deeply aware of his arrogance, stupidity, ignorance and childishness.

He still had many things to learn.

The female lions lay in the grass and started to rest.

The lion continued to go out and patrol his territory.

The sky turned dark very quickly.

After everyone fell asleep, Chu Xiaoye climbed down from the tree and entered the forest at the back.

Although the forest was split into two by the lions on both sides, they were still very big.

Not only were there all sorts of short bushes and thorns, but there were also many sparse trees.

There were also many fruit trees.

At this moment, the branches of the fruit tree were already full of fruits and many fruits had fallen to the ground.

Furthermore, the vegetation here was still green.

This also attracted many small animals to come and look for food.

Chu Xiaoye went around the bushes where the poisonous bees were and arrived at an orchard.

This was where he caught the dried rabbits and fawn.

During the day, many large herbivores were gathered here, such as elephants, giraffes, and rhinoceroses.

At night, there were some small herbivores gathered here. There were wild rabbits, squirrels, antelopes, and so on.

This was the best time for him to practise his hunting skills.

Of course.

Danger was also everywhere.

Where herbivores gathered, there must be carnivores lurking.

However, this place was not far from the camp of the pride. Ordinary carnivores did not dare to approach.

Even if they came secretly, they did not dare to be too impudent.

Although he was only eight months old, he was not small anymore. Be it his agility or speed, they were not bad.

If he encountered danger, he could run away.

He did not believe that those carnivores would still dare to chase him to the pride's camp\!

Although his father was cold-blooded and heartless, he was still a great deterrent to other carnivores.

At this moment.

The moonlight was like water, and the forest was quiet.

The pitiful herbivores did not dare to make a sound even if they came to find something to eat.

They did all that just to survive.

However, on this grassland and in this cruel animal world, who did not want to live?

It was difficult to survive.

Even the lions at the top of the food chain in the grassland thought so.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and arrived at the orchard. He quietly hid in the bushes.

His dark and bright eyes were like infrared as they scanned everything in front of him.

A strong black antelope was eating sprouts on the grass not far away.

It was too far away and difficult to approach.

Furthermore, the black antelope was extremely fast and strong.

And he was very vigilant.

Even a lioness with superb hunting skills might not be able to capture it.

The difficulty was too high. He had to give up.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze continued to search the forest in front.

A huge forest pig with fangs walked out from behind a big tree and was eating the fruits that fell to the ground.

It was very vigilant.

After taking a bite, he raised his head and took a glance. If there was any movement, he would be ready to run away.

The pork was strong and delicious.

The smell after drying would definitely be not bad.

However, the distance was a little far.

Chu Xiaoye slowly stood up and prepared to go around the bushes at the side and approach the other party first.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out from the bushes beside the huge forest pig and pounced at it like lightning\!

The giant forest pig was frightened and ran away\!

The direction it was escaping in was Chu Xiaoye's direction\!

But.

Chu Xiaoye could not feel happy at all.

That was because the figure that ambushed it was covered in beautiful patterns. It was the female leopard that had previously brought her child near the pride's camp\!

She actually followed him here\!

She ran as if she was flying, jumped suddenly, and landed on the back of the giant forest pig. Then, she opened her mouth and bit the neck of the giant forest pig\!

The giant forest pig's head fell forward and it rolled on the ground. It struggled with all its might and cried out miserably.

The female leopard bit its throat tightly. No matter how it struggled, it was useless.

Chu Xiaoye was very depressed to see his prey being snatched away by this female leopard.

However, even though he was depressed,

He had to leave this place quickly.

Leopards and lions were enemies.

Lions often bullied leopards because of their size and numbers. They would also often snatch the prey that leopards had painstakingly caught and even kill their children.

Although leopards were afraid of lions, as long as they had the chance, they would take revenge and bite lion cubs to death without mercy\!

Hence, Chu Xiaoye had to escape quickly.

The leopard's speed was not a joke\!

Just as he was lowering his body and preparing to retreat quietly, the annoying cry of hyenas suddenly came from the forest beside him\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

A hyena quickly ran over.

The leopard hurriedly picked up her prey and ran towards a big tree at the side, preparing to drag the prey onto the big tree.

On the grassland, other than lions often snatching the prey of leopards, there were also hyenas.

The leopard was smaller than them and lived alone. It was most afraid of getting injured.

If it was injured, it would not be able to hunt and might starve to death in the end.

Therefore, when they encountered lions and hyenas, leopards would generally flee. Even if they had just caught prey, they could only give it up.

Fortunately, they were extremely good at climbing trees.

Therefore, every time they caught prey, for safety reasons, they would drag the prey up the tree and enjoy it slowly.

As for those shameless bandits, they could only drool as they watched from under the tree.

At this moment, just as the female leopard dragged the giant forest pig under the tree and was about to quickly climb up the tree, the spotted hyena ran over, drooling\!

The female leopard had the time to drag her prey up the tree.

However, to Chu Xiaoye's surprise, the female leopard actually decisively put down her prey and fled in a hurry.

The hyena was extremely excited. It did not chase after her again but ran to the prey and prepared to enjoy a sumptuous dinner.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and dashed out of the bushes with a whoosh\!

He was afraid of leopards, but not this hyena\!

Because his bones and blood flowed with hatred and courage towards hyenas, and because he had once killed a hyena\!

He was a lion\!

An awe-inspiring lion\!

He was not afraid of this dog\!

"Despicable dog\! Stay away from that pig\! It's mine\!"

He bared his fangs and pounced on it extremely ferociously. His face looked extremely terrifying\!

The hyena was stunned.

In the grass not far away, the female leopard and the little leopard were hiding there with dumbfounded expressions.

Thisâ€¦ This looks like a lion cub???
