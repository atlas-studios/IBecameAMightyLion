Chapter 207: Enemies Meet

They continued forward.

They entered the tunnel again and stepped through the water.

This time, there was no obstruction.

Obviously.

The ferocious rhinoceroses from before had already helped them open up a path.

Even if there were some ambushers hiding in the tunnel, they were frightened by the rhinoceroses and hid in a corner, trembling. They did not dare to come out for the time being.

After about thirty kilometers, light suddenly appeared in front of him.

They finally passed through the abdomen of the mountain and arrived at the other side of the snow mountain.

Just as he walked out of the cave, a cold wind brought with it the salty and humid smell of the sea.

It was already night outside.

However, as far as the eye could see, the entire world was snow white.

A cold silver moon hung in the dark night sky. There were no stars surrounding it as it guarded this cold and quiet night alone.

No, it was not quiet here.

In the distance, the waves on the sea slapped the reefs and stone walls of the shore, emitting rumbling sounds.

However, they could not see any creatures.

Didn't they say that there would be animals waiting for them outside the tunnel?

In the distant sea, densely packed islands were distributed. They were dark, like some huge ancient ferocious beast crawling on the sea, waiting for something.

The snow mountains were very high and there were many of them.

They towered into the clouds and the birds could not reach them. They were endless and had numerous layers.

They were like layers of majestic and strong barriers that blocked this deep and mysterious sea. Behind them was the lush, beautiful grassland filled with life.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked at the footprints on the snow.

There were many footprints and they were a little messy, but most of them were blown away by the cold wind and did not look good. He could not tell what animal left the tracks.

Chu Xiaoye followed the footprints and walked towards the distant sea with Catherine and Blue.

At this moment, a small white fox suddenly ran down the hill beside them and stopped in front of them, looking fearless.

Was this the responder and guide?

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and prepared to shake its claws to show his friendliness.

However, this white fox ignored him. Instead, it turned around and led the way.

Chu Xiaoye could tell.

As long as its fur was snow-white, it was considered a high-level existence here. Its status was noble and its personality was arrogant.

However, did this have anything to do with him?

He was here to help, to fight with his life, not to look at the situation\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye rushed in front of the white fox and aimed his butt at it, walking in front of it.

You show me your face, I show you my butt\!

Let's see who's more ruthless\!

The white fox was stunned for a moment before it immediately circled around him, ran a few steps, and walked in front of him.

After taking a few steps, Chu Xiaoye also ran a few steps faster and walked in front of it.

The white fox was furious and immediately ran.

Chu Xiaoye grinned. Competing in speed?

The snow here was not deep and most of it had frozen. His speed was not inferior to that of any land animal\!

"Whooshâ€”"

He immediately rushed out and ran in front of the white fox.

The white fox was clearly frightened by his speed and immediately froze in place.

Chu Xiaoye was very pleased with himself. He turned around and looked at it disdainfully. With a whoosh, he ran even faster and further.

When he turned around, he realized that the white fox had already turned around and walked in another direction.

Catherine and Blue stopped in place and waited for him loyally.

Obviously, he had gone in the wrong direction.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He immediately returned and ran in front of Catherine and Blue, but he did not look at them and quickly caught up to the distant white fox.

The cold wind and the waves roared.

The sea ahead was getting closer and closer.

At this moment, neat footsteps suddenly came from the road beside him.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw another white fox walking over with a group of spotted hyenas. It seemed to be in the same direction as them.

The hyenas were taller and stronger than before. They were much larger than the male leopard, Bru. They were almost as big as the mutated Chino brothers and looked even more ferocious.

There were more than thirty of them.

Under the hyena queen's lead, they followed neatly behind the small white fox. They were quiet and did not make any sound.

When the spotted hyenas saw Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, they were clearly stunned. Their gazes suddenly turned cold.

Although they did not know each other, lions and hyenas were eternal enemies.

You kill me, I kill you. It will never stop for generations. Every hyena and every lion's bones flowed with hatred for each other.

When enemies met, their eyes would naturally turn red.

An icy killing intent spread among the hyenas.

The tall hyena queen narrowed her eyes and moved the corner of her mouth, as if she wanted to bare her fangs. In the end, she endured it.

In her tribe, more than a hundred members had died to lions in a year.

If not for the little hyenas growing up and their members reproducing quickly, and the addition of the other wandering hyenas, their tribe would have long ceased to exist.

Therefore, she was filled with hatred for any lion.

Usually, on the grassland, as long as she encountered lone lions, even if they were strong adult lions, she would call for her subordinates to attack them together until she killed them.

Now, seeing this young lion and lioness, she could not help but want to kill them.

However, not now.

The white fox brought them and stopped in front of Chu Xiaoye and the others.

The two white foxes walked together, seemingly communicating.

As for Chu Xiaoye and the other two and the pack of hyenas, they looked at each other coldly, as if they were communicating.

"Kid, you haven't weaned off milk yet, right? Do you know that it's very dangerous for you to run around like this? Perhaps you'll disappear one day."

The hyenas looked provocative.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the hyena queen in the lead.

When this queen saw him, her two front feet could not help but open, revealing the sharp claws inside.

Clearly, her mutation was not just her size and strength, but also her feet.

With these sharp claws, the hyena queen naturally had many more combat skills. Furthermore, she could even climb trees.

This was a hyena that could not be underestimated.

Her subordinates were clearly loyal and united. From the way they walked, they looked like trained troops.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the snow around him.

This place was bare. Other than snow, there was nothing. There was not even a tree.

Therefore, this became the best place for team battles.

If the hyenas fought here, they would have the most advantage in the terrain.

Chu Xiaoye did not show his golden claws, nor did he show any provocative expression like those hyenas.

He turned around and looked at the distant sea.

The hyenas thought that the young lion was afraid and did not even have the courage to look at them, so they became even more pleased.

At this moment, the two white foxes split up and continued to bring them forward.

Chu Xiaoye tried it while walking. His golden claws easily pierced through the ice under his feet.

As long as he wanted to, an ice pit would appear on the ground in a few seconds.

He could not be on the tree. Could he not be underground?

His current digging skills were not inferior to that warthog he had given the name Great Pit.

The cold wind intensified, causing the snow on the ground to dance and cover their vision.

The two white foxes still calmly led the way in front until they reached the coastline.

The sea was filled with black reefs that let out crisp and ear-splitting sounds under the slap of the wind and waves.

Thick layers of ice floated in the sea, like pieces of snow-white land.

Amidst the splashing waves, the two white foxes jumped into the sea and landed on a rock. They turned around and looked at the team behind them.

Obviously, they wanted to step on the reef and ride the ice to the island in front.

This was a good opportunity to attack\!

The hyenas looked at Chu Xiaoye and the other two.
