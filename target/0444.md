Chapter 444: Untitled

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail seemed to have not fought enough. He immediately jumped up and prepared to rush over to continue fighting.

However, when the lions saw their boss lying bloodily on the grass and being dismembered by the pride, they were shocked and terrified. They immediately turned around and fled again.

This time, they ran even faster and did not hesitate anymore.

The reason why they returned was because they were very confident in this powerful ancient bird boss. They thought that this group of invaders would kill their boss or chase him out.

Unexpectedly, their boss had already become the food of this group of invaders\!

It seemed that this group of invaders was more terrifying than they had imagined\!

If they did not leave now, when would they leave?

To hell with territory\!

After the ten-over female lions ran for a distance in panic, they suddenly woke up. The invaders had always only killed the lions and were always tolerant of the female lions.

Because they still had many uses.

The female lions stopped and carefully looked at the invaders who were eating. Seeing that the other party did not seem to be preparing to continue hunting them, they relaxed and walked towards the bushes not far away with an uneasy heart.

Their children were still hiding there.

Every territory on this grassland had not come easily. They could only guard the cubs and continue to stay here, waiting in fear for the arrival of this group of invaders and for the arrangements of fate.

However, until dawn, they did not see the terrifying invaders.

After a long time, they realized that the invaders had already left at some point in time.

When the sun rose, the grassland immediately became lively.

The zebras were running and playing. The gazelles were chasing and fighting everywhere. The coyotes were howling in the distance and the eagles were circling in the sky.

Chu Xiaoye left this territory with the pride and walked towards the river that came from the snow mountain in front of him.

At this moment, a noisy neigh suddenly came from the zebras not far away. Then, the zebras that had just been leisurely eating grass and playing immediately ran in panic.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and was shocked to discover that a huge moa had appeared\!

The moa ran extremely quickly and rushed into the zebra herd in the blink of an eye, walking side by side with a strong zebra. Then, its head tilted and its sharp and terrifying beak was like a cone. It pierced into the aorta on the zebra's neck with a puff and blood splashed\!

The zebra that was running in fear immediately neighed and fell to the ground in despair, blood flowing\!

It struggled with all its might, wanting to stand up, but it was useless.

The moa stopped in front of it and lowered its head to peck. In the blink of an eye, it swallowed the flesh on the zebra's neck.

The other zebras had already fled in fear.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay and immediately quickened his steps with the pride.

It seemed that the appearance of the moa last night was not a coincidence.

Presumably, there were many such moas on this grassland, and there might be even more terrifying things.

He originally thought that he had found a good grassland that was like a paradise. Unexpectedly, there were so many ferocious birds and beasts living here, and they were all ancient species that had long been extinct outside.

It seemed that it was not so easy to obtain a territory and survive here.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride through a new territory. He could clearly smell the pungent smell left behind by the lord in the grass, but it was definitely not a lion's.

Obviously, their status as former overlords of the grassland was no longer as glorious as before. They could only bow and beg for the protection of other ferocious beasts.

The title of the king of the grassland no longer belonged to them here.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a roar suddenly sounded from the grassland not far away.

Then, a huge monster with two horns on its head and fangs in its mouth ran over with a group of wild cows with a murderous aura\!

The monster was like a mutated wild bull. Its entire body was covered in armor that looked like fish scales. Two sharp fangs that were like ivory grew out of the corner of its mouth. Its eyes were red and it looked rather demonic and ferocious.

This wild bull was extremely strong and tall, being more than two meters tall. When it ran, its four hooves flew and its kicks were like thunder. Its round eyes and expanded nostrils made it look very angry and fierce.

Most importantly, it had dozens of strong wild cows that were also aggressive behind it\!

Never mind this mutated wild bull, the pride would not dare to provoke even ordinary cows on this flat grassland with nowhere to hide.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately ran forward with the pride.

This wild bull had already grown fangs and armor. Perhaps its current weapon was not just its rash collision and horns.

Chu Xiaoye had just stepped into this territory and the marking aura he smelled probably belonged to this wild bull king.

He did not expect that this territory had already been occupied by water buffaloes.

Ordinary lions or other ferocious beasts could not do anything to these hot-tempered big fellows.

The wild bull king brought the herd and chased relentlessly.

Fortunately, they were too big and could not run long enough. After chasing for a while, they gradually slowed down.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and was shocked.

Just as the wild bull king was running, it suddenly stopped in its tracks and turned around. The sharp fangs at the corner of its mouth pierced into the neck of a wild bull at the side. Then, it suddenly raised its head and the wild bull was sent flying.

The wild bull king looked very angry. It widened its nostrils and panted heavily. It walked in front of the wild bull that had fainted from the fall. It lowered its head and actually opened its mouth to eat\!

Chu Xiaoye clearly saw that two rows of sharp fangs were revealed in the open mouth. They were slightly shorter than the crocodile's fangs, but they were extremely thick and sharp\!

The wild bull king chewed the flesh in its mouth as it raised its head and looked at them, its eyes still filled with anger.

It could not catch up to the pride and had nowhere to vent its anger. Hence, it ate a companion to vent its anger.

The other wild cows following behind it stood there trembling. Although they were terrified, they did not dare to move. They were like lambs being reared and slaughtered by humans.

"Roar—"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was shocked by this scene, Little Curly Tail, who was beside him, suddenly let out an extremely excited roar. Then, he jumped up and widened his eyes, looking ahead excitedly.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly turned around and looked forward. His heart trembled and he was dumbfounded.

A huge tree that towered into the clouds and was as thick as a tree king came into view\!

The huge tree's trunk was extremely thick. It was probably impossible for nearly a hundred people to surround it. Even the branches on it were terrifyingly thick and thicker than the huge trees they had seen on the way for more than ten thousand years\!

The topmost part was covered by extremely lush leaves and branches. It really pierced into the sky. Even if he stood hundreds of meters away, he could not see the end\!

Chu Xiaoye even suspected that this super tree was probably more than 100 million years old\!

"It has become a spirit\!"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. Then, he suddenly became excited.

If he could take the territory of this super tree for himself, this would be the climax of a lion's life\!

He did not want much. He only wanted the territory of the super tree that was thirty square kilometers. He was not greedy.

The new territory of his dream was finally settled.

Chu Xiaoye could not restrain the excitement in his heart. He immediately brought the pride and advanced towards the super tree.
