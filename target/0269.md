Chapter 269: Winds Rise and Clouds Fall\!

"Unfilial son\!"

Under the gaze of everyone, the cold father lowered his head and did not move. He treated himself as a rock and the sadness in his heart flowed like a river.

Chu Xiaoye's speech was generally just one sentence.

"Defeat the enemy and protect our home\!"

The pride's blood boiled as they roared in unison, indicating that they were willing to follow and fight to the death with the enemy\!

Of course.

Before that, he had to solve the problem in front of him.

Two tigers could not share one mountain, and two kings could not share one land.

Now that the two teams were walking together, they had to choose a true king.

Otherwise, sooner or later, there would be a chaotic battle between them.

Most of the grassland was already occupied by the black lions. The place that could accommodate them was becoming smaller and smaller.

They had to unite in order to avoid conflict and war because of food and territory.

"Roar—"

The one-eyed lion king's roar finally had a goal.

He looked at the young golden-haired lion king with a dignified gaze and issued a challenge.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the cold father's back and patted his head to let him return to the team.

The cold father bared his fangs and wanted to roar to maintain his dignity as a lion and father. However, he was kicked by Catherine beside him and immediately lowered his head to return to the team obediently.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the one-eyed lion king and expressed his acceptance of his challenge.

Since they had already come this far, there was no need to hesitate and hide. All the problems could be resolved with the lion's claws and sharp teeth\!

They respected him as their king. Then, he would use his strength as a king to lead them and defeat all their enemies and competitors\!

He had to give them more confidence and hope\!

He had to let them know that although their king was young and handsome, his strength would never be inferior to that of any strong and ugly lion\!

The sea could not be measured, and a lion could not be judged by appearance\!

His young and tender face, handsome and dashing appearance did not mean that he was a weakling who smelled like milk\!

So what if he was an adult lion?

He was not afraid\!

"Roar—"

He roared angrily and expressed his ambition and aura as a king\!

However, before he could move, Little Curly Tail, who was behind him, had already swung his tail and charged forward bravely\!

"I'm my brother's claw\! If you want to fight my brother, you have to defeat me first\! If you can't even win against me, what right do you have to challenge my brother?"

Little Curly Tail roared angrily and jumped up, pouncing on the one-eyed lion king.

The one-eyed lion king stood in place and looked at him calmly. It did not move at all. It did not jump up or retreat, as if it did not take his attack seriously.

The moment Little Curly Tail raised his claws and swung them at his face, the one-eyed lion king finally raised its claws and faced him.

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

A huge force suddenly spread throughout his entire body through Little Curly Tail's claws.

Little Curly Tail could not help but fly backward and fall heavily to the ground.

The one-eyed lion king stood in place and calmly put away its claws. Its aura, which was as immovable as a mountain, was like that of a true king.

Little Curly Tail was furious. He immediately jumped up from the ground and pounced forward again.

This time, when he was about to approach the one-eyed lion king, he suddenly turned around. The curled tail behind him swung like an iron whip at the one-eyed lion king's face\!

The one-eyed lion king's pupils constricted and finally felt a threat.

When the iron tail whipped over ferociously, he lowered his head and dodged.

Unexpectedly, the iron tail was extremely agile. Just as he whipped it over, it suddenly retracted and slapped towards his right cheek again\!

The one-eyed lion king did not have the time to dodge and could only extend its claws to block.

"Bam\!"

A crisp sound\!

The one-eyed lion king immediately felt its body tremble and its feet turn numb.

He looked at the young long-tailed lion in surprise and thought to himself that this kid was indeed capable.

However, he had yet to use his full strength.

After Little Curly Tail succeeded in his attack, the iron tail behind him immediately swung with a whoosh. It was airtight and like a shadow, it enveloped the one-eyed lion king like a storm\!

The one-eyed lion king actually stood in place and did not dodge.

"Clap clap clap clap\!"

Little Curly Tail's iron tail slapped his head, body, and face\!

However, this ferocious slap seemed to have no effect on the one-eyed lion king.

The one-eyed lion king still stood in place without moving, as if it did not feel any pain.

One had to know that Little Curly Tail's tail had once broken the bones of a lion and broken a tree. Even a water buffalo could not resist it and it was extremely powerful.

However, the one-eyed lion king was still safe and sound after being hit by so many iron whips.

Little Curly Tail twitched and felt that something was wrong.

At this moment, the one-eyed lion king finally erupted. It suddenly swung its claws and actually wrapped around Little Curly Tail's tail. With a whoosh, it swung above its head and sent Little Curly Tail's entire body flying\!

"Whoosh\!"

He threw Little Curly Tail out.

Little Curly Tail fell heavily to the ground again.

This time, he got up from the ground and did not show an angry expression again, nor did he rush up. He only put away his tail and walked to his brother's side in shame to show that he was no match for him.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and patted his head, indicating that he had done very well.

This one-eyed lion king clearly obtained more opportunities and growth during that evolution. It evolved even better than other animals.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye believed that more animals had obtained greater opportunities.

In this world, there was never a lack of outstanding people and better people.

If you were strong enough and performed extremely well, you must not be careless and pleased with yourself because there were still more outstanding people that you had not encountered.

In this world, there was no strongest expert, only stronger.

Chu Xiaoye never felt that he was very strong because he knew that he could obtain opportunities and other animals could also obtain them.

However, they had yet to meet.

However, now, the one-eyed lion king in front of him was clearly a lucky person who had obtained a huge opportunity.

Under his dense fur was a suit of armor. His skin was dark gold with a luster. Every time Little Curly Tail's tail slapped it, the fur would spread and reveal the armor that had fused with his skin to resist any attack.

Therefore, Little Curly Tail's iron tail was useless to him.

And the strength of this one-eyed lion king could not be underestimated.

This was a tank with six god armor and was even wearing reverse armor. If an ordinary claw slapped it, it would definitely hurt. If he wanted to use his sharp claws to scratch, his sharp claws would probably be broken.

There was no doubt about Little Curly Tail's failure.

He could not underestimate any fellow who could gather a large number of his own kind. Since everyone was willing to gather beside him, he must have something extraordinary about him.

However, Chu Xiaoye would not be timid and admit defeat.

No matter how high his armor was, he was afraid of armor breaking, right?

His golden claws were not made of dough\!

He comforted Little Curly Tail and walked in front of the one-eyed lion king. He lowered his head very politely to express his respect for his elders and his intentions.

"Victory and defeat in a duel need not be determined by life and death. We are all victims of calamity who have been expelled from our homes. We should unite against the outside world, defeat the enemy, and reclaim our homes. There's no need to fight to the death."

To be honest, Chu Xiaoye felt that this one-eyed lion king was very steady and principled. He did not want to hurt the innocent. When he suggested the two to fight, he was not arrogant and had never forced or hooted.

Therefore, he did not want to fight to the death with the other party.

However, his attitude seemed to be showing weakness and admitting defeat in the eyes of the pride behind him.

Even the six lions behind the one-eyed lion king revealed disdainful expressions.

The pride behind them let out low roars of ridicule, their eyes filled with ridicule and pride.

"Is this kid afraid?"

"After seeing our king's strength, you started to admit defeat?"

"Since you're afraid of death, don't fight. Just bow down and hand the team to our king."

These noisy sounds made Little Curly Tail furious.

Catherine's gaze was cold as she bared her sharp claws.

The pride of the cold father were all indignant and looked at him angrily.

The pride behind him was even more furious. They bared their fangs and had fierce expressions. Just wait for this young king's order, they would rush up without care to protect the dignity of the king\!

However, Chu Xiaoye did not seem to have any reaction and still displayed a very friendly attitude. He even hoped that the one-eyed lion king would show mercy in a duel.

This made the pride behind the one-eyed lion king even more pleased.

"Our king is the true king. He won before fighting\! This young kid is a coward\!"

The one-eyed lion king did not show any pleased or careless expression. He nodded, indicating that he agreed with this suggestion. A duel only determined victory and defeat, not life and death.

Hence.

The atmosphere started to freeze.

The noise stopped.

The battle between the two lion kings officially started\!

Both sides had burning eyes\!

Chu Xiaoye knew that this one-eyed lion king would not attack first. After all, the other party was an elder. He still had to be humble.

Therefore, he did not hesitate and rushed up.

He jumped and pounced over.

This was the first move Little Curly Tail had used.

The one-eyed lion king still stood in place. It did not pounce or dodge, as if it was facing Little Curly Tail. It was very calm.

When Chu Xiaoye's claws slapped over, he raised his claws and faced them.

However, the expected sound of the two claws colliding did not happen.

Just as the two claws were about to collide, Chu Xiaoye suddenly seemed to have lost his strength and lowered his claws.

As for the one-eyed lion king, its claws were still slapped with strength.

He missed and leaned to the left with the strength of his claws.

"Bang\!"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's other claw suddenly whipped over and slapped his right cheek heavily\!

A huge force bloomed on the one-eyed lion king's right cheek\!

He was caught off guard. His body, which was already leaning to the left, suddenly tilted and he was slapped to the ground.

In an instant, his face was burning with pain. His mind was blank and he was a little stunned.

This sudden loud slap also stunned the six lion subordinates and the pride behind him.

This was naturally not despicable. It was a test of their reaction speed and intelligence in battle.

In the animal world, there was no such thing as despicable.

Victory was victory, defeat was defeat\!

Clearly, the one-eyed lion king's intelligence and reaction speed were defeated by this young lion king in the first round.

After a short silence, the pride of the cold father and the pride behind them let out deafening roars like thunder.

Chu Xiaoye raised his hind legs and kicked Little Curly Tail, who was so excited that he had forgotten how to secretly lick his butt, to the ground.

The battle was not over.

He had to make the other party accept him wholeheartedly, submit to him obediently, and become his subordinate willingly\!

The other party's pride thought that he was admitting defeat previously and did not dare to fight their one-eyed lion king to the death. Actually, he only wanted a tank and did not want to kill the other party.

What did he need the most when he started to dominate?

Naturally, he needed all sorts of lion talents\!

If he wanted to become an overlord, he could not be an overlord first. The Pei Gong, who cherished talent, was the role model he should learn the most.

"The wind rises and the clouds rise, the fierce warriors fight everywhere\!"
