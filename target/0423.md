Chapter 423: Untitled

The light rain at night brought more cold air.

The already damp and cold ancient forest became even colder.

Even the lions with thick manes were trembling in the cold. They could only hide in the bushes and lean on each other to get warm.

The female lions were also gathered. They leaned against each other and lay together.

Although the little girl had eaten a big smelly fart, she still wanted to snuggle up to Chu Xiaoye and spend the cold night with him.

Her raised face was filled with a pitiful expression and her beautiful eyes were filled with anticipation.

However, Chu Xiaoye stayed on the tree alone and did not come down. He even faced her with his butt and did not look at her, as if he was still angry about being played.

The big black bear squatted beside the little girl and looked at her pitifully with its small eyes, as if it was begging her to change her mind.

The little girl ignored it and sat down under the tree. The rain was dripping, and she let the cold rain run down her golden hair and into her neck. Her cold lips trembled.

She seemed a little sad.

Seeing that she was sad, the big black bear immediately lowered its head and eyes, looking very sad.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and clicked his tongue in wonder.

What charm did this little girl have that could make this big black bear submit to her and willingly serve her?

On the tree beside her, Belia started to go into heat again.

The little female leopard looked at him with watery eyes. As she twisted her butt, she treated the branch beside her as his body and rubbed against it, her face filled with charm.

Although Chu Xiaoye disdained to look at her, he was secretly pleased.

His charm was not any less than that little girl's\!

Look, even the female leopard had fallen for him and had been chasing him relentlessly, unwilling to give up.

However, he did not have the mood to do so now.

Even if he ultimately had to compromise with reality, he had to wait until he had his home and did not have to worry about food and drink.

They did not even have a territory, so why were they talking about mating?

"Roarâ€¦"

The female leopard in heat started to let out tempting cries without restraint. At the same time, she started to show her soft and beautiful figure with all her might.

Women danced for their favorite.

Unfortunately, this was all wishful thinking and wasted effort.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at her again. Instead, he climbed up higher. Even if he was drenched in the rain, he could not be bothered to see her self-indulgent and shameless performance.

"Idiot\!"

The cold father, who was hiding in the bushes and beside a few female lions, looked up at this scene and mocked in his heart.

So what if his unfilial son was powerful?

Without even the most basic instincts and responsibility of a male, even if he became a lion king, wouldn't the female lions that he had painstakingly recruited leave him?

The female lions joined the pride not only for food and territory, but also to reproduce and nurture their offspring.

No matter how loyal they were to this unfilial son, they would definitely abandon him in the end because they could not be satisfied. They might even work together to chase him out of the pride.

This situation was very common in prides.

"It seems that I have to go out to truly conquer the pride\!"

The cold father narrowed his eyes and looked at the Jiela sisters and the other six female lions not far away.

Although this unfilial son was unfilial, he at least had the strength to protect this pride. He had never thought of chasing him out. As a father, he could not watch helplessly as this pride dissolved.

Therefore, he was duty-bound to pacify the lionesses\!

There was no time like the present.

A long night would definitely result in many dreams\!

For the sake of the pride, he could not hesitate anymore. He would start taking action tonight\!

The cold father suddenly stood up and left Maya and Aisha's side. He raised his head and stuck out his chest, walking towards the Jiela sisters and the six female lions with a heavy burden on his shoulders.

This commotion naturally attracted everyone's attention.

The Jiela sisters' eyes were filled with confusion as they slowly walked out of the bushes.

The six female lions also walked up with the two sisters. They looked inquiringly at this pitiful lion that was always abused by his family and wanted to ask him what help he needed.

The cold father walked in front of them and without a word, turned around and faced them with his butt. He raised his tail and one of his hind legs and squeezed out some urine, releasing his powerful male aura.

At the same time, he revealed the place which bore the responsibility of the pride.

The eight female lions were stunned in place and looked at each other.

The cold father turned to look at them, thinking that they still did not understand. Hence, he turned around and walked towards Big Jiela, turning behind them. He prepared to start like before.

A lion was so domineering and direct\!

"Bang\!"

However, before he could raise his upper body and ride on her, Big Jiela suddenly raised her strong hind legs and kicked his mouth heavily\!

The excited little expression on the cold father's face was immediately smeared with blood. His head tilted and he fell to the ground.

Big Jiela turned around and looked at him coldly. Then, she left with Little Jiela and crawled back into the bushes.

If not for the king, she would have fought him long ago\!

Even if they were covered in scars and did not look good, they would never mate with a weakling\!

Every lioness liked the strong and wanted their descendants to inherit the best genes. They were naturally no exception.

Their most ideal mate was naturally the young and powerful lion king.

Furthermore, the rules of the pride were that the lion king was the first to have the right to mate.

Even if he was the king's father, it was impossible\!

Of course, the king would definitely not fancy them. If the king rejected them clearly in the future, they would naturally find another lion in the pride. However, it would definitely not be him\!

The cold father got up from the ground with his mouth full of blood. He felt angry and embarrassed, but he did not dare to be angry and take revenge.

He knew his limits. The ferocity of these two female lions was even more powerful than Xi'er's. He could not provoke them.

However, he would never give up like this.

For the future of the pride, he had to be thick-skinned and continue to bear his responsibility as a lion\!

The cold father raised his head and looked at the other six female lions.

However, the six female lions did not look at him much. They turned around and left behind the sisters. At the same time, they gave him a warning and cold gaze.

The cold father's expression was stiff. He turned around and looked at the other lionesses.

There were many female lions in the pride, but none of them seemed to be simple.

In the end, his gaze landed on the young and unfamiliar lioness.

This lioness was saved by that unfilial son. He casually frightened her that day and she joined the pride. Her courage and strength were probably not much.

Although she was still too young, she should have already matured and he could prey on her now.

After all, the little things nowadays were very mature.

The cold father opened his mouth and bared his fangs. He frightened her first before he perked up and walked over majestically with small steps.

Alisa lay on the ground and narrowed her eyes.
