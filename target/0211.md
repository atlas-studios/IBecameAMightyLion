Chapter 211: Terrifying Claws

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The cries of hyenas suddenly appeared in the forest in front of him.

To lions, this cry was especially annoying.

The mixed fur lion king did not hesitate and immediately ran over with the team.

When they came close, they realized that a spotted hyena pack was running around a cave, letting out intense provocations.

Outside the cave, a sea python had already been bitten to death and its entire body was covered in wounds from being bitten.

A few spotted hyenas were eating sea python meat in big mouthfuls.

From the outside, the cave was dark and nothing could be seen. However, dense hissing sounds came from inside.

Clearly, many sea pythons were hiding inside\!

When the lion king saw this, its eyes lit up and it was overjoyed.

He had searched far and wide for it but found it without any effort\!

The sea pythons in this cave were all his\!

The more the better\!

"Roarâ€”"

He immediately roared at the spotted hyenas, widened his eyes in anger, and bared his fangs. His entire body emitted the dignity and aura of a lion as he tried to make the spotted hyenas scram\!

There were about 30 hyenas in this pack. They were the pack that had come with Chu Xiaoye and the other two.

At this moment, they were surrounding the cave and provoking it with all their might. They wanted to force the sea python out so that they could obtain merits.

The roar of the mixed fur lion king frightened them, but it did not scare them away.

Under the hyena queen's gaze, all the hyenas looked coldly at the scar-faced lion king and the team behind him.

Obviously, they were not prepared to give up the merits they had obtained.

On the grassland, spotted hyenas and lions usually relied on their strength to snatch each other's food or even think of ways to kill each other.

Under normal circumstances, spotted hyenas would choose to avoid adult lions.

But now, everyone had evolved and become stronger and stronger. The hyenas had many members and had become more united and brave. Therefore, if there were not many lions, they were not afraid.

At this moment, both sides were silently measuring each other's strength.

Other than possessing great strength, the mixed fur lion king was followed by three lions and three female lions. All of them were battle-hardened and combat experts.

As for the remaining three baboons and the two warthogs, he did not expect them to be of any use.

In front of the hyenas, they could be said to be fragile and did not even have the courage to fight.

To be honest, the three at the back had displayed very good strength previously. However, that was when they were facing marine creatures and they relied on sneak attacks.

The spotted hyenas were different from those sea creatures.

These fellows were extremely ferocious and their bite strength was even more terrifying than that of a lion. Now that they had mutated, be it their size or aura, they were much stronger than the three little fellows.

Once a battle happened, the hyenas would move in groups and not give them any chance to attack.

Furthermore, the hyenas were the nemesis of leopards and young cubs. Even an adult lioness could only flee when she saw them.

Therefore, the mixed fur lion king excluded the three of them.

Then, in the current situation, they only had four lions and three female lions that could crush any hyena.

It was a little unbearable.

However, to catch thieves, one had to catch the king first.

As long as he killed the hyena queen first, the hyenas would naturally be utterly defeated and be at their mercy\!

At the thought of this, the mixed fur lion king no longer hesitated. It bared its fangs and walked over with its pride.

He would not give up the merits he had obtained\!

There were probably many sea pythons hiding in this cave\!

The hyenas were furious at their bullying. Under the lead of the hyena queen, they walked over with a murderous aura.

Both sides were ready to fight and were getting closer and closer.

The two warthogs following behind the mixed fur lion king hurriedly ran into the distance and hid in the grass.

The three baboons immediately climbed up the tree beside them.

They were here to help kill the enemy and complete the mission, not to die.

Blue and Catherine walked to Chu Xiaoye's side and waited for his orders.

They naturally hated hyenas too.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not give any orders.

He looked at the two sides that were about to engage in a chaotic battle and was a little puzzled. Since they were here to kill the enemies of the sea, why did no one stop them from fighting among themselves?

Wasn't that pen bird hiding in the mane of the mixed fur lion king?

There should be such pen birds on the hyenas' side, right?

However, why did they not move at all at this time?

"Roarâ€”"

The battle was about to start\!

The mixed fur lion king roared angrily and pounced at the hyena queen.

His huge body and ferocious strength naturally made the hyena queen not dare to take him head-on. She immediately dodged to the side and called for her companions to surge forward.

The mixed fur lion king roared as it rushed into the hyena pack and bit the neck of a male hyena\!

The other hyenas immediately cried out and attacked.

At this moment, the other three lions and the three female lions also roared as they rushed over and protected the scar-faced lion king. Their butts faced each other, and their heads were facing out as they bared their teeth and bit.

Both sides knew each other's weaknesses.

The hyena queen ran and cried out with her companions, creating chaos. When she had the chance, she rushed up and bit them.

After a while, both sides suffered casualties.

The corpses of the two spotted hyenas lay on the ground.

The lower lip of a female lion was torn open and dripping with blood.

The mixed fur lion king wanted to kill the hyena queen first, but the other party clearly knew his intentions. He stayed in the middle of the hyenas and did not take the initiative to go forward.

This chaotic battle clearly could not end in a short time.

Chu Xiaoye was not in the mood to participate.

He walked towards the two strong warthogs hiding in the distance and growled at them to follow him.

He decided to take the time to kill the sea python in the cave.

However, the two warthogs relied on their height and sharp fangs and ignored him, a young lion.

They glanced at Chu Xiaoye and continued to lower their heads to dig at the roots of the plants.

"Crack\!"

Chu Xiaoye grabbed the tree trunk at the side and pulled gently. A large piece of bark and wood was suddenly dug out of the water bucket-like thick tree trunk\!

"Crack\!"

He swung his claw and another big piece of wood was dug out\!

Then, he used his third claw and a big hole immediately appeared on the tree trunk\!

"Bang\!"

He suddenly swung his claws and slapped heavily on the tree trunk that had a big hole dug out\!

The entire tree suddenly broke from the big hole with a crack and fell down\!

"Boom\!"

The thick tree trunk and dense canopy fell heavily to the ground, landing beside the two warthogs.

The two warthogs immediately let out a puff of urine. Then, their limbs turned limp and they fell to the ground, trembling.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them coldly, then turned around and gestured for them to follow.

The two warthogs no longer dared to be arrogant. They hurriedly got up and followed behind him while trembling. As they walked, they peed.

The male leopard looked stiffly at the fallen tree and quickly walked over. He stared at the torn tree trunk on the ground and raised his head to look at the young figure, his eyes filled with disbelief.

What kind of claws were actually so powerful?
