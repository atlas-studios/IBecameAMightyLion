Chapter 563: A Passionate Talent

In fact, the Qin father and son underestimated the influence of this great talent, Tang Yin.

When Tang Yin brought them onto the small boat and rowed towards the luxuriously decorated double-story ship, they were recognized by a few young male scholars on the boat just as they reached the middle of the river.

"Brother Tang\! It's Brother Tang\!"

"Look\! The leader of Suhang's four great talents, Tang Bolang, is here\!"

"Aiyaya\! It's really that great talent\! This scholarly meet will be lively\!"

"Quick\! Go upstairs and make room for a seat by the window\! No, two\! I want two\! Bring out the two vases of the Chinese Wine I prepared\!"

"Everyone, come down with me to welcome Brother Tang\!"

The big ship immediately became lively. Under the lead of a few talents, a group of scholars stood up and walked out of the cabin majestically, preparing to welcome this famous Great Scholar Tang.

As for the people behind him, no one looked at them seriously. However, as long as this great talent Tang brought them up, they definitely had a place on this ship. They had enough to eat, drink, and play\!

Chu Xiaoye followed behind the great scholar Tang and felt the charm of an idol for the first time.

Qin Zhitan, Qin Yu, and the others were terrified, uneasy, and excited. They were escorted into the cabin by the scholars and sent to a private room on the second floor.

After sitting on the second floor, the originally noisy scholars had to leave because there were only a handful of people who could stand here and talk to Great Scholar Tang.

However, no one was willing to leave after finally seeing this great talent Tang.

One of the older scholars had no choice but to bite the bullet under the urging of the other scholars around him. He suddenly said, "I've always heard that Brother Tang is talented and can write poems at your fingertips. You're even better at couplets and paintings. The scholarly meet today has gathered all the distinguished people in Suhang. Everyone admires Brother Tang's talent. It was not easy for me to see Brother Tang today. I hope that Brother Tang will not be stingy and leave a piece of work for my scholarly meet this time. It will be a beautiful story if it's spread. I wonder what Brother Tang thinks?"

"Yes, Brother Tang, please teach me."

"Brother Tang, let's write a poem. Coincidentally, the Courtesan Belle of the Red Moon Tower, Miss Luo Yi, is playing the guzheng here tonight to liven things up. Why don't Brother Tang write a poem for her and let her make a name for Brother Tang again at the banks of the Qinhuai River? Isn't that beautiful?"

"Right, right, right, right\! Brother Yang is right\! Brother Tang, look at Miss Luoyi. She's looking at you lovingly and expectantly."

The group of scholars immediately laughed and cheered.

As for the brothel courtesan named Luo Yi, she hurriedly stopped playing the guzheng and got up to walk over. She bowed gracefully and said softly, "If I can obtain Young Master Tang's reward, Luo Yi will thank you profusely, but I can't express my joy."

If she could obtain a poem bestowed by this great talent Tang, her status and reputation would definitely rise another level after tonight.

"Brother Tang, let's see how you can refuse now. Miss Luo Yi is about to kneel down. Haha."

The organizer of this gathering was also only famous outside. Furthermore, Young Master Mei, whose father was an official, personally persuaded him.

Tang Bolang found it difficult to refuse her kindness. He had brought so many people here to eat and drink today. It was inexcusable if he did not bring one of his works. He could only look at the woman who was still bowing in front of him and say, "Miss Luo Yi, give me a tune. However, you know that poems sometimes come uninvited and sometimes are as painful as constipation. If I can't do it, you can't be angry."

If anyone else said this, they would definitely attract many disdainful gazes and curses, "Rough\!"

However, when the great talent Tang said it, they felt that he was really cute and approachable. They all laughed out loud.

Young Master Mei smiled and said, "Brother Tang, just do it without worry. If you're really constipated, wait a few days. Hahaha."

His words made everyone laugh again.

The woman named Luo Yi blushed and thought for a moment before saying, "Then Young Master Tang, make a poem with "Butterfly Love Flower". Coincidentally, I'm also singing this poem tonight."

"Butterfly Love Flower? That's not easy to do. There are so many gems created by your predecessors. Brother Tang, you're in a difficult position."

When Young Master Mei heard this, he deliberately provoked him, hoping that this great talent Tang would be able to come up with a poem that would not surpass those his predecessors but at least, shine in Suhang by the Qinhuai River.

"Butterfly Love Flower?"

Tang Bolang frowned and thought carefully. "Let me think."

The cabin immediately quietened down. No one dared to make a sound, afraid that they would disturb this great talent Tang.

Just as Tang Bolang was thinking, he suddenly saw the youth sitting opposite him. His heart suddenly skipped a beat and he asked tentatively, "Does Brother Chu know how to write poems?"

Actually, there was no need to ask. How could someone who could complete couplets so well not know how to write poems?

However, it was difficult to write poems on the spot.

"Brother Tang, this talent is?"

Young Master Mei looked at the youth who was sitting opposite the great scholar.

He originally thought that this youth was young and should be a relative of the great scholar Tang. Now, it seemed that he was only a friend.

Someone who could make friends with the great scholar Tang was not simple.

"Make poems?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. Seeing that the gazes of these people had turned from the great scholar Tang to him, he immediately felt like he was sitting on a carpet of needles. He hurriedly said, "Of course not. I don't know how to make poems."

"You don't?"

Seeing that he rejected him so decisively, Tang Bo Lang became even more distrustful.

He rolled his eyes and got up. He walked over and sat beside Chu Xiaoye, hugging his shoulder affectionately. "Brother Chu, since we're friends, we'll enjoy fortune and suffer together. You saw it too. I'm being forced to write poems by these people. I can't do it in a short time. It's embarrassing. Why don't you write a poem and help me out? It's also helping me once. How about that?"

He had actually already thought of a poem in his heart, but he did not feel that it was too good. He still needed to refine it more and was afraid that if he hurriedly took it out, it would damage his reputation as a great talent. Also, he wanted to test how talented this youth was.

Being able to match such an imposing couplet, his talent was plain to see. However, he did not know how powerful his talent was.

Therefore, he planned to use this opportunity to test it.

"So it's Young Master Chu. Nice to meet you\!"

That Young Master Mei was surprised to see the great talent Tang praising this youth so much, but he did not show it on his face. He immediately said warmly, "Since Young Master Tang said so, then Young Master Chu, you can't refuse anymore. Look, so many young masters are looking at you eagerly. Miss Luo Yi is waiting until the flowers are about to wilt. It would be bad if Young Master Chu continues to refuse."

Actually, he had never thought that this youth could say anything. However, since the great scholar Tang was trying his best to encourage him, there must be another reason. He naturally had to follow suit.

He was actually guessing that perhaps the great talent Tang was deliberately embarrassing this young man in front of so many people?

As for the reason, Young Master Mei looked at the few girls wearing headscarves sitting beside the young man. Although they were all wearing headscarves, their figures and faces were the best of the best. These could not be hidden.

Even he could not control himself when he saw it just now, let alone the elegant and talented Tang?

Therefore, what he wanted to do was to help Great Scholar Tang add fuel to the fire so that he could fawn on this great talent who might become a government official during this year's examination.
