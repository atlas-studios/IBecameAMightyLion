Chapter 192: The Fastest Evolutionary\!

Obviously.

After the red rain, all the animals became stronger.

As for Chu Xiaoye, his strength was even more terrifying than before.

From the way he slapped the wandering lion away, it could be seen that even if the blue-eyed lion king was not injured on the snow mountain, it was probably not his match.

All animals were evolving.

However, he realized that his and Catherine's evolution was faster.

Perhaps this was related to the strange heat in his body.

After all, his body had always been modified by the heat. A long time ago, golden claws and extraordinary strength had evolved.

As for Catherine, it was probably because of his saliva and blood.

Their evolution had long started and was a step ahead of all the animals and plants on the grassland. Naturally, they were a little faster.

Furthermore, because their bodies had already been modified, they would be more adapted to this storm. Their evolution speed would always be at the front.

This was a dangerous era and also an era filled with opportunities.

Chu Xiaoye did not feel any fear or uneasiness regarding these absurd and bizarre changes. Instead, he felt a little excited and expectant.

His era might have arrived\!

The wandering lion completely stopped breathing amid cries of despair and unwillingness.

Before he died, he looked at the territory here and the young lion in the territory.

Originally, he had already defeated the blue-eyed lion king, and a large territory and lionesses, as well as the supreme throne, were already within his reach.

He could officially start to enjoy the beautiful life of a lion king.

However, because of his roar, everything failed on the verge of success and he even lost his life.

Before he died, other than despair and unwillingness, there was probably also deep regret and confusion in his heart.

Perhaps he never would have thought that he would die at the hands of a young lion who had yet to grow a mane. Furthermore, he did not have the strength to retaliate.

When he completely swallowed his last breath, the blue-eyed lion king also stood up after a short rest.

His entire body was riddled with wounds and dripping with blood.

Especially the wound on his butt, even his bones were exposed.

However, his endurance was extremely strong.

He stared at the corpse of the wandering lion on the ground in a daze for a while, then turned around and looked at the young figure at the borders of the territory.

That strand of golden fur fluttered like flames under the sun, beautiful and dazzling.

The aura of this young lion seemed to have changed drastically.

Half a month ago, their strength seemed to be almost the same.

He was even stronger.

Now, even though he was standing there without moving, he felt extremely depressed and desperate.

As for the two slaps that sent the wandering lion flying, he did not see them clearly.

He knew that this young lion was already terrifyingly strong. No matter what, he had no chance of winning against him.

Today, he had already resolved to die. Unexpectedly, under the other party's unintentional interference, he turned the tables and saved his life and the throne.

However, he knew that the current him was no longer worthy of possessing this vast and fertile territory, nor was he worthy of possessing these female lions and subordinates, let alone being king next to him.

Here, only the strongest were qualified to be king.

Obviously, he no longer had the qualifications.

He turned around and looked at the lionesses and his subordinates behind him, then at the vast and fertile grassland.

Then, he limped towards the young lion king.

Only he was qualified to have this territory and this pride\!

However, before he could reach the borders of the territory, the young lion king had already turned around and left.

The blue-eyed lion king was stunned for a moment before hurriedly roaring, signaling him to wait.

However, the other party ignored him.

As for the powerful lioness cub, she even looked at him coldly, warning him not to cross the border marked with urine.

The blue-eyed lion king froze in place, a little stunned and at a loss.

On this grassland, every powerful lion wanted to have more territory, more female lions, and more subordinates. Only then could they be worthy of the might of the king of the grassland.

However, why did this young king look like he did not care at all?

Could it be that he really did not have any thoughts about his vast territory and the beautiful female lions?

"Dream on\!"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye muttered to himself as he walked into the bushes.

He had clearly saved the life of the blue-eyed lion king and even helped him protect the throne. Not only did the other party not give him any food to thank him, he even wanted to trick him into becoming his successor and accept that group of ungrateful and fickle old women\!

Damn it\!

Looking at the ambiguous attitude that the female lions and lions had towards the wandering lion just now and their coldness towards their king, he felt disgusted.

Although the rules of the pride had always been like this, he could not accept it.

The pride he needed was absolute loyalty and unity.

Furthermore, times had changed. Many things were quietly changing and many rules had to be changed.

Just like the previous alliance of carnivores and herbivores, the white lion and the crocodiles dealt with the python in the sea together. Only by being united could they survive.

He would not accept a group of things that would even leave their king in the lurch\!

Back then, if not for the protection of the blue-eyed lion king, the female lions and foreign lions would have been bullied by the hyenas and lions around them and wandered around in panic.

Now, when they saw their king limping and disfigured, they had a change of heart?

They were more fickle than humans\!

He would rather be a lone lion than raise a group of white-eyed lions that would betray him at any time\!

Furthermore, the current territory and the members of the territory were enough for him, who had yet to become an adult.

At that time, it would not be too late to expand his territory after fetching Little Curly Tail and the others.

Catherine followed behind and looked at his unmoved back. Her dark eyes were filled with bright light.

The temptation of territory and female lions was not something every lion could resist. Wasn't the life of a lion for territory and female lions?

Yet now, he refused without hesitation. It could be seen that his ambition was not here.

His ambition and dreams were definitely not limited to this place. This small territory, or even the entire grassland, might not be able to carry his great dream.

In her heart, even the king of the grassland was not worthy of him.

He was the man who was going to become the king of all beasts\!

As for her, Catherine, she would become his claws and weapons. She would fight for his dream and kill for his path to becoming a king\!

The forest became lively again.

The lush vegetation and lush greenery attracted more birds and animals.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the mud pit and dragged the huge water buffalo leader out with Catherine. Then, he started to eat fresh steak.

His mouth was becoming pickier and pickier. He did not even look at the internal organs that he had eaten with relish when he was young.

This giant water buffalo leader had clearly undergone a huge mutation. The meat was even more fresh and elastic. When chewed in his mouth, there was even a sweet smell.

The juice in his mouth had an additional taste that was different from before. He felt like he was eating a true feast.

Originally, hunting and eating were just to fill his stomachs, but now, he seemed to be enjoying himself.

It was as if he had returned to his former human life.

He did not know how this blood-like rain would change humans.

Could it be that they would start to mutate like the animals and plants in this grassland?

If that was the case, it would be even more lively.

Furthermore, perhaps those boring humans who were changing certain animals would suddenly be unable to take care of themselves and would no longer have the time and energy to continue doing such boring and terrifying things.

It might be a good thing for the animals on the grassland.

When Chu Xiaoye was eating the beef, Catherine stood respectfully at the side. Even if he took the initiative to invite her over to eat, the female cub would never come over. She would only come over to enjoy it when he finished eating.

From the beginning until now, she had always treated herself as his servant and had always felt inferior and did not dare to eat with him.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and stared at her carefully. He realized that the emotions in the little lioness's dark eyes were becoming more and more abundant.

If one did not look at his appearance and only looked at his eyes, it was as if he was looking at a pair of human eyes.

It seemed that this evolution was not just physical evolution.

Chu Xiaoye felt that the animals on this grassland were probably more intelligent than before.

This was probably a bad thing for humans.

For animals, the competition in the future would be even more intense and cruel.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his head and looked at the distant grassland.

At the end of the grassland was the sea, and the blood rain would probably cause the creatures in the sea to undergo a tremendous change.

In this case, the situation was even more complicated.

"Roarâ"

Just as he was thinking about something, the roars of the two female lions suddenly came from the grassland near the river.

His roar was trembling and was clearly filled with fear.

Then, the Chino brothers' terrified roars suddenly sounded.

Clearly, an enemy had invaded.

Chu Xiaoye immediately got up and ran away with Catherine.

After becoming a lion king and possessing a territory, it was inevitable that he would encounter all sorts of challenges and duels. He was already mentally prepared.

However, he did not know if the invaders were other animals or wandering lions.

As a new king, he would never show mercy to invaders. He had to spread his fierce and powerful reputation so that other enemies would be afraid of him.

When he ran out of the bushes with Catherine, he saw a huge lion from afar\!

It was a white lion\!

The two female lions bared their fangs and roared at the huge white lion. Their bodies were trembling, and they were clearly terrified.

As for the Chino brothers, they were already lying on the ground, shivering and peeing.

This was their instinctive fear of the strong.

Not to mention them, even Chu Xiaoye himself felt a chill when he saw the tall and strong white lion that was like a water buffalo.

This was not a suppression of size.

The aura of an expert could not be disguised.

However, no matter how strong the other party was, if they wanted to invade his territory, they would have to pay a price that they would regret forever\!

His claws were not made of dough\!
