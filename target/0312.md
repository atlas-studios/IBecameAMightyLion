Chapter 312: Come Back Quickly

"Bang\!"

He punched the tree again.

The other lions under the tree immediately retreated, afraid that they would be smashed to death for no reason like the few unlucky fellows previously.

When the tree was about to collapse, Chu Xiaoye and the other two jumped onto another tree.

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and continued to provoke the tree.

Haas was furious. He roared angrily and ordered the pride to split up and surround the forest.

He no longer used his fists to smash the tree. Instead, he waited below and decided to trap them alive.

He decided to play the waiting game.

If the tree moved, he would move too. If the tree did not move, he would not move either.

Let's see who could last until the end\!

"Roar—"

Haas roared angrily and let all the lions stay while the female lions went down the mountain to hunt.

Until now, he still did not seem to know that there was no prey left to hunt on the grassland at the foot of the mountain.

Chu Xiaoye could imagine that after the more than 200 female lions left majestically, there might be no return.

Hunger and concern for cubs would quickly break the loyalty of the female lions.

Then, they dispersed and fled.

Looking at the golden-haired lion king pretending to be calm as it lay down to rest and wait with the lions who were hungry, Chu Xiaoye really wanted to tell him that he was about to be cuckolded.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail suddenly climbed up to the canopy and swung his tail. He actually slapped down a big bird that was about to fly over the top of the tree. Then, he curled his tail and climbed down.

Hence, Chu Xiaoye and the other three started to pluck fur and eat meat, deliberately making a lot of noise.

The lions under the tree immediately drooled and became even hungrier.

"Roar—"

Haas roared angrily and told everyone not to look. He also started to draw cakes for them to allay their hunger. The female lions would soon return with a large amount of food. At that time, everyone could eat enough\!

Hence, the lions immediately lowered their heads in anticipation.

However, when the feathers on the tree fluttered down, many hungry lions could not help but start to lick them secretly. They even chewed the feathers and swallowed them.

When Chu Xiaoye and the other two finished eating the big bird, they immediately started to jump on the tree with a whoosh.

Haas immediately stood up and ran under the tree with the pride, not giving the other party any chance to escape\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly discovered a bird's nest on a big tree. When he got close, he saw many eggs inside.

Hence, the four of them started to eat with relish.

The lions under the tree drooled on the ground. Their eyes were red as they raised their heads, waiting for some leftovers to fall.

In the end, Little Curly Tail peed down with a whoosh.

The few lions did not react and thought that it was broken egg liquid. They immediately opened their mouths and jumped up to snatch it. They did not even taste it and swallowed it into their stomachs.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail immediately laughed hysterically on the tree.

Haas was furious. With a bang, he started to hit the tree trunk with his fists again. However, he only hit it once and stopped.

After the rain stopped, the sky was blue.

Many birds ran out of the forest, jumping and chirping.

"Roar—"

Haas immediately roared angrily and scared the birds away, lest the stupid birds fly over to feed the four fellows on the tree.

When the birds in the forest fled in panic, he raised his head and looked at the tree with a mocking expression, as if he was saying, "If we're hungry, you have to be hungry too\! However, we will soon have female lions delivering delicious food. As for you, starve to death on the tree\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and rubbed the golden mane on his neck. He turned around and looked at Little Curly Tail and Catherine.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail and Catherine immediately jumped towards different trees and quickly jumped away.

Haas suddenly stood up, hesitated for a moment, and squatted down again. He did not let the lions split up to chase after him, but continued to guard him.

Not long after.

Little Curly Tail and Catherine jumped back.

Haas grinned. Just as he was about to be pleased with himself, he saw that they were actually holding prey in their mouths\!

Catherine was actually biting a monkey\!

As for Little Curly Tail, he was biting a pheasant and had three pheasants wrapped around his tail\!

Hence, the four of them started to eat heartily on the tree again.

This time, the hungry lions under the tree were famished.

"Roar—"

Some lions started to lose control. They stood up and paced around in frustration.

Some lions raised their upper bodies and climbed on the tree. They looked up pitifully and drooled.

Some lions looked down the mountain uneasily, looking like they were preparing to leave.

Haas was furious. He immediately roared angrily, bared his fangs, and revealed a fierce expression.

This suppressed the restless thoughts of these lions.

However, if they continued to starve, something would definitely happen.

Before setting off, they had already eaten their fill. Normally, they could last for three to four days, but after two days and two nights of running and roaring, the food in their stomachs had long been digested.

Originally, they could still last for a day, but Chu Xiaoye's team kept eating on the tree and deliberately made a lot of noise. How could they tolerate this?

Hence, they became increasingly hungry and wanted to leave the team to hunt.

The feathers on the tree fluttered down and a few bones deliberately fell.

The lions under the tree no longer cared about their brotherhood and roared as they fought over it. A few even bared their fangs and fought for a few bloody bird fur.

Little Curly Tail watched with relish from the tree. He deliberately smacked his mouth and ate loudly.

"Roar—"

Seeing that the lions were about to start rioting, Haas made a prompt decision and immediately roared angrily. He suddenly jumped up and punched one by one. With two bangs, he hit the brains of the two lions that were biting each other until they cracked and died\!

Then, he widened his eyes and looked coldly and fiercely at his subordinates. He bared his fangs and looked murderous.

The lion king's might and dominance were extremely exquisite at this moment\!

Finally, the lions lowered their heads and returned to their prey, squatting down.

In order to survive, they could only wait patiently for the lionesses to return from hunting.

Haas raised his head and looked up with hatred. Then, he turned around and looked at the grassland at the foot of the mountain.

If more than 200 female lions went out, no matter how stupid they were, they could definitely catch prey\!

Perhaps at this moment, they were hunting a large group of gazelles, zebras, and even a large group of water buffaloes.

He believed that before long, his female lions would return majestically with a large amount of meat\!

However, the truth was…

On the grassland at the foot of the mountain.

The two hundred female lions split into a few teams and searched for prey everywhere, but they found nothing. Gradually, they left the forest and continued forward.

Soon, they saw their territory in the distance and suddenly thought of their children.

Even the female lions without children suddenly remembered that there were large groups of herbivores in their territory.

Hence, they drooled and wanted to return.

On the distant forest.

Haas and the lions were still hungry and waiting anxiously.

"Come back quickly—"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye, who was on the tree, really wanted to pick up the microphone and roar.
