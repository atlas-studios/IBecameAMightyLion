Chapter 308: The Dead Father

"Bang\!"

An explosion\!

Haas' fist suddenly smashed over\!

The lion wrapped around Little Curly Tail's tail had its head explode and it was sent flying.

Just as Little Curly Tail was about to roll up the other lion corpse on the ground, Ha Si had already pounced forward and suddenly smashed his head.

It was too fast for Little Curly Tail to dodge.

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out from the side. With a roar, it suddenly collided with the strong body of the golden-haired lion king from the side\!

"Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail was still hit in the head, but the punch was already greatly weakened.

Even so, he was still hit in the head by this punch. His vision turned black and he fell to the ground. For a moment, he could not get up.

He looked up and saw that the figure that had collided with the golden-haired lion king was his father.

The cold father and Haas fell to the ground together.

However, before the cold father could stand up, Haas' huge and terrifying fist had already smashed into his head with a whoosh.

Ferocious and fierce\!

"Bang\!"

An explosion\!

It sounded like something was breaking.

The cold father's head was hit and he flew out. After flying for more than ten meters, he fell heavily to the ground and instantly stopped moving.

At this moment, the surroundings suddenly fell into a short silence.

The members of the pride of the cold father looked blankly at the figure that landed on the distant grass. Their breathing stopped and their hearts almost stopped.

"Roarâ€”"

A roar shook the night sky\!

Little Curly Tail's eyes were red as he suddenly jumped up and pounced at the golden-haired lion king as if he had gone crazy.

Lars and the four female lions also pounced crazily.

Facing the overflowing hatred and anger of the members of the cold father's pride, Haas grinned and retreated, preparing to lure this pride deeper into the territory and catch them in one fell swoop.

At this moment, an angry roar suddenly came from the opposite territory.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the other six tall lions were the first to rush over. They crossed the territory and pounced over.

One-eyed also rushed over with a dense pride.

When Haas saw this scene, he knew that the time was past. He immediately growled and let the pride surrounding him return and retreat behind him.

His gains tonight had already exceeded his expectations.

The lion whose head he had smashed with a punch was not something that lioness spy could compare to. If he was not wrong, that lion should be the father of this long-tailed young lion and the young lion king\!

It was too worth it to exchange a female lion for the life of the lion king's father.

Therefore, he should stop when he was ahead.

Haas opened his mouth and searched the pride that had rushed over. He wanted to see the expression of the young lion king when he saw his father's corpse.

It would definitely be interesting.

Little Curly Tail was covered in blood. His eyes were red as he prepared to pounce on it again, but he was stopped by the tall Blue Eyes.

They had to wait for the king to arrive.

Tonight, Chu Xiaoye brought Mei Mei, Catherine, and the others to the territory near the last forest to check the resources of the prey and record the distribution and numbers of the various herbivores in the territory. Therefore, they arrived rather slowly.

Before the king returned, if they fought the other party without permission, no one could bear the consequences.

A tragedy had already happened. Blue Eyes hoped that when the young king returned, he would see his father's corpse, and not the corpses of his brother and other relatives.

If that was the case, it would be too cruel.

Little Curly Tail's roar was trembling and his whimpers sounded like crying.

His father died for him.

How should he explain to his brother?

Aisha, Xi'er, Callie, and Maya whimpered and roared, not daring to look back at the badly mutilated figure that terrified and grieved them.

The team behind him suddenly dispersed and made way.

The noisy roars gradually quietened down at this moment.

Little Curly Tail trembled and lowered his head, feeling sad and guilty.

He knew that his brother was here.

Haas looked up at the path that opened up opposite and his pupils suddenly constricted.

All eyes looked over.

A strong young lion walked over from the back of the team with a group of young female lions.

His lush golden mane flickered with a charming luster under the moonlight. Under the night wind, it fluttered in the wind like a golden flag.

His deep eyes were like the stars in the night sky, bright and dazzling, emitting a gem-like charm.

The team beside him, every pride, and every member revealed respectful and respectful gazes.

This was their king, a strong and charming king\!

Even the members of the pride opposite could not help but praise in their hearts when they saw this figure.

They had never seen such a charming king\!

When those vaguely flickering golden eyes looked at them, their hearts could not help but race and they felt suffocated.

Even the few loyal guards standing behind Haas suddenly felt flustered and uneasy when they looked at these strange eyes.

Haas froze in place, the muscles at the corner of his eyes twitching slightly. His eyes were filled with the golden mane. At this moment, he suddenly felt that the golden fur on his entire body was as disgusting as a worm in the mud.

His eyes turned red and he gritted his teeth.

Fortunately, this young king was about to suffer the pain and sadness of losing his father in front of so many eyes. He might even show all sorts of comical and pitiful states.

At the thought that the other party was going to embarrass himself, he could not help but grin.

Of course, he still had to act on the surface.

"Roarâ€”"

He growled and looked at the young lion king, questioning why he wanted to invade his territory again.

Since the other party invaded first, it was naturally not wrong for him to kill a lion.

However, the other party ignored him.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of Little Curly Tail and saw him lowering his head with a terrified and guilty expression. He then looked at the sadness on his mother and the others' faces. His body suddenly trembled, as if he had realized something.

He raised his head and searched for the cold father, but he did not find him.

Little Curly Tail let out a whimper.

Aisha, Callie, and the others lowered their heads, not daring to look at the corpse behind them.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Xi'er.

Xi'er knew that this was not the time to be sad. She had to take revenge\!

She raised her head and looked sadly at the young king. Then, she turned around and walked towards the cold father's corpse.

Chu Xiaoye followed behind her, his body trembling.

However, when Xi'er stopped in the grass, the ground was already empty. There was no sign of the cold father, only a pool of blood.

Xi'er stood there in a daze for a few seconds. She immediately raised her head and searched the surroundings.

However, the grass around them was empty. Other than the corpses of the lions that Little Curly Tail had killed, there was no sign of the cold father.

Xi'er looked stunned.

His head had clearly been smashed by a punch and he died on the spot. He was lying on the ground motionless. Why did he suddenly disappear?

"Roarâ€”"

At this moment, roars suddenly came from behind the team.

When the elderly lions heard the news, they rushed over with a murderous aura.

What shocked Xi'er was that the strong figure that ran majestically at the front and led the elderly lions here was actually the cold father who had already died tragically\!
