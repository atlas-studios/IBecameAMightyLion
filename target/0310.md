Chapter 310: The King's Conspiracy

Two days later.

In a territory guarded by the Chino brothers, two female lions suddenly died.

After just one night, bad news came from the other territories.

The five female lions that went out to hunt and the few young cubs that stayed in the camp died tragically.

Before One-eyed could find the murderer, a tragedy also happened to the elderly lions near the river.

The two old lions that had gone out to patrol at night were beheaded and died silently at the border of their territory.

The cold father was furious.

Chu Xiaoye could only bring Catherine around to patrol.

Little Curly Tail, Molly, Tilly, and Mei Mei would patrol the surrounding bushes every night to prevent those villains from sneaking into their camp.

Chu Xiaoye knew that the golden-haired lion king finally could not hold back. Or rather, it could not tolerate it and started to take action in advance.

Those spies had originally wanted to join the various prides and slowly become important members of the prides. Then, when the two sides were fighting, they would suddenly attack, create chaos, break the formation, or attack from the front and back to affect the battle. However, they were targeted and dug out one by one.

If they continued to wait, they would probably be completely annihilated before they could attack.

Therefore, they could only take action in advance to assassinate some members and weaken the number of this team. At the same time, they could create fear and chaos for the entire team.

This way, the golden-haired lion king might be able to grab the opportunity to determine the victor in a battle.

However, when these tragic cases happened one after another, Chu Xiaoye had already become vigilant in advance. He immediately let the Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the other members guard the territory of the pride of the cold father.

At the same time, he ordered One-eyed and Lars to start summoning every member who could fight and quickly assemble in the territory of the pride of the cold father at the front.

He knew that the golden-haired lion king had already given up on fighting alone and was preparing to rely on the pride to fight.

He had to assemble the team in advance and prepare.

When the entire team started to gather towards the pride of the cold father, he brought Catherine to patrol in the dark. The cold father also brought the old lions to patrol everywhere.

Finally, in two nights, they killed a total of ten spies.

There were female lions and male lions.

There were even female lions with cubs.

Chu Xiaoye did not relent and killed them all.

Ever since his evolution that night, his eyes saw further and clearer at night. Standing on a high ground, he could almost clearly look down at the territory of the cold father's pride. He could even see the appearance of every member five to six kilometers away\!

This made him quickly discover the members who had abnormal behavior.

Among them were two lion spies who were extremely strong. Even when surrounded by the cold father and the elderly lions, they seriously injured a few elderly lions and broke out of the encirclement.

However, Catherine cut open their stomachs in the end.

While they were gathering the team to clean up the spies, Haas, who was next door, was also quietly preparing.

All the prides were gathered on the grassland only a kilometer away from the border of the two sides, ready to move at any time.

After cleaning up nearly twenty spies, Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine back to the territory of the pride of the cold father and guarded the front, waiting solemnly.

Even at this moment, he still did not want the teams on both sides to fight.

If the black lion army suddenly attacked while they were in the middle of the battle, wouldn't they lose everything?

Therefore, he had to think of a way to prevent the battle from expanding.

It would naturally be best if he could solve the problem without bleeding.

It was already night.

Dark clouds were dense in the sky, and there was no moon or stars.

The rain during the rainy season always came very often and quickly.

When Chu Xiaoye climbed up the canopy of the tallest tree in the bushes and saw the densely packed team gathered behind the bushes, his heart suddenly skipped a beat.

With more than four hundred members gathered, if they did not fight soon, they would soon collapse because of food.

For animals, food was always first.

If there was no food, not to mention him, as a king, even his family would betray him.

In other words, if the Golden Fur Lion King's team did not get any food to fill their stomachs during these few days, they would definitely collapse immediately.

Even a well-trained human army would never win a battle if they could not eat their fill.

Therefore, he could start with the food and make the opposite pride lose without a fight. This way, he could avoid many casualties.

At the thought of this, he stopped hesitating and immediately climbed down the tree. He called Lars, One-eyed, and Blue Eyes over and assigned them their respective missions.

Other than the members of the cold father's pride, the four hundred plus members were immediately divided into ten teams. Then, led by Lars and the others, they started to chase away all the herbivores in the territory.

Because Chu Xiaoye had already recorded the distribution of the various herbivores a few days ago, their goal was very accurate. They did not need to waste too much energy searching and ran over.

The mission Chu Xiaoye handed them was not only to get rid of all the herbivores in this territory, but also to hide at the edge of the grassland to prevent any herbivores from returning. At the same time, he also gave the blue-eyed and mixed fur a more important mission.

Of course, when chasing away those herbivores, they had to fill their stomachs as quickly as possible.

Although everyone was puzzled and uneasy about his decision, under the lead of the various team leaders, no one dared to disobey.

After the team left under orders, Chu Xiaoye brought the members of the pride of the cold father and the twenty-plus strong lions he had specially chosen to come aggressively to the border in front of him. They roared in unison and deliberately provoked him.

Haas' team could not hold back anymore. When they heard the provocative roar, they immediately roared in response.

Haas originally wanted to gather the team and launch a sudden attack. Seeing that his plan seemed to have been exposed, he could only bring the team hiding a kilometer away and charge over majestically.

Chu Xiaoye let the twenty-over lions behind him fight separately. There were also a few lions hiding in the bushes, roaring continuously. It seemed like a team was gathering.

Seeing that his team had yet to gather, Haas thought that it was a good opportunity. He immediately roared angrily and crossed the border with more than 300 members with a murderous aura\!

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily, as if he was scolding him.

"Golden retriever\! Do you dare to fight alone?"

Haas grinned and sneered. He roared and pounced at him.

The pride behind him surged over like a flood\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and turned to run with the pride\!

The twenty-over lions behind them ran faster than them.

When Haas saw this scene, he was overjoyed. He decided to take this opportunity to wipe out this team\!

"Roarâ€”"

He roared angrily with high fighting spirit\!

Seeing that the other party was actually so fragile, the pride behind him immediately had high morale and courage. They roared in unison and fought to catch up to him.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and roared as he fled towards the forest in a hurry.

Haas ignored him and chased after him with all his might.

When all the prides surged into this territory like a tide and surged towards the forest, at the edge of the territory of the cold father's pride, blue eyes and mixed fur brought a group of strong lions and suddenly crossed the border of the territory and touched the nest of the pride.

There were more than ten female lions and a large group of young cubs.

The mission of the blue-eyed and mixed fur was naturally not to take the opportunity to kill them. They were used as bait.

When the Xiang Yu army was ambushed by Han Xin from all sides, The Chu nation's ballads would ring out every night, evoking the Chu army's longing for their home. Hence, the Chu army fled one after another, wanting to return home.

Now, Chu Xiaoye decided to use those young cubs to remind the female lions of their longing for their children.

How brave and pleased those female lions were when they chased after him now. At that time, they would be terrified and hesitant.

Food and children would make them make the right choice.

Chu Xiaoye brought the members of the pride of the cold father and the twenty-over lions to lure the Haas army behind him to run on the grassland.

Around them, Lars, One-eyed, and the other lions were leading the various prides to chase away the panicked herbivores.

Many herbivores started to run towards Haas's territory. Some tribes fled into the forest, and some jumped into the river and ran towards the opposite shore, ignoring the killers in the river.

It was as if the world was ending.

Although these prides listened obediently, they were very uneasy and suspicious.

Now that they had chased away these herbivores, what would they eat in the future? Would they starve to death without food?

When they saw the backs of the herbivores fleeing in panic and fleeing into the distance, many members started to doubt the young lion king's decision.

They indeed trusted the young king very much and were very grateful to him and respected him. However, that did not mean that they would continue to bow down to him while hungry.

Most of the cubs followed behind them.

What should they do without food?

That night, every member was terrified.

Even if they were asked to charge and fight to the death with the pride of Haas, they would not be so uneasy.

Furthermore, after chasing away the herbivores, they did not leave immediately. Instead, they stationed themselves at the edge. Once they saw herbivores approaching, they continued to chase them away.

At first, there might be food to eat, but gradually, the herbivores would not come again.

At that time, could they only wait for death here?

With this thought in mind, they waited until dawn.

When the sun rose, they could no longer see their territory and pride. They could only wait at the edge of the unfamiliar and desolate grassland for no reason.

Finally, some members could not hold back and wanted to leave the team and return to their former territory.

However, every time a member prepared to leave, he would be mercilessly killed by the captain of its team.

One-eyed killed two female lions. The Jerry brothers each killed a lion. Lars also killed a female lion. Even the cold father killed two old lions mercilessly.

Under this strong and bloody method, the various teams finally quietened down for the time being.

However, they were still terrified and restless.

Until two days later, they did not see any herbivores again.

They were hungry.

They were finally about to lose control.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye had already lured the pride of Haas into running, stopping, and almost running into the forest.

"Roarâ€”"

He suddenly jumped onto a big tree and let out a high and long roar.

Then, roars rose and fell in the distance.

Under the roars, One-eyed, Jerry, Lars, and the other lion captains immediately brought their teams away from the edge of the grassland and walked towards the territory of the pride.

The teams that were about to lose control finally calmed down.

When they passed the border of the cold father's pride and walked into the territory of the pride of Haas and saw Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur eating and drinking in the golden-haired lion king's camp, they suddenly realized something.

At this moment, in the bushes, a group of female lions and 70 to 80 young cubs popped their heads out in fear and looked at them with terrified expressions.

These were the captured female lions and young cubs of Haas' pride.

Seeing this scene, not only were the members of the various teams enlightened and shocked, even One-eyed, Jerry, Lars, and the other captains reacted.

It turned out that their king was not only scheming about the food of the Golden Fur Lion King's team, he was also scheming about the other party's cubs\!

This way, they swapped territory with the Golden Fur Lion King's team. There was plenty of food here, as well as the other party's lionesses and cubs. As for the other party, other than chasing for a few days, feeling tired, thirsty, and hungry, they did not obtain anything\!

When the other party realized that something was wrong, it was already too late\!

They were without food, exhausted, and lost their territory and cubs, how could they fight?

Obviously, their aggressive and seemingly unstoppable team would soon be dejected, terrified, and desperate. They would scatter and lose without a fight\!

"Roarâ€”"

At the thought of this, all the members who had come here immediately roared excitedly. They admired the young king even more.

Even the cold father could not help but roar. Then, he walked out proudly from the crowd and stood proudly. He looked around as if he was telling everyone again that he was the father of the young king\!

However, other than his old companions behind him looking at him in admiration, no one cared about him, the Grand Supreme King.

There was plenty of food here and they finally did not have to worry about being hungry.

Before Chu Xiaoye returned, every team was still led by the captain and could not leave the team without permission.

Therefore, One-eyed and the others immediately brought their teams to hunt to satiate their hunger.

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur instructed the members who had eaten their fill to guard the border and not let the herbivores migrate over.

At the same time.

Haas brought his pride and finally forced Chu Xiaoye's team to the foot of the mountain and the edge of the grassland.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not stop. He brought the team into the forest.

At this moment.

Haas realized that something was wrong.

After chasing for so long, he seemed to have only seen these few enemies. Where were the other enemies?

Could they have run into the forest in advance?

The pride behind him started to become restless.

Because after running for two days and two nights, they were already hungry.

Some female lions suddenly thought of the young cubs left in the camp. It seemed that they should be breastfeeding or feeding.
