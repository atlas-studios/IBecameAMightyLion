Chapter 31: Shameless Little Thief

"Hey\! You're courting death\!"

The hyena was frightened at first.

However, when it saw that the lion that pounced out was not an adult lion but a cub, it was happy.

Were all the little fellows nowadays so stupid and ignorant?

Even your mothers do not dare to start a war with us hyenas easily. Yet, a little thing like you are baring your fangs and brandishing your claws as you charge over. Have you gone stupid from drinking milk?

The hyena bared its fangs, its eyes filled with disdain and coldness.

He was prepared to teach this daring little cub one last lesson in life—Second Brother was not to be trifled with\!

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye pounced over ferociously.

The Second Brother of Africa's eyes flashed ferociously. It opened his mouth and bit down fiercely\!

It wanted to break the cub's neck with one bite\!

However, Chu Xiaoye did not want to bite it. Just as it got close, he suddenly raised his claw and slapped its mouth\!

His actions were extremely fast\!

Then…

The second brother flew out and lost a tooth. He fell to the ground, his mouth full of blood and his vision blurred.

Second Brother was stunned again…

Could a lion cub possess such strength and speed?

Even a mature lion could not possibly send it flying with one slap, right?

In the bushes not far away, the leopard and her daughter were shocked.

Before the hyena could get up from the ground, Chu Xiaoye rushed up with a whoosh and bit its spine\!

"Crack\!"

With a crisp sound, the hyena's spine broke\!

It suddenly let out a scream, turned its head, and bit at Chu Xiaoye crazily\!

However, it could not stand up.

Chu Xiaoye nimbly dodged it and bit its thigh again. With a crack, he bit off its thigh bone\!

The hyena's miserable and desperate cries spread throughout the entire forest in the silent night\!

The herbivores in the surrounding forest fled in panic.

Not far away, the leopard mother and daughter pair in the bush widened their amber eyes and hid there, not daring to move.

The sounds of the hyena would attract other hyenas or other carnivores.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay any longer. He turned around and left. He went over and picked up the giant forest pig, preparing to go to the bees' nest to inject preservatives into it to make dried pork.

He had just taken a few steps when a figure suddenly jumped out from the bushes beside him and pounced on him\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly threw down the prey in his mouth and turned around, preparing to face the enemy.

However.

The figure had just pounced two meters in front of him when it immediately stopped in its tracks and bared its teeth at him, roaring angrily\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

It was that little leopard\!

It seemed to be saying, "Little thief\! Little thief\! Put down that pig, it's mine\!"

When Chu Xiaoye saw that it was her, he first heaved a sigh of relief, but then he was shocked. Since this little fellow was here, the female leopard was definitely here too\!

The reason why the female leopard had let go of its prey and given it to the hyenas was actually to save this little fellow\!

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay any longer. He immediately picked up the giant forest pig from the ground and prepared to leave.

The leopard's hunting and ambushing skills were not something the hyenas could compare to\!

The female leopard was nowhere to be seen and might be hiding somewhere. She was preparing to suddenly jump out and give him a fatal blow\!

Although he was very strong, if he could not react in time and his throat was suddenly bitten by the female leopard, he would be doomed\!

Therefore, he had to leave as soon as possible.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

Seeing that he was about to escape, the little leopard quickly gathered her courage and chased after him. She cried out angrily again, but did not dare to really pounce on him.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and pointed his butt at her. He curled his tail, turned around, and glared at her threateningly.

When the little leopard saw this, her expression changed. With a whoosh, she hurriedly jumped up and turned to escape\!

She had already been traumatized by this shameless thief's butt\!

She swore that she would never let that smelly fart emitting black smoke contaminate her cute little face again\!

Chu Xiaoye did not fart again.

After scaring her away, he immediately picked up the giant forest pig and left in a hurry.

The little leopard ran into the bushes and hid behind her mother. When she saw that the shameless thief had escaped, she hurriedly jumped out of the bushes and whimpered.

It was as if she was saying, "Damn thief\! The thief who likes to fart\! Just you wait\! If I don't take revenge, I swear I won't be a leopard\!"

The female leopard squatted in the grass and watched Chu Xiaoye's retreating figure, then looked at the hyena that was still crying out miserably. Her eyes were filled with bewilderment.

Were lions so powerful nowadays?

They were still underage but could already kill hyenas alone?

She turned around and looked at her daughter with a worried expression.

Her future survival would be even more difficult.

Chu Xiaoye bit the giant forest pig and quietly approached the bushes that hid the beehive. Then, he climbed onto a big tree at the side.

After climbing to the highest branch, he aimed at the grass closest to the bushes below. He loosened his mouth and the giant forest pig in his mouth immediately fell and landed heavily on the ground.

"Bang\!"

With a muffled sound, the grass swayed\!

This commotion immediately alarmed the poisonous bees resting in the bushes\!

"Buzz…"

The densely packed poisonous bees immediately moved out and attacked the huge forest pig on the ground crazily.

Their venom quickly entered the body of the giant forest pig, and the honey on their feet was also smeared on the skin of the giant forest pig\!

The preserving work was officially activated\!

There were also many venomous bees flying in the air, patrolling the surroundings, looking for other enemies.

Chu Xiaoye hid in the dense foliage at the top of the tree and held his breath. Even his heart stopped beating as he waited motionlessly.

In the orchard not far away, the hyena's miserable and desperate cries were still echoing weakly.

The pride was alarmed.

The lion, the cold father, rushed back and walked into the forest. He circled around the beehive region and walked towards the orchard.

He already knew where the bees' nest was and heard the buzzing sounds here. Naturally, he did not dare to pass by here again.

For some reason, when Chu Xiaoye hid on the tall tree and watched as he walked towards the orchard, he was a little worried about the leopard and daughter pair.

If they were discovered by the lion, the female leopard might be able to escape, but the young leopard would definitely die.

Perhaps it was because the little leopard had given him food twice when he was extremely hungry.

After all, he was once a human and he had gratefulness and gentleness in his heart.

However.

In this situation, he could only pray in his heart and could not change anything.

Furthermore, he was only a lion now, a lion that worked hard to survive.

All competitors should be treated as enemies.

Not far away, the roar of a lion and the scream of a hyena in despair came from the orchard.

When enemies meet, they must try killing each other\!

Not long after.

The lion returned to the pride's camp with the dead hyena in its mouth, roaring as if it was showing off its strength to the lionesses, the cubs, and the distant neighbors.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei woke up on the Baobab tree. They were a little anxious when they saw that Chu Xiaoye had disappeared.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was still hiding on the big tree beside the beehive and did not dare to move.

The preserving work was over.

The venomous bees started to return to their nest after venting their anger.

In the grass, the pitiful giant forest pig had already been marinated with bee venom and honey. It was preparing to wait for the next day's air drying.
