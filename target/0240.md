Chapter 240: Turtle in a jar

"Boom\!"

The huge sea python landed heavily on the shore and suddenly swung its tail, sending a few grassland lions flying.

On the scale behind its head, there was a scale that was flickering with a milky white light. It looked rather demonic.

Its bloody mouth was filled with sharp fangs and its scarlet tongue was like a sharp arrow. It jumped out of its mouth with a whoosh and pierced through the head of a wild dog\!

The formation on the shore was immediately messed up by it.

This huge sea python shook its head and wagged its tail, invincible. In a moment, it slaughtered many grassland animals.

"Whoosh\!"

At this moment, a white figure suddenly shot over and pounced at it\!

Tilly's golden claws flickered with a cold light under the sun. She cut through the sky like a meteor and landed on the tail of the giant sea python\!

"Chi—"

An ear-piercing sound rang out and a series of sparks flashed.

Tilly's golden claws did not penetrate the scales on the tail of the giant sea python. They only left a few white marks on the scales\!

"Whoosh\!"

The huge sea python suddenly swung its tail and slapped viciously at Tilly\!

Tilly blocked with her two golden claws and was sent flying with a bang. Her body rolled a few times in the air and she landed lightly on the ground.

She rushed up again.

The huge sea python seemed to know how powerful she was. It did not dare to split its attention to kill other animals and jumped towards her.

At this moment, after Chu Xiaoye killed dozens of sea pythons and helped the wild dogs out of trouble, he hurriedly turned around and returned, charging towards the huge sea python.

Catherine followed closely.

Two golden claws and a pair of silver claws instantly lit up in front and behind the giant sea python\!

"Chi\!"

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw grabbed the tail of the giant sea python fiercely, but it still did not penetrate its scales.

The huge sea python was opening its bloody mouth to attack Tilly. After feeling the threat on its tail, it suddenly swung its thick tail and slapped Chu Xiaoye heavily.

Chu Xiaoye did not take it head-on. He immediately jumped up and dodged it.

At this moment, Catherine rushed up from the side. When the huge sea python swung its tail to show its abdomen, she grabbed at its abdomen with a whoosh\!

"Sss —"

The giant sea python's body suddenly trembled and let out a sharp hissing sound. It immediately turned around and its bright red tongue shot towards Catherine like a poisonous arrow\!

Catherine immediately rolled back and dodged it narrowly\!

There was blood on her right claw.

She had scratched a hole in the abdomen of the huge sea python and blood was flowing out.

It was furious. It immediately put down Tilly and pounced at Catherine.

Catherine stopped attacking and used her agile movements to dodge quickly.

At this moment, Tilly and Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to charge up again\!

"Whoosh\!"

Their golden claws were raised high and fell at the same time, grabbing fiercely at the tail of this huge sea python. They accurately landed at the place where a few white marks had been scratched on it\!

"Pfft—"

Blood suddenly sprayed out\!

The huge sea python's thick and agile tail was finally cut off by their combined strength\!

The huge sea python suddenly jumped up in pain and turned around to bite Chu Xiaoye. The bright red tongue in its bloody mouth trembled violently.

However, before it could pounce over, Catherine had already used this opportunity to rush close with a whoosh and suddenly jump. With a silver flash, her sharp claws pierced through the muscles of its abdomen, like blades cutting tofu. With a whoosh, she opened its stomach\!

Blood and internal organs sprayed out.

"Bam\!"

It fell heavily to the ground, twisted its body violently a few times, and died\!

After Catherine landed, she did not stop and pounced at the other sea pythons.

Tilly looked at her back with a burning gaze, and her thoughts became even more determined.

She had to get this lioness cub\!

The animals on the coast were attacked by the dense sea python army and strange fish groups and suffered heavy casualties.

Fortunately, the rhinoceroses and elephants rushed over. Their huge size and strength blocked all the enemies that were charging crazily and they could not move an inch\!

The snow mountain team on the island also returned.

Hence, this group of sea enemies were blocked from the front and back and surrounded here. They could only risk their lives and make the last struggle.

The sea python king, which was nearly twenty meters long, could only abandon its companions and flee into the sea in a hurry when it saw this scene.

When the rhinoceroses and elephants appeared, the white male tiger, Locke, who was standing on the island, had an ugly expression.

Obviously, the plan had failed.

His brother should have been discovered.

As for the secret passageway, it seemed to be blocked.

Otherwise, the reinforcements that rushed over from the land would never be this group of powerful rhinoceroses and elephants, but another group of sea pythons and strange fish.

They had originally planned to attack from the front and back, making the snow mountain teams on these islands and shore a turtle in a jar. Now, their efforts had been wasted.

He did not hesitate and immediately brought his subordinates away via another secret passageway.

There was no place for them here.

They could not return to the snow mountain.

However, behind the snow mountain, there were more grassland and forests that were enough for them to survive.

That vast forest was not a place the king of the snow mountain could interfere in. There was another king there—the king of the forest\!

Since the mission had failed, they could only return.

They belonged there to begin with.

The reason why he lived here was naturally because of the mission to snatch the position of the owner of the snow mountain.

Soon, they disappeared from the island.

The snow eagle circled in the sky and used a loud cry to command the rhinoceroses and elephants, not letting go of any enemy.

These reinforcements were naturally found by Tilly's rhinoceroses.

Since he had seen through the white tiger's trick, he naturally had to take precautions and move the army over to guard. However, he happened to encounter this battle.

Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Under the absence of the leader and being attacked from the front and back by the snow mountain team, the sea python army and the strange fish were instantly in chaos. They no longer had any fighting spirit, panicked, and fled everywhere.

This way, it would be easier for the snow mountain army to kill.

Soon, the shallows and the shore were filled with mangled corpses. The entire shallow water was dyed red with blood and looked terrifying.

Tilly was already panting from the battle. Her entire body was covered in blood and her claws were limp. She had almost exhausted her strength.

She fought endlessly for nearly four hours without stopping at all. She did not even know how many enemies she had killed.

Wherever the golden claw passed, there were broken limbs.

She turned around and was stunned.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine were still brandishing their claws and chasing after the enemy. They did not look tired at all. Instead, they seemed to be growing braver and more excited as they fought, as if they had endless strength.

Tilly raised her golden claws and felt a little heavy. Her back was aching and her limbs were trembling. She really could not fight anymore.

However, why were the two of them still full of energy?

Indeed, these two fellows were not simple.

He could not let them leave\!

However, these two fellows were stubborn and could not listen to anything. No temptation was useful to them. What could be used to make them stay willingly?

This was a headache.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and the head of a strange fish was cut in half\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped up again and pounced at another strange fish. His raised golden claws flickered with a charming luster under the sun.

Tilly looked at this figure, at his sharp golden claws, and then lowered her head to look at her golden claws. Her light blue eyes turned and her eyes suddenly lit up as she thought of a solution.
