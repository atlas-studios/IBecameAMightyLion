Chapter 154: The Cute Violent Bear

At this moment.

Escaping was clearly useless and unwise.

The panda mother immediately protected the panda cub behind her. She leaned against the water and bared her teeth. She stood up and made herself look tall and fierce.

The white wolves on the other side of the pool could not cross the water.

The reason why they appeared there was to prevent the panda mother and son from jumping into the water and escaping from there.

They were in charge of blocking their retreat.

The white wolves on the panda and her son's side were the true warriors who would charge forward.

The wolves were very united and had a plan. Their division of labor was also very clear.

Although the panda mother looked fierce, there were many wolves and they were heavy. They had come for revenge, so they naturally would not retreat.

"Roar —"

The wolf on the other side of the pool immediately sent out a signal to attack.

It stood by the pool, its snow-white fur clean and smooth. It was tall and strong and looked beautiful and dignified.

The ten-over white wolves that surrounded the panda and her son immediately rushed up.

The panda mother swung her heavy claws and slapped it\!

"Bang\!"

A white wolf was slapped in the head and fell to the side.

The other white wolves took the opportunity to pounce on the panda mother and started biting her crazily.

The panda mother let out an angry roar. As she bit, she slapped her thick claws fiercely.

Because the panda's body was round and fat, and its fur was thick, the wolves could not find any fatal spots. The strangle the wolves used to kill their prey was useless to the fat mother panda whose neck could not be seen.

Therefore, it almost did not need to defend. All it needed to do was swing its claws and open its sharp teeth. As it lashed out, it bit\!

The strength of a bear's paw was something all animals did not dare to withstand easily. Even the king of the forest, the tiger, sometimes had to retreat, let alone these white wolves.

The few white wolves that pounced first were immediately dizzy from the slap. They swayed and retreated.

A white wolf was slapped in the mouth and its mouth was immediately filled with blood and its teeth fell out. As for a white wolf, just as it jumped in front of it, it was slapped away before it could land. It fell into the water at the back and drowned alive.

"Roar —"

The lead wolf on the other side of the pool immediately sent out another signal.

The remaining white wolves immediately split into two groups.

They surged up and pounced on the panda mother, biting her from all over her body.

Another wave followed the stream and rushed up from the side, pouncing on the panda cub\!

The panda mother was furious. She ignored the few white wolves that were biting her and turned around with the white wolves to pounce on the despicable people who were preparing to attack her children\!

A few white wolves were hanging on its body, but it was still extremely fierce. With a slap, it sent the first white wolf flying and fell into the water.

Then, it started to bite the few white wolves hanging on it.

Seeing how fierce and terrifying it was, the white wolves immediately let go and retreated in panic.

They gathered together and panted as they looked at the panda and her son in front of them, terrified and unwilling.

They were not prepared to give up.

The panda mother was covered in wounds and her snow-white fur was dyed red.

However, it still bared its sharp teeth and protected the panda cub. Its round eyes were filled with a fierce and desperate expression\!

Its originally simple and honest appearance became a little ferocious and terrifying at this moment.

Although this was the case, the wolf pack knew that it could not hold on for long.

They only needed to continue harassing for a while before this ferocious enemy would fall because of his injuries and exhaustion.

They had plenty of patience\!

The tall and beautiful wolf stood on a rock on the other side of the pool and stared coldly at the panda and her son, as if it was going to eat them.

The panda mother landed on all fours and panted heavily as she retreated to the panda cub's side.

At this moment, it felt the pain of its wounds.

Perhaps because it had used too much strength, or because it was in too much pain, or perhaps because of fear and despair, its body was trembling slightly.

It let out a low growl and continued to threaten the group of enemies.

It really wanted to rest for a while.

However, the lead wolf opposite clearly would not give it this chance.

"Roar —"

The lead wolf let out a long roar and ordered his companions to continue attacking in one go.

Just as this group of white wolves were about to continue pouncing and biting, a figure suddenly appeared on the hill.

The rumbling sound of the waterfall covered many sounds, but it could not hide some special aura and those natural auras.

Chu Xiaoye walked down the hill.

Two adult lions with lush manes and tall bodies that had recovered some of their might followed behind him.

A plump little elephant carried a female cub and walked in the middle.

At the back were two small jackals.

This was a strange group.

However, their aura was not inferior to that of any carnivore\!

The wolf pack raised their heads and stared blankly at this strange group of uninvited guests. They suddenly felt uneasy.

Especially the three animals at the front.

Their auras made them panic.

They lived in this dense and vast forest all year round and had never seen such a creature.

However, the wolf on the other side of the pool and the few old wolves behind it were shocked.

When they saw Chu Xiaoye and the two tall and strong adult lions behind him, instinctive fear immediately attacked their hearts.

They had once gone to the edge of the forest and seen such animals on the grassland.

This was the king of the grassland\!

Be it their size, strength, combat skills, or even teamwork, the wolves could never be compared to the lions.

They looked at the panda and her son and knew that their efforts tonight would be wasted.

Be it in the forest with lush vegetation or the grassland that could be seen everywhere, only the strongest were qualified to enjoy food.

They could only give up this panda feast.

"Roar —"

The lead wolf did not hesitate and immediately called out, ordering his companions opposite to retreat.

They were already injured. If they stayed any longer, they would only die.

When the wolf pack heard the order, they immediately turned around and quickly left without any hesitation.

The panda mother stared blankly at their retreating figures, then turned around and looked at the unfamiliar group of non-mainstreams walking down the hill. Her eyes were filled with bewilderment.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in front of them and stared at them with a burning gaze. He sized them up impolitely, wanting nothing more than to get a bar of soap and press the mother and son into the water to wash them. He wanted to see if they were real pandas or if they were deliberately dyed like this by humans.

He had seen it before. Some weirdos had actually dyed their dogs' eyes black and dressed them up as pandas.

This mother and son might be imposters too.

However, no matter how he looked at them, this mother and son pair seemed to be genuine iron-eating beasts.

However, why were they here?

Was it because this primitive forest was uninhabited to begin with, or was it because humans transported them to the grassland from elsewhere and they crossed the mountains themselves and ran over?

However, from the panda mother's fishing skills and combat skills just now, it did not seem to be a panda in his heart.

It seemed to have lived in this dangerous environment since young.

Otherwise, why would she have such strong courage and skills?

Perhaps, they were another species.

Just like domestic dogs, wild dogs, gray bears, black bears, polar bears, and so on.

Pandas were also bears. Perhaps, this was another type of bear that was adorable and fierce.

Why not call it the cute violent bear?

Anyway, he was the one who discovered it first, so he naturally had the right to name it.

This cute violent bear mother looked to be seriously injured. However, she could only rely on her tenacious life force to survive.

Since they could survive here, they naturally had their own way of survival.

Many animals that lived in the forest knew about healing herbs. Every time they were injured, they would find those herbs to heal themselves.

Chu Xiaoye believed that this mother could definitely survive by relying on herself.

She had to survive.

Because she still had children to feed.

In order to see this animal clearly, Chu Xiaoye had already broken the natural rules and helped them scare away the wolf pack. Therefore, he could not continue to help them.

He looked at the mother and son for the last time. Just as he was about to leave, the cute violent bear cub suddenly ran out from behind its mother with the unfinished fish head in its mouth. It ran in front of Chu Xiaoye and put down the fish head, signaling him to eat.

His round eyes, black eye circles, and round body made him look adorable.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but raise his claws and prepare to touch its head.

At this moment, the cute violent bear mother immediately roared and stared at him in panic and vigilance.

"Roar—"

The Chino brothers behind Chu Xiaoye immediately roared at her with fierce expressions.

The cute violent bear mother trembled in fear and shrank her neck. Her entire body was trembling, and her gaze was still fixed on Chu Xiaoye's raised claw.

Chu Xiaoye looked at his claws and thought of something sad.

His claws without claws looked so miserable. He could not climb trees or catch enemies. He could not even scratch an itch. How depressing.

He was not interested in fish, let alone fish heads.

He put down his claws and grinned at the cute violent bear in front of him. He bared his fangs and pretended to be fierce.

He had to let it know that the person in front of it was a ferocious beast that even wolves feared. He could not treat him as a friend.

The cute violent bear looked at his fangs in a daze. Then, it opened its mouth and bared its thin fangs, indicating that it had them too and was better looking.

Good looking my ass\!

His teeth were still stuffed with fish intestines\!

Chu Xiaoye rolled his eyes at it and turned to walk down the mountain.

On the grassland, This King is here\!
