Chapter 5: Battle\!

"Roar—"

The female lion, Xi'er, immediately tensed up. She took a few steps forward and stood in front of the young cubs, baring her fangs and roaring at those despicable ambushers\!

The lion had already run far away to chase away the hyenas at another direction. He definitely would not be able to return in such a short time\!

Most of these young cubs were six to seven months old.

The oldest was only a year old.

To these cunning and cruel hyenas, there was no threat at all.

They could only be treated as a sumptuous meal\!

Therefore, she was the only one who could fight now\!

But.

With so many ambushers, she could barely take care of herself. How could she protect these eight young cubs?

Xi'er's heart was filled with despair and fear.

However, she would never give up\!

"Whoosh\!"

She took the initiative to attack and decided to fight to the death to stop these damn hyenas outside. Otherwise, they would get close to the cubs\!

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch and saw that the hyenas were getting closer and closer. He hurriedly gestured to Little Curly Tail and the other cubs below to let them climb up the tree quickly\!

The smart Mei Mei was the first to rush up\!

Just like last night, the little lioness ran up the tree and landed on the first branch easily.

Little Curly Tail was the second to rush up. He was much more agile than last night.

Clearly, fear had stimulated this kid's potential\!

As for the other five young cubs, they surrounded the tree and clumsily and fearfully probed a few times, but were unable to climb up. They looked like they were at a loss and were at the mercy of the hyenas\!

At this moment\!

Xi 'er had already pounced towards the cackle of hyenas\!

The seven or eight hyenas were extremely cunning. They immediately split up and ran towards the young cubs from different directions\!

Since they had been discovered, they did not hide anymore. They cackled and ran over excitedly at their fastest speed, preparing to enjoy the feast of young cubs\!

Xi'er ran back in a hurry, roaring in despair\!

She could not do it alone\!

However, this also stimulated her courage to go all out. With a roar, she suddenly jumped up and pounced at the closest hyena\!

Under normal circumstances, female lions would not fight to the death with hyenas.

Especially lionesses that had children that needed to be fed.

When hyenas were injured, they had companions and could eat rotten meat with them.

If a lion was injured, it could only wait for death.

A lion and other female lions would never let a disabled lion share their precious food.

In fact, they would even cruelly drive her out of the pride to save their limited food and resources.

However, Xi'er could not care less now.

None of the eight cubs must die\!

She pounced on the hyena and bit its neck, rolling on the ground with it\!

The other hyenas immediately tucked their tails between their legs and paused.

However, they only paused for a moment before running towards the young cubs again.

They were too hungry\!

At this moment\!

Chu Xiaoye had already jumped down from the tree. He used his head to push against the butt of a cub and used all his strength to push it up the first branch\!

There were still four cubs\!

"Climb\! Climb\!"

He let out a childish roar, jumped down the tree again, and lifted the second cub\!

When he pushed the second cub onto the tree, he was so tired that he was panting and his limbs felt like jelly\!

However, he quickly retreated once again and picked up the third one\!

"Climb\! Climb\!"

He shouted in his heart, exhausted\!

Finally, the third cub went up too\!

But\!

There were still two more under the tree\!

At this moment, a hyena was drooling as it ran over excitedly\!

Xi'er pushed a hyena down and pushed another down after that\!

Although she had bitten their throats, if she did not continue biting, they would still stand back up\!

The hyena's life force was extremely tenacious\!

However, Xi'er had no time to kill them. She could only pounce on one then quickly pounce on and bite another\!

She hoped to scare them or attract their hatred\!

Indeed\!

The hyena that she had pounced on previously had blood dripping from its neck. It stood up, bared its teeth, and pounced at her with hatred\!

Immediately, three crazy hyenas surrounded her and started biting her viciously\!

Xi'er's legs, butt, face, and body were soon covered in blood\!

The three hyenas were not any better.

Every one of them had a head full of blood. One of the hyenas had its chin bitten through, but it continued to bite fearlessly\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, there were still two frightened and desperate cubs under the tree.

At this moment, an ugly hyena was already drooling and it pounced over\!

At this critical moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down from the tree. He swayed in front of the hyena then turned to run\!

The hyena was stunned for a moment before it immediately turned around and chased after him\!

Chu Xiaoye was the closest to it, and he was also a young lion cub. He was so slow that it looked comical\!

The hyena believed that it only needed a few steps to catch up to Chu Xiaoye\!

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Little Curly immediately jumped down from the tree. He hurriedly pushed against the fourth cub's butt and struggled to push it up\!

As for the last cub, it had already fallen to the ground in fright. It did not show any signs of wanting to climb the tree\!

Even when Little Curly Tail went down, he was not able to push the cub up the tree\!

Currently, the panting Little Curly Tail could no longer care about it. Instead, he looked at his brother nervously and fearfully.

His brother was being chased by a super scary hyena\!

He was so scared that his entire body was trembling\!

Mei Mei stood on the second branch and whimpered. She looked at her mother, who was covered in wounds, and then at Chu Xiaoye, who was about to be pounced on by a hyena. Her face was filled with fear\!

"Whoosh\!"

Just as the terrifying hyena leaped up ferociously and was about to pounce on Chu Xiaoye, Chu Xiaoye suddenly stopped, turned around, crawled under the hyena's crotch, and ran towards the big tree at the side\!

"God bless me\! I only have one chance\!"

Chu Xiaoye prayed in his heart. He gritted his teeth and used all his strength. He suddenly jumped up high and jumped onto the tree trunk. His four sharp claws grabbed onto the bark as he quickly climbed up\!

Using the force of his charge, he actually climbed up the tree's branches in one move\!

At this moment, the hyena that had been played had already turned back and caught up to him. It raised its head, bared its teeth, and looked angrily at Chu Xiaoye on the tree. It let out an angry and embarrassed scream\!

"Pui\!"

Chu Xiaoye lay limp on the branch, breathing heavily as he spat at the hyena.

He looked up and saw another young cub lying on the ground, shivering in fear.

The other hyenas had already run over.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he sighed to himself.

He had already tried his best.

He could not be blamed for not being able to save his last friend.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, Xi 'er, who had been fighting three hyenas, suddenly ran back covered in blood\!

With a sudden leap, she landed under the small tree. Then, she turned around and protected the shivering cub under her abdomen. With her butt facing the small tree and her mouth facing the hyenas that were running close, she bared her fangs and let out a terrifying roar\!

Not only was her badly mutilated face bleeding, but it was also showing a terrifying expression of death. The few hyenas that had run near her were so frightened that they suddenly stopped in their tracks and hid their tails, not daring to take another step forward\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas cried out anxiously and angrily for their other companions\!

After a while, the other injured hyenas surrounded them\!

The eight hyenas bared their teeth and howled at Xi'er fiercely and fearfully, trying to break her fighting spirit\!

However, even though Xi 'er was covered in wounds and covered in blood, she still protected the shivering lion cub. She bared her fangs and refused to back down\!

Her single eye, which was dyed red with blood, was filled with an expression of facing death with equanimity\!

The young cubs on the tree and her daughter were silent. They lowered their heads and looked at her in a daze.

Chu Xiaoye, who was sitting on the tree, was also stunned.

This was motherly love and responsibility\!

Be it humans or animals, they all had such great and tragic feelings\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly came from afar\!

The majestic lion, with its mane flying and fangs bared, finally returned with a murderous aura\!

The hyenas immediately dispersed\!
