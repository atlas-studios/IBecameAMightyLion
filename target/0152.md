Chapter 152: New World\!

"Roar—"

He had just walked not far when Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily. He jumped down from the little elephant's back and pounced on a deer that was watching by the road\!

Just as the deer was in a daze, he had already bitten its neck and brought it back to the elephant's back.

Then, he turned around and faced the little animals following behind him, starting to eat heartily.

He was a lion\!

It was natural for lions to eat meat\!

When the little animals saw this scene, they were first stunned, but then they rushed forward with a whoosh and panicked, running for their lives.

It turned out that this was a ferocious beast that ate meat\!

Only the jackal couple still followed behind with respectful looks.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and ignored them. Soon, he ate the muscles on the deer's two legs and handed the remaining corpse to Doya.

Doya immediately lowered her head and leaned over in a fawning manner. She wanted to rub his neck, but he slapped her away.

Chu Xiaoye did not like to eat internal organs.

Doya did not seem to like it either. Furthermore, she was very smart and sensible. After taking a few bites, she threw the deer's corpse down with difficulty.

The Chino brothers immediately wolfed down the food.

The remaining dregs on the ground were eaten clean by the jackal couple at the back.

Soon, not even its fur was left.

They walked from night to day.

They walked from dawn to dusk.

On the evening of the third day, after crossing a forest of boulders, they finally stood on the mountain range.

A cool evening breeze brought with it a salty and wet smell.

Looking over, there was a huge basin on the other side of the mountain. In the middle was a vast and flat grassland, and around it was a dense forest.

In the middle of the basin, a river ran through the grassland like a silver belt.

Lakes of all sizes were everywhere on the grassland.

At the far end was an endless sea.

This region was surrounded by a few volcanoes and bordered the vast ocean. It was like spring all year round and there was plenty of rain. There was no dry season.

Every time the airflow of the sea turned into clouds and drifted past the grassland, it would be blocked by the few majestic volcanoes, causing the rain to fall directly on this basin and not reach the side of the mountain.

Therefore, the scenery and climate on both sides of the mountain were different.

The animals living on both sides of the mountain range were like children who were born poor or rich. Some worked hard their entire lives to fill their stomachs, while others played for their entire lives without having to worry about food and drink.

However, the poor had their competition, and the rich had their competition.

No matter which side of the mountain range the animals lived on, competition was inevitable.

Their competition was usually filled with bloody battles. They would either die or be injured.

No matter how rich a place was, its resources were limited.

The natural rules of the survival of the fittest were everywhere.

Only the most powerful could not be eliminated by this rich land.

Looking at the vast green grassland in the distance, Chu Xiaoye's dream flew into the sky and drifted through the sea of clouds, looking at the future.

That was where he would show his ambition\!

His journey as a king was about to start\!

However.

Before that, he needed to leave the team and go to a secluded place to pee.

This was naturally not the mark of the beginning of the Lion King's journey, nor was it marking the borders of the territory arrogantly.

It was just excrement.

He walked nearly 100 meters away and squatted under a weathered rock. As he thought of what would happen next, he exerted strength.

Just as he was feeling comfortable, a strong wind suddenly came from above him and shot towards him\!

"Whoosh\!"

Before he could react, two sharp claws that were as hard as steel grabbed his neck and butt, instantly bringing him off the ground\!

In the blink of an eye\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He immediately felt a sharp pain from his neck and butt\!

He looked up and saw that the attacker was a huge strange bird\!

Its spread wings were actually three meters long\!

On its head, there were bright red feathers that looked like a chicken crown. Its sharp mouth flickered with a silver luster under the sun. The feathers on its body were as blue and beautiful as the ocean\!

Its strength was clearly extraordinary\!

Even though Chu Xiaoye already weighed nearly 100 kilograms, he was still instantly sent flying\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly twisted his body and struggled with all his might. At the same time, he endured the pain and raised his neck with all his might, using his head to hit its claws, making it unable to maintain its balance\!

The strange bird finally slowed down and its flying height started to gradually decrease\!

However, it still flapped its wings vigorously, unwilling to give up this delicious meal that it had obtained\!

He was only three to four meters away from the ground\!

Chu Xiaoye could not let it continue to fly higher. Otherwise, even if he broke free, he would be smashed to death\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and twisted his body even more.

Because he was excreting just now, he did not have the time to react. He did not finish excrement and did not have the time to retract it. Hence, in this moment of panic and fear, the feces immediately could not help but appear from behind\!

At this moment,the little elephant was carrying Doya and running with the Chino brothers anxiously while looking up.

When the feces scattered in the wind and fell down, it happened to land on them.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the mood to see them make a fool of themselves. As he struggled with all his might, he finally made the strange bird on him lose its balance and land crookedly\!

He immediately used all his might. As he twisted his neck and butt, he even swung his tail with all his might. His limbs were also bouncing in the air, and he finally slowly touched the ground.

When the strange bird flapped its wings and loosened its claws, preparing to give up, he suddenly raised his head and jumped up, biting its thigh. He swung his neck fiercely and threw it to the ground with a bang\!

The strange bird hurriedly flapped its wings on the ground and prepared to fly up again\!

At this moment, the jackal couple with feces on their heads ran over first and bit its open wings\!

Although the jackals were small, their teeth were exceptionally sharp and pierced through the strange bird's wings\!

The Chino brothers also rushed over at lightning speed. They suddenly jumped up and pounced on the strange bird, biting its neck\!

Chu Xiaoye's face twitched when he saw his brothers' faces covered in feces and emitting a smell that even he could not tolerate.

At this moment, the little elephant ran over with its nose raised. It stepped on the strange bird's head and crushed it, causing it to die\!

The little elephant raised its nose proudly and revealed the smelly feces on its nostrils.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked behind. He grinned and could not bear to look at her.
