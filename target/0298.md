Chapter 298: King of farts

"Whoosh—"

Catherine flew out and fell miserably on the grass four to five meters away.

The murderous mosquitoes in the air were instantly enveloped by the black smoke. The buzzing sound from their flapping wings stopped\!

One-eyed brought the pride and rushed behind Chu Xiaoye. Just as he was about to continue fleeing in panic, he suddenly realized that the terrifying mosquitoes seemed to have stopped moving.

They stopped in their tracks and turned around. They stood behind Chu Xiaoye and looked at the black smoke in bewilderment.

When the black smoke gradually dissipated, they were shocked to discover that the terrifying mosquitoes had suddenly disappeared\!

Chu Xiaoye walked over and looked down at the ground.

At this moment, One-eyed and the members of the pride were shocked to see that the terrifying mosquitoes were all black as they landed on the ground and died\!

The group of terrifying killers, who had chased them until they fled in fear, were actually completely wiped out. They all died in the black smoke and under the king's fart\!

The king's fart was actually so powerful\!

Looking at the mosquito corpses all over the ground, Chu Xiaoye finally relaxed.

Indeed, everything had its nemesis.

His fart was the nemesis of this group of bloodthirsty giant mosquitoes\!

With a way to deal with these mosquitoes, he did not have to worry anymore.

His farts were endless. As long as he ate and breathed, there would be farts.

He was not afraid of any more mosquitoes.

Catherine got up from the grass and came behind him with a sorry look.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in a very good mood. He wanted to ask how his fart tasted, but after thinking about it, he felt that he should not go overboard.

Although this female cub was loyal to him, obedient, and could be beaten, scolded, or bullied at will, he would feel uneasy if he did this.

He still could not let his guard down tonight.

Chu Xiaoye let everyone go back to rest and be on guard at all times.

He left with Catherine and continued to mark the territory.

To a lion, marking its territory was a very honorable and tiring job.

In order to leave their scent on the borders of the territory, many lions would usually go out for a week, or even half a month.

Chu Xiaoye had always hated this job.

However, he had to use this opportunity to check every pride in every territory.

He had observed the members of the pride secretly just now. Catherine also took the opportunity to glance at their abdomen when she fell into the grass. However, she did not discover any abnormalities.

He still had a long way to go.

The sky turned bright in the distance.

This night finally passed.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine to the foot of the mountain and the territory near the river.

A group of old lions lay on the hill by the river, looking at the river below, at the moon in the night sky, and at the darkness in the distance. The atmosphere was silent.

No one knew if they were recalling their youths as majestic lion kings that had once roamed the grassland or if they were thinking about the short time they had left.

Two old lions patrolling at the border discovered them and immediately came forward.

They were respectful and grateful to Chu Xiaoye.

"Roar—"

A roar sounded on the grass by the river.

In this territory, all the elderly lions immediately got up and rushed over.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and continued forward, with the two old lions patrolling behind him.

The other lions rushed over one after another and gathered by the river. They stood neatly and welcomed him respectfully and excitedly. Their originally muddy and sleepy eyes emitted a bright light.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the group of old lions that had recovered and could not help but be moved.

He did not stand on ceremony and walked in front of them with an encouraging expression. At the same time, he instructed Catherine to check.

Catherine circled the elderly pride and did not deliberately do anything.

Although the elderly lions were a little puzzled, they stood respectfully with their heads held high, like soldiers waiting for the king to review his troops.

In order to not let these soldiers who had just made great contributions feel disappointed, Chu Xiaoye walked to the foot of the hill near the river. Under the gaze of everyone, he peed and expressed that he was here to mark the borders of the territory and had no other intentions.

To lions, the most unbearable thing was for other lions to leave their scent in their territory.

However, this was not any other lion but their king\!

If Chu Xiaoye left his scent here, it meant that he had never treated this group of old and useless lions as an abandoned team and really treated them as his pride.

Therefore, when these old lions saw him pee and mark the territory, they were even more excited and grateful.

Their efforts that night were worth it\!

At least, this young king did not abandon them and dislike them like those prides. He did not treat them as wandering old lions that were no longer useful.

"Roar—"

They roared like thunder in unison, using the roar of a lion and the aura of a former lion king to express their gratitude and loyalty.

Their old and weak bodies still flowed with blood\!

Chu Xiaoye originally only wanted to pee and express himself casually. Now that he saw that they were actually so excited and encouraged, he could only bite the bullet and continue to pee. Under these old lions' burning gazes, he walked forward.

"Roar—"

The roars of these old lions became even more excited and impassioned\!

Chu Xiaoye had no choice but to continue squeezing his bladder and be embarrassed to stop.

Catherine followed behind him silently with her head lowered and her mouth slightly open. She was actually snickering like a human girl.

Finally, he walked from the front of this team to the back.

Just as he finally heaved a sigh of relief and was about to stop, this group of old lions suddenly turned around and followed behind him neatly, continuing to roar excitedly and hot-bloodedly.

They seemed to be shouting, "King\! Our king\! Come on\! Come on, pee\! We will follow you forever, to the ends of the world, and never betray you\!"

Chu Xiaoye :"…"

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the cold father walked over from afar and let out an angry roar.

This unfilial son actually ran over in the middle of the night to win over his subordinates\! He actually marked his territory in front of his subordinates. Damn it\!

He was the king here\!

Only he was qualified to pee here\!

He widened his eyes in anger and charged over aggressively.

When he rushed close, he walked at the front of the team. Under Catherine's gaze, he roared with the old lions to cheer for this young king.

When Chu Xiaoye saw him, his eyes immediately lit up, as if he had seen his savior.

"Dad, I'll leave the difficult and glorious task of peeing to you\! Only your strong bladder is qualified\!"
