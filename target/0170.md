Chapter 170: The Big Fart Is Here\!

The bright moon was in the sky.

Many rustling sounds came from the bushes.

The little animals that had been sleeping in during the day had all come out to look for food.

Although Chu Xiaoye had just eaten last night, he still felt a little hungry now.

His rapidly growing body and the battle today had almost digested the food in his body completely.

Under the change of the hot current in his body, some of the impurities in the food turned into feces, and some mixed with the impurities in his body and turned into smelly farts.

The smelly farts could be stored and released at will.

However, feces could not be held back.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt a little pleased. He looked around and squatted in the grass.

Perhaps because he was too worried today, he felt a little angry.

Just as he was closing his eyes and opening his mouth to excrete with all his might, a white figure suddenly jumped out from the bushes behind him with a whoosh. It bit his curled tail and suddenly pulled back\!

"Bam\!"

He sat on the ground\!

When he jumped up and turned around, the white figure had already jumped into the bushes and fled\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and furious. He immediately roared and chased after her with his butt full of feces\!

However, the other party was too fast and could not be seen at all.

Bastard\!

Who was it?

If you have the ability, come out and let's fight seriously\!

To attack while others were peeing and pooping, did they have to be shameless?

Obviously, the despicable attacker just now was the same animal as the attacker during the day\!

Damn it\!

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart as he walked to the grass at the side, preparing to wipe the filth on his butt with the grass.

This was too embarrassing\!

He sat on his feces and did not even see what the other party looked like. It was a great humiliation\!

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was about to walk into the grass, the grass suddenly moved. The slender little leopard with smooth fur walked out slowly and looked at him with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. He hurriedly lowered his tail and covered the thing on his butt.

"Roar…"

The little leopard let out a tempting cry. It bent its limbs and lay down. As it wagged its tail, it called out to him softly, like a young girl in heat.

"A good opportunity\!"

Chu Xiaoye thought to himself.

In order to prevent this little leopard from misunderstanding, he immediately revealed a benevolent expression and walked over carefully.

His bright and cunning eyes seemed to be saying, "Sister, don't be afraid. Come, let me check your body."

The little leopard was not afraid at all. It lay on the ground and waited for him.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly happy. Just as he walked close, the little leopard suddenly stood up. Its nostrils fluttered, as if it was smelling something terrifying. Its face, which was filled with obsession just now, suddenly twitched.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat and he cursed inwardly\!

However, this was not the time to be indecisive.

In order to find out the truth, he had to be unscrupulous\!

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly pounced forward and pushed the little leopard to the ground, preparing to see if there were any human marks on her body.

However, the little leopard suddenly smelled an even stronger stench. It gagged and almost vomited\!

She hurriedly struggled and let out a cry for help.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not have any mercy on the fairer sex and suddenly slapped her face to make her behave\!

It was just a physical examination. What was there to struggle about?

"Roar —"

The little leopard was furious. It opened its fangs and bit at him ferociously\!

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her again, causing her head to tilt and she saw stars.

In order to prevent her roar from attracting the male leopard, Chu Xiaoye decided to go all out and use his ultimate move\!

"Bam\!"

This time, it was not the sound of a slap, but the sound of someone sitting on their face\!

The little leopard, who was roaring with its mouth open, instantly went silent. Then, it swung its head with all its might and struggled. In just a few seconds, her head tilted and she fainted.

Chu Xiaoye sat on her face and quickly checked her body.

Soon, the inspection was completed.

There was no human brand on this little leopard.

It seemed that her intelligence had nothing to do with humans. She was either born with it or had encountered something that mutated.

Since she had no problem, there should be no problem with the male leopard.

Suddenly, a sound came from the bushes not far away.

Chu Xiaoye immediately stood up and quickly fled the place.

"Whoosh\!"

The grass moved and the male leopard rushed over with Belita and her daughter.

They heard Belia's cry for help.

However, when they saw Belia, they immediately froze in place.

Belia fainted on the ground, her face covered in unknown objects that were filled with a stench. She looked terrifying\!

"Roar —"

When Belita smelled this familiar smell, she immediately let out an angry and excited roar.

"It's him\! It's him\! It's that big smelly fart\!"

Chu Xiaoye caught a gazelle in the forest. After eating, he brought back some dregs and threw them to Doya.

Doya crawled on the ground and thanked him profusely.

Chu Xiaoye was not sleepy at all. He walked out of the bushes and looked at the distant grassland.

He wondered when the pride would come.

Before he defeated the true lion king, he could not calm down.

Three days later.

The wounds on the Chino brothers were almost healed.

Chu Xiaoye brought them to the borders of the territory and instructed them to pee and mark the territory.

The two brothers were extremely excited. They felt honored and immediately started marking the territory in earnest. They wanted to dig out their bladders and squeeze out the last drop of urine.

This was a tiring job.

Chu Xiaoye gave them a rough location and let them follow this location and divide the border with the bushes as the center. It did not need to be too big.

The two brothers worked for a day. Although they were exhausted, their passion did not decrease. They became more and more excited as they worked. After a short rest, they immediately continued through the night.

This was the dream of every lion.

Chu Xiaoye followed behind them and swayed at the borders of the territory, wanting to see his future neighbors.

However, he did not see any of his own kind.

This was a little strange.

For three consecutive days, the owner of this territory did not move.

No more lions appeared on the surrounding grassland.

As for the hyenas, they all disappeared without a trace.

Chu Xiaoye would not be so arrogant as to think that his might as a king had frightened them.

A pride that could survive in this territory until now was not so easily frightened.

This extraordinary calmness made him even more nervous and vigilant.

However, all he could do now was wait patiently.

He did not forget his training.

Although his speed and strength had increased at a godly speed, they would never be the strongest. They could only get stronger.

After dark.

He returned to the bushes and familiarized himself with the route of the entire forest as he continued to train.

The trees, bushes, and some small animals were his training tools.

This lush forest would become his main battlefield in the future.

He was weak alone and could not compare to those prides. On the flat grassland, if the other party had more lions than him, he was naturally not their match.

However, once he arrived here, he could use all his skills and strength.

Even if they could not defeat him, they could escape easily and their lives would not be in danger.

Therefore, he had to familiarize himself with every corner of this forest.

Mud pits, swamps, horizontal trees, green vines, and so on could all become tools for him to fight his enemies, or even kill them.

"Whoosh—"

Just as he was observing a mud pit full of leaves, a figure suddenly jumped out from the grass in front of him and pounced at a rabbit that was lowering its head to eat sprouts.

The rabbit jumped up in panic, but it still did not escape the figure's sharp claws\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the figure and was stunned for a moment. He immediately walked over.

Before the figure could leave with the rabbit in its mouth, he suddenly roared angrily and pounced forward\!

Belita almost peed her pants\!

She hurriedly abandoned the rabbit and jumped onto a big tree at the side with a whoosh. Her speed was much faster than before\!

However, when she lay on the tree and trembled as she turned her head to look down, she was stunned. She widened her eyes and stared blankly at the familiar figure.

Chu Xiaoye picked up the rabbit and raised his head, looking at her teasingly.

He seemed to be saying, "Girl, you didn't expect this, right? No matter where you run, you won't be able to escape my grasp\!"

"Roar —"

Belita was furious\!

This bastard was like a lingering spirit. He was terrible\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"Big fart\! Return me my rabbit\!"

As Belita called out, she bared her fangs and glared at him fiercely.

Chu Xiaoye placed the rabbit under the tree with his mouth and took a few steps back. He raised his head and called out, as if he was saying, "Alright, I'll return it to you. Come down and eat."

Then, he turned around and prepared to leave.

When he took a few steps forward, Belita immediately climbed down the tree and landed on the ground, biting the rabbit.

However, before she could climb up the tree again, Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and jumped over with a whoosh. He pushed her to the ground and quickly aimed his butt at her head. With a puff, he spewed out black smoke\!

He had said that he had to teach this female leopard a lesson when he saw her again\!

Men always kept their promises\!

The lion king did not joke\!

Let's see if she still dared to be arrogant in front of him in the future\!

After Chu Xiaoye finished farting, he immediately picked up the rabbit and left.

Belita lay on the ground with her eyes wide open. Her entire head was covered in black smoke and she did not move, as if she was petrified.

After a long time, violent vomiting and miserable roars sounded from the forest.
