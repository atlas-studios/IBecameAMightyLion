Chapter 519: Please Love Us\!

"I'm a lion, and I'll take revenge\!"

The moment he was suddenly pierced from behind, he had already sentenced this boy to death.

Even if he did not do it himself, Catherine would do it for him.

Therefore, from the beginning, he had never thought of letting this boy go.

Prince? The Queen's brother? Sorry, he did not recognize this.

He only knew that there was only one path for those who wanted his life—death.

The room was terrifyingly quiet.

No one would have thought that he would suddenly kill him despite saying that he had forgiven him.

Lanisi froze in place, as if she was petrified.

Annie stood at the door with a complicated gaze.

She knew that this young man would not let the matter rest, but she did not expect him to suddenly attack in front of them. Furthermore, it was the dagger he took from the queen's waist when he hugged her.

To the young queen, who had personally seen her first brother killed and her mother killed, this was definitely another heart attack and an extremely cruel thing.

Morris covered his neck, widened his eyes, and twitched on the ground. Soon, he died completely.

This little prince probably never would have thought that he would die in this way.

Blood flowed all over the ground, and the entire room was filled with a strong smell of blood, reminding the few female elves that the only prince of the Elf Kingdom had already left and the murderer was in front of them.

"Your Majesty, my condolences."

Chu Xiaoye comforted her, then said to Catherine, who was beside him, "Let's go, if Your Majesty is willing to let me go."

Catherine looked at the Queen coldly and bared her sharp claws.

Fei'er suddenly walked over and handed him his sword. She looked at him pitifully and said, "Lord Night, your sword. If possible, please… please don't hurt Her Majesty."

The Queen stood very close to them.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine could take the Queen hostage and leave.

However, he did not reach out to take the sword.

He looked at the sword in the pink-haired girl's hand and shook his head. "This is not my sword. When I came, I brought Catherine. When I left, I naturally did not bring anything else."

He lowered his body and transformed into a lion.

The clothes fell to the ground.

All the decorations and things that did not belong to him left his body.

"I came in the form of a lion and left in the form of a lion. Your Majesty, I did not take anything from your elves, other than two lives that must be taken away. However, I also gave you compensation, enough compensation. Now, we don't owe each other anything."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the queen in front of him and said coldly.

Then, he walked past her with Catherine and walked towards the door.

Tears flickered in Fei'er's eyes.

Denise looked at her queen.

Annie, who was standing at the door, suddenly closed the door. Then, she turned around and stood in front of the door, looking at them calmly.

Chu Xiaoye stopped.

Catherine bared her sharp claws and arched her body slightly, preparing to pounce.

Her claws were still sharp\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the girl blocking the door as if he was looking at a stranger.

Annie suddenly opened her mouth and looked at him with trembling eyes. She said softly, "King, don't go. Annie doesn't want you to go."

The coldness in Chu Xiaoye's eyes slowly retreated, but he still said coldly, "Lan Nixi is your king. Annie, you belong here, but I'm not. I belong to the grassland and will always belong to the grassland."

"Night."

The Queen suddenly turned around and looked at him pleadingly. "Don't go… Stay, okay?"

The tense atmosphere in the room suddenly relaxed.

Fei'er hurriedly said, "Lord Night, you promised Lisa that you would stay here and protect us."

Lanisi walked in front of him and slowly squatted down. She reached out and held his hand like before, gently holding his claws. She said softly, "No one will blame you. Morris' death was his own fault, and I won't have any complaints about you. I only have gratitude, respect, and admiration for you. Night, I hope you can stay and help me and us, okay? Please."

The Queen looked at him pitifully like a little girl begging for candy.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in shock and then at the corpse beside the bed. He was silent for a while before slowly shaking his head. "Your Majesty, I'm sorry. I don't trust you. I killed your brother in front of you. Even if you want him to die, I shouldn't have attacked him in front of you. You're a high and mighty queen. I offended you and deserve to die. However, I want to live."

"No, Night."

The Queen also shook her head and squatted in front of him, close to his face. Her fragrance crawled into his nose and she looked at him pleadingly. "You did not offend me, and you're not guilty. What do I have to say to make you believe me?"

At the door, Annie suddenly said, "Sister, let me send out the queen's decree. You're 17 years old. It's time to get married…"

The Queen looked up at her in shock.

Annie said softly, "Sister, you need Night."

The Queen lowered her head and looked at the lion in front of her.

Annie also looked at Chu Xiaoye and said, "Tomorrow, the entire elf race will know that the benefactor who saved all of them and gave the entire elf race hope is going to marry their queen, protect them together, and protect the entire elf race. I believe that everyone will be jumping for joy and sincerely bless you."

In this case, all his doubts and worries would disappear.

The Queen could not go back on her word, because the entire elf race would not agree.

Fei'er said happily, "Your Majesty, I'll inform the others with the princess."

The Queen sighed and said, "Annie, you should ask Night first. I have no objections and will be extremely honored."

She could sacrifice everything for the elves. When she destroyed the Orc bridge, she had already given up her life and everything. Now, she was naturally willing.

Furthermore, this young man was so outstanding and was the hope of their entire elf race. She should be happy and feel fortunate.

As for this young man's identity, she did not care.

The elves were said to have evolved from some small animal. Furthermore, he was not only a lion, but also an elf.

"You're joking, right?"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly said, then pulled out his claws from the queen's hand and looked at her. "I said that I'm only a lion. Furthermore, even if I become an elf and like elf girls, I don't dare to marry a high and mighty queen who has authority and can change her face at any time. I like freedom. I've said it long ago."

The Queen looked at Annie with a bitter smile and said, "See, he's unwilling."

Annie fell silent.

Fei'er, who was at the side, said anxiously, "Lord Night, if you're afraid of the Queen, please consider Princess Nalia. Princess Nalia likes freedom just like you. You two can definitely be together well."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said, "There's no difference between a princess and a queen. If I really have to choose, Fei'er, I'll choose you. You're a lively, happy, pure-hearted girl with no title and not a princess."

Fei'er was stunned.

"Of course, I'm just saying."

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps forward and walked in front of Annie. "Princess, I should go. If you still remember that I saved you and protected you, please move away. I don't want to use these bloody claws to leave marks on you."

Annie's eyes overflowed with tears. She lowered her head and slowly made way.

Chu Xiaoye walked to the door and looked up at the locked door. He suddenly turned into an elf youth.

He reached out, tiptoed, and opened the door. Then, he turned to look at the elven girls in the room and said, "Before I leave, I'll let you admire my handsome body again. Don't miss me. I'll never see you again."

He walked out and became a lion again.

The journey was smooth and no one stopped them.

The night sky was dark and the moon and stars were hiding, but the Elf City was brightly lit.

The elves who had won the battle would pass this beautiful night excitedly. Of course, the beautiful girls who remembered him would definitely light candles in their rooms and pray for him with tears in their eyes.

"Goodbye, cute girls."

Chu Xiaoye walked out of the city gate and waved his claws at the Elf City. Then, he brought Catherine and strode away.

When he passed through the already cleared canyon and came to the edge of the cliff, he was dumbfounded as he looked at the empty two banks of the cliff and the bottomless abyss under his feet.

Where was the bridge?

When he returned to the elf city in frustration with Catherine and walked to the city gate, the Queen suddenly stood on the city wall with all the elven girls in the fairy city and shouted at him sweetly, "Lord Night, welcome home\! This is your home, we're your family\! Please love us\!"

Chu Xiaoye froze in place and looked at her in a daze.
