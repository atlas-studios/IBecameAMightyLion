Chapter 41: Companions

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out and slapped Little Curly Tail's head to make him let go.

It was not a good thing that this kid was too rash.

Why couldn't he be more mature and steady like him?

Little Curly Tail let go of his mouth, raised his claws and shook his head. He felt that his brother was more violent than him and would slap him at any time.

Those claws had once cut open a hyena's stomach\!

Lars hurriedly got up and ran to the side of the lioness with a broken tail. He looked at Little Curly Tail in shock and fear.

Was this bastard trying to bite him to death?

He was his big brother\!

Little Curly Tail looked at him disdainfully and lay down in front of the prey's abdomen, preparing to eat.

He remembered that his brother did not like to eat internal organs.

To his surprise, he had just laid down and had yet to move his mouth when Chu Xiaoye slapped him away. Then, he bit the gnu's neck and started dragging the entire gnu's body\!

Little Curly Tail was shocked.

Brother is so strong\!

However, was he going to swallow the prey alone in front of his mother and father?

The other lionesses were also shocked\!

This kid was even more overboard than his older brother, Lars\!

If he was already like this before he became an adult, what would happen when he became an adult\!

Aisha opened her mouth and prepared to reprimand him.

The lion stood up from the grass not far away. His gaze was cold as he decided to come and uphold justice\!

He wanted to teach this greedy kid who did not know the immensity of heaven and earth a lesson\!

But.

The next moment, they were all stunned.

Chu Xiaoye dragged the gnu in front of Xi'er, then stopped. He placed the softest abdomen of the prey by Xi'er's mouth, signaling her to eat.

Xi'er looked at him blankly, her remaining amber eye filled with complicated emotions.

He saved her life.

He was the one who saved her daughter's life.

Now, she was seriously injured and could not move, but he dragged the prey in front of her for her to enjoy.

This feeling, this kindness, made her a little confused and was a little unbelievable.

This was completely different from the companions she had seen for many years. It even exceeded her understanding.

Could a lion do these things?

"Roar\!"

Just as she was in a daze, Chu Xiaoye gestured to her again to eat quickly.

The lion, the cold father, looked at him deeply and lay down again.

Aisha and the other lionesses were shocked, but they did not think much of it. They walked over and continued to enjoy the prey.

Mei Mei walked to Chu Xiaoye's side and rubbed his head gently and affectionately.

Little Curly Tail was stunned. Then, he ran over and started eating from the prey's thigh.

He looked up at his brother as he ate.

His brother was indeed different. He was indeed his idol\!

Howeverâ€¦

Could his brother be more mature and steady? He should not hit his head so easily.

If he was not careful and slapped him to death like how he slapped a hyena last time, who would help him dominate the grassland in the future\!

He was his younger brother and his lackey who would help him dominate the grassland in the future. Oh, no, he was a good helper\!

Lars was frightened by Chu Xiaoye's strength\!

With his current size and strength, he could never drag this adult gnu\!

However, this brat had just lifted it as if it was light as a feather and easily moved this gnu\!

The terrifying scene of the kid lying on the ground riddled with wounds and surrounded by hyenas' corpses appeared in his mind again\!

This kid was even more terrifying than Little Curly Tail\!

While Lars was afraid, he also became secretly vigilant and worried.

Any pride only had one king\!

In the future, if their father grew old and the brothers wanted to snatch the throne, Little Curly Tail would definitely help this kid. As for him, he was a lone lion and was not a match for this kid. What should he do in the future?

Sigh, could it be that in the future, he could only bow down and assist this younger brother loyally?

He was unwilling to accept this.

He was the big brother after all. How could he be willing to bow down to a younger brother?

Then.

There was only one way\!

He had to please his father and make him chase the two brothers away. He had to let them stay away from the pride and this territory and wander\!

Lars thought as he ate the fresh meat. His gaze at Chu Xiaoye became colder.

He could not let go of the pride, territory, food and the throne\!

However.

The lion lying in the grass not far away, his father, was also looking at him with an icy gaze.

He, who was almost two years old, needed more and more food.

There was only so much prey. During the dry season, there would be even less prey.

The more he ate, the less the other lions would eat. The chances of them surviving the dry season would be even slimmer.

Furthermore, Callie was already pregnant.

Maya, who had lost Gigi, was also about to get pregnant.

Therefore, when he continued to eat his prey greedily, the lion, the cold father, looked at him with an increasingly cold and disgusted gaze.

The pride soon ate their fill.

Above him, the cries of vultures could be heard.

Two vultures circled in the sky, waiting for the pride to leave.

Not only did they eat rotten meat, but they also ate the leftovers of other carnivores.

They were the cleaners on the grassland and the guiding light for other carnivores to find food.

The gnu only had a skeleton, a head, and some flesh in gaps left.

After the lions finished eating, they walked to the side to rest.

The two vultures cried out and landed.

The other vultures were rushing over.

In the distance of the grassland, the jackals who had been watching their movements with their heads raised and the few wild dogs that had been chased away by their tribes immediately rushed over after hearing the news.

However, after seeing the pride, the jackal and a few wild dogs ran around anxiously, not daring to approach.

Only the vultures were fighting to share the last of the gnu's flesh.

Seeing that it was hopeless to steal food, the jackal turned around and started to chase after the few wild dogs.

The wild dogs fled.

The lion stood up and left with the pride.

This was his territory. Someone naturally had to clean the trash in his territory.

Vultures could eat the flesh on the gnu's bones.

Hungry wild dogs could use their sharp teeth to break the bones of gnus.

These animals were not a threat to his pride.

The hot sun roasted the lions until their mouths were dry.

The lion decided to bring the pride to the river to drink water.

Xi'er was seriously injured. Although she had rested for a while and could walk now, she walked very slowly and was in a lot of pain.

Mei Mei stayed obediently by her side.

The lion did not slow down.

The weak who could not keep up with the team would always be eliminated, regardless of how much they had contributed to the tribe in the past.

The four female lions followed closely behind the male lion, not daring to fall behind.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at Xi'er. Before he could move, Little Curly Tail, who was beside him, immediately understood what he meant. He lay on the ground and did not get up.
