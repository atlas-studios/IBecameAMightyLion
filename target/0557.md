Chapter 557: Human Town

The room was dark.

The scarlet smoke was like a growing devil that quickly occupied the entire room. Then, it quietly crawled into the noses of the three girls on the bed.

Outside the room.

The black-clothed man with the bamboo tube took out another bamboo tube from his chest. Then, he came to the room on the right and used the same trick.

In the room, Chu Xiaoye was exhausted and fell asleep.

Lanisi lay in his arms, curled up like a kitten. Her pink face was still flushed from the passion.

She had a smile on her face and was sleeping soundly.

Fei'er also fell asleep on the stool. She watched and listened from the beginning to the end and fell asleep in a daze.

However, Catherine did not sleep.

When the night people quietly approached the room, she opened her eyes.

When the scarlet smoke reached into the room silently like the claws of a demon, she suddenly jumped down from the stool. She rushed up the bed and slapped Chu Xiaoye's head.

Her dark eyes were filled with faint resentment.

Chu Xiaoye woke up. When he saw that it was her and was about to push her away to continue sleeping, he suddenly smelled an unfamiliar fragrance.

Although he had become an elf, his sense of smell was still as sensitive as a lion.

He could immediately distinguish any additional smell in the room.

He looked at the door of the room, his eyes flickering with golden light. He clearly saw the scarlet smoke floating in the air.

He suddenly sat up and covered Lanisi's mouth and nose.

Lanisi woke up with a start and looked at him with her eyes wide open. She thought that he would do it again. Just as she was about to pull herself together and continue to serve him, she suddenly felt the cold killing intent in his eyes.

Lanisi woke up completely and looked at the door.

In another room.

The door quietly opened from outside.

A few night humans held daggers and walked in with sacks.

The room was quiet and filled with scarlet smoke.

The three girls on the bed did not move.

"Success\! Quick, pack it up\!"

The rucksack of the few men in black quickly walked to the bed.

Right at this moment, a sword light suddenly flashed under the moonlight. With a whoosh, it pierced into the chest of a night person\!

Vilis sat up, but she swayed and was about to fall when she stabbed.

The night person she had stabbed fell to the ground.

The other black-clothed people were shocked. However, after seeing her situation, they immediately pounced forward.

"Whoosh\!"

Vilis swung her sword with all her might to stop the night people.

However, she no longer had the strength.

"Quick\! Take that away first\!"

A night person grabbed a girl's ankle and dragged her off the bed, quickly crawling into the sack.

Vilis wanted to shout for help and swing her sword to block, but she did not have the strength.

She held her sword and leaned against the corner, feeling sleepy.

She held her sword and leaned against the corner, feeling sleepy.

They had captured Doya.

Denise was unconscious and lay beside Vilis, protected by her sword.

"Bang\!"

Just as the door next door opened, the few night humans that rushed in flew out.

Chu Xiaoye, Lanisi, Fei'er, and Catherine rushed out.

Vilis wanted to shout, but she could not make a sound. She was anxious and fainted.

"I was discovered?" "Leave quickly\!"

The black-robed men quickly retreated.

Chu Xiaoye was about to chase when he suddenly realized that the door at the side was open. He immediately stopped in his tracks and rushed into the room.

"Vilis, are you okay?"

He looked at the unconscious girl on the bed, but he only saw two.

"Where's Doya?"

Lanisi also rushed in with an ugly expression.

"Lanisi, Fei'er, stay here and guard Vilis and Denise. Catherine and I will save Doya\!"

After Chu Xiaoye finished speaking, he jumped down from the window at the side with Catherine.

The men in black had already crossed the wall and fled.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye rushed to the wall and suddenly jumped over.

Catherine followed closely.

The night people were very fast and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

However, Chu Xiaoye could clearly smell the scent they left behind.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine followed the aura and suddenly came to a brightly lit alley.

The auras of the night people disappeared in the alley.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked at the luxurious three-story building in the alley. It was decorated with lanterns and colored banners and was filled with orioles.

Many gorgeously dressed daughters waved their handkerchiefs upstairs and called for passersby. There were also a few women with heavy makeup standing at the door.

This was a brothel\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He did not hesitate and immediately jumped in from the wall at the side.

Just as they landed, two huge wolfhounds pounced forward, barking crazily. However, in an instant, they suddenly stopped in their tracks and let out a wail. They turned around and fled with their tails between their legs.

Catherine jumped down beside him. The ferocious beast aura she emitted terrified the two wolfhounds.

"Who?"

Someone walked over from the round door.

Chu Xiaoye rushed over and suddenly swung his fist. He hit the man's temple with a bang and knocked him out.

Catherine passed him at lightning speed and ran in front.

The female cub was still a lion, and her sense of smell was naturally much more sensitive than his.

She smelled those people again.

Chu Xiaoye did not bring a sword, only a dagger at his waist.

He pulled out his dagger and followed behind Catherine, his eyes revealing cold killing intent.

"Who are you?"

Two guards with lanterns discovered him and walked over as they asked.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine pounced at one of the guards and cut open his throat, preventing him from even letting out a scream.

Chu Xiaoye also rushed in front of another guard and stabbed the dagger in his hand into his throat. After the other party fell, he slowly pulled it out.

Catherine walked under a window and jumped in.

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps back and jumped in.

For some reason, he felt that his current skills were much more agile than before, as if he was already approaching the lion's agile speed and jumping ability.

They entered the room.

The room was empty.

However, a clear voice came from the room beside him.

"What, twenty gold coins? What do you think you're selling? A princess inlaid with gold?"

"Aunty Hong, look carefully. This is an orc girl. She's only fourteen or fifteen years old at most. She's tender and might even be a virgin. Haven't you always wanted to find a few orc girls? The guests here are from all over the world. Your human women are not enough to serve them."

"At most fifteen\! If you're selling, stay. If not, take them away\! You abducted them. How do I know that their owners won't find them to cause trouble? I still have to take a huge risk\!"

"Aunty Hong, how about this? Let's each take a step back and make a one-time offer of 18 gold coins. How about that? I'm not afraid to tell you that there are still a few top-grade elves with good looks and figures there. At that time, I'll get them for you. I guarantee that the brothel will be full of customers every night and you'll make a lot of money\!"

"Hmph\! Elves? Would elves come to such a place? You're bluffing\! Fifteen gold coins, not more than one\! If you don't sell, take it away\!"

"Aunty Hong, you still don't believe me? There are really a few extremely good fairy girls. All of them are like fairies that have descended to the mortal world. You can ask Zhang Kui, he was the waiter there. He saw it with his own eyes."

"Yes, yes, yes\! Aunty Hong, I, Zhang Kui, swear that there are really a few elf girls living there. That beauty, I really can't describe it. She's definitely the most beautiful and sexy girl I've ever seen. Although they're all wearing headscarves, I can tell at a glance that their aura is really not fake."

"Alright, alright\! Stop bragging\! I'll give you an extra gold coin as a labor fee\! Get her out and take the sack away. You guys leave quickly too. Don't delay my business."

At this moment, Catherine finally smelled Doya.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye kicked open the door and suddenly pierced the dagger in his hand into the neck of a night person standing closest to the door\!

Before the night person could fall, he pounced at another black-clothed person.

Catherine also rushed in like lightning. With a silver flash, she cut open the stomach of a man in black who was about to escape\!

"Ah\!" "Save me\!" "Save me\!"

There were five black-clothed people, a waiter, and a woman in a big red dress with heavy makeup.

The woman was shocked. As she screamed, she ran towards the window.

Chu Xiaoye rushed up and grabbed her hair. He cut her neck with the dagger and threw her to the ground.

At this moment, there were still two black-clothed men and the attendant left.

Catherine had already pounced at the second black-clothed man. Before the black-clothed man could raise his dagger, she slashed his throat\!

The waiter shrank his body and fled along the corner. Just as he was about to run out of the door, Chu Xiaoye kicked the stool away. With a bang, he smashed him to the ground. Then, he rushed over and stabbed him in the neck. Then, he suddenly used his strength and actually cut his head off.

The remaining black-clothed man was terrified. He jumped suddenly and wanted to fly out the window.

However, Catherine was even faster. Before he could land outside, his stomach was already cut open by a silver light.

All of this happened in a flash. Before the people in the room could react, they had already fallen into a pool of blood.

When the noisy footsteps on the stairs outside and the roar of anger came from outside, Chu Xiaoye had already picked up the unconscious Doya and jumped out the window with Catherine.

"Thief\! Where do you think you're going\!"

Unexpectedly, two more guards suddenly appeared below.

When the two guards heard the noise, they quickly ran over and happened to see them jump down. They immediately pulled out the knives at their waists and roared as they rushed up.

However, they only lasted for three seconds before they fell to the ground.

Catherine brought up the rear while Chu Xiaoye carried Doya in front and followed. They ran the way they came and soon arrived at the wall of the yard.

Chu Xiaoye ran a few steps and suddenly jumped up. He suddenly jumped seven to eight meters high and jumped out.

As soon as he landed, Catherine followed him.

More footsteps suddenly came from the street.

Chu Xiaoye immediately hugged Doya and ran in another direction. Soon, he ran out of this well-lit alley and disappeared into the dark night.

When he carried Doya and was about to run back to the inn, he suddenly realized that the outside of the inn was already surrounded by human soldiers.

A murder and kidnapping happened in the store. In his fear, the boss immediately sent someone to report to the authorities. Coincidentally, a patrol team was nearby and immediately rushed over.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the soldiers holding torches with a dark expression.

One did not need to think to know that these soldiers were definitely in cahoots with that brothel and might even have benefits. Otherwise, that brothel would not be able to open so big, let alone blatantly sell people.

He had just killed so many people in the brothel and the owner of the brothel. The news would probably arrive soon.

At that time, these soldiers would immediately be vigilant. Lanisi and the others would probably never be able to escape.

"Catherine, watch Doya here. I'll be back soon."

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate anymore. He placed Doya in a dark corner and let Catherine watch. He immediately strode towards the inn.

He had to bring Lanisi and the others out before these soldiers received the news.
