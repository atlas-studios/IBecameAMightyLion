Chapter 272: The True King

The black pride that had just rushed over and had yet to stop immediately suffered a head-on attack and their formation was instantly in chaos\!

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Tilly and charged through the black pride like an unstoppable sword, slaughtering them back and forth\!

Little Curly Tail followed behind. His long tail was like a whip as he swung it crazily and stuck to the ground\!

The black lions fell to the ground one by one. Before they could stand up, their spines were cut open by Mei Mei, Mixed Fur, and the other lions following behind. Their throats were bitten off\!

Blood splashed and limbs flew\!

The aggressive black pride panicked and fled in panic in the blink of an eye.

"Roar\!"  

An angry roar suddenly sounded from behind the black pride\!

The hearts of the black lions trembled. They immediately stabilized their minds and gathered, preparing to counterattack\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly brought Catherine and Tilly through the middle of the black pride and rushed towards the black lion leader standing at the back surrounded by a few lions\!

The black lions that were about to stabilize their formation were in chaos again. They surrounded the three young lions.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei brought the pride of the cold father and the six lions to attack from behind, protecting them tightly.

More than four hundred lions, female lions, and young cubs also roared as they followed behind and charged forward bravely\!

This vast army and thunderous roars, as well as the ferocious aura of being united against a common enemy, immediately frightened the hundred-over black lions\!

When Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Tilly and rushed towards the black lion leader with an unstoppable aura, the surrounding black lions immediately turned around and ran with them.

They seemed to want to stop him, but also seemed to be frightened by the pride behind them.

This way, the black lion leader would not only face this ferocious pride army, but also his more than 100 companions\!

"Roar\!"

He roared continuously, wanting to stabilize his pride and make them turn around to attack, but it was useless.

The suppression of numbers and aura, as well as the lightning massacre at the beginning, scared them out of their wits. They were terrified and flustered and could not stop at all.

Some brave black lions, even if they wanted to stop and turn around to attack, were swept away by the torrent of their companions' running. If they hesitated for a moment, they would be knocked to the ground and trampled to death\!

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly flashed in front of the black lion leader\!

The few lions protecting him instantly split their heads and fell into a pool of blood\!

The black lion leader's heart turned cold. He no longer had any fighting spirit and turned to flee at his fastest speed.

His escape completely sounded the death knell of this black pride.

The black lions that still wanted to gather beside him and counterattack with the dignity of his leader completely gave up on resisting and immediately followed him, fleeing in panic.

They won by a landslide\!

The atmosphere of panic and escape instantly enveloped the entire black pride.

They came aggressively and fought to escape.

Chu Xiaoye brought the army with a magnificent aura and chased after them. His roar shook the sky\!

These once majestic and murderous black lions were now like stray dogs. Other than fleeing in a sorry state, they had no other choice.

Many black lions were knocked to the ground by their companions and could not stand up again.

Many black lions left the team and ran in different directions.

More black lions died under the fangs of these prides that had once been covered in their darkness\!

Under Chu Xiaoye's lead, the pride behind him became braver and more ferocious the more they chased. Their previous fear and despair had long turned to nothingness. Now, their blood was surging and their auras pierced the sky\!

Even the female lions and young cubs pounced ferociously and fearlessly on the fallen black lions. They bit crazily and enjoyed themselves\!

One side fled in fear, and the other chased bravely.

In the blink of an eye, only a few of the hundred-plus black lions that had come aggressively followed the black lion leader and fled into the distant darkness.

Chu Xiaoye did not chase after them anymore. Instead, he brought the pride and slaughtered all the black lions that were lying on the ground and could not get up on the road. He did not leave a single one alive\!

Blood splashed and miserable cries sounded endlessly.

In the past, these black devils had killed their families, snatched their homes, and brought them endless darkness and fear. Now, they would use the blood and lives of these black devils to offer sacrifices\!

At this moment, they no longer had fear or weakness. They only had courage and hatred, courage and anger\!

They had won\!

The hundred-over black devils were actually unable to withstand a single blow. Before they could fight, they had already fled in disarray, looking even more miserable and terrified than when they fled back then.

It turned out that these terrifying black devils were not invincible\!

It turned out that they, these homeless wandering lions, were not so unbearable and useless.

They could defeat the other party\!

They had a chance to take revenge for their families\!

They also had hope to reclaim their homes\!

As long as they were united\!

As long as they followed this young and brave king\!

Everything was possible\!

"Roar\!"

Their roars resounded through the night sky and spread throughout the entire grassland\!

On the horizon, the darkness retreated and dawn appeared\!

The prides that had been chasing all the way did not feel tired at all. They were excited, as if they understood the meaning of life for the first time. They understood the importance of a team for the first time, and it was also as if they knew a true king for the first time\!

This king was the true king all their members willingly submitted to\!

Only such a king had hope of leading them to kill the enemy and reclaim their home\!

At this moment, all the lions and all the members looked at the young figure with respect and excitement.

The unwillingness and frustration in the depths of the one-eyed lion king's heart had long disappeared the moment this young lion king led the charge.

Looking at the pride of more than four hundred members, their gazes of admiration and trust, and their courage and confidence, he knew that this young lion king was what everyone wanted\!

He was their hope\!

The morning sun gradually rose in the distance.

The golden flag fluttered under the golden morning sun and in their hearts, giving them the courage and strength to return to their homes and continue to survive.

Tomorrow would be better.

But today, he had to work hard.

Under the lead of this young king, they would continue to work hard and move forward bravely\!

The distant grassland was still covered in darkness.

There were still many lions that had lost their homes and were wandering over from all directions.

And here, a new home would appear. They would gather and work together. Under the lead of this young lion king, they would use their fangs and sharp teeth to return to their homeland bravely and unyieldingly\!
