Chapter 16: Brother Is Amazing

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Under the tree, the baboon army roared as they charged forward\!

They were like a dense and murderous human army that was charging forward with murderous intent\!

The five female lions brought the five young cubs and fled towards the grassland in panic.

The Chu Xiaoye trio hid on the tree and watched the terrifying scene, not daring to move.

Soon.

The baboon army charged away, leaving behind a mess of bushes and grass.

Little Curly Tail growled to show that he was not afraid at all.

Chu Xiaoye could not stop him in time and heard a baboon's ear-piercing roar coming from under the tree\!

It turned out that there was still an old baboon that could not keep up with the main group. It fell behind and walked slowly.

In the end, just as he walked out of the bushes, he heard Little Curly Tail roar from the tree.

The old baboon looked up and saw that there were still three cubs hiding on the tree. He was overjoyed\!

Although he was already old and did not have the strength and agility of those young baboons, it was still easy to deal with such young cubs.

Furthermore, the three little cubs were not hiding elsewhere, but on a tree\!

Looking at the three little cubs' young and tender bodies, the old baboon almost drooled.

This kind of young cub must be crunchy when chewed\!

He let out an excited roar and climbed up the tree without hesitation. He used his limbs and quickly climbed up the branch\!

Mei Mei was trembling in fear.

Chu Xiaoye let out a roar and immediately brought her and Little Curly Tail to climb towards the highest canopy.

The branches there were thin, soft, and able to withstand their weight. Moreover, there was also a branch that could be defended.

With the old baboon's weight, he definitely did not dare to go up.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei followed behind him. They climbed very quickly and soon reached the highest canopy.

Chu Xiaoye let them lie on the two soft branches while he turned around and climbed down. He looked down and guarded the second branch that led to the canopy. His gaze was fixed on the old baboon that was quickly climbing up.

This place was about seven to eight meters above the ground. Regardless of whether it was the three young cubs or the old baboon, if they fell from here, they would be crippled even if they did not die.

Therefore, at this moment, he tensed up and his muscles bulged. He decided to guard this branch to the death\!

The old baboon quickly climbed up, raised its head, and bared its fangs at him. It let out a threatening roar, as if it wanted to scare him into panicking and make him fall to his death.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it coldly, unmoved.

The old baboon was furious when it saw that the cub was so bold. It raised its sharp claws and grabbed at him\!

Chu Xiaoye stayed on the branch. With nowhere to hide, he could only raise his claws and use all his strength to slap it\!

"Impudent little thing\!"

The old baboon's eyes were filled with disdain.

This little cub was laughably childish. He actually wanted to rely on his small body to fight him\!

He was courting death\!

"Bang\!"

The big and small claws collided heavily\!

The old baboon suddenly swayed and tilted its head, almost falling off the tree trunk\!

At the same time, he felt a sharp pain and numbness on his palm and arm\!

The strength of this little cub was actually so terrifying\!

The old baboon was shocked\!

Before he could react, Chu Xiaoye suddenly spat at him and sprayed his saliva all over his face\!

Chu Xiaoye's limbs were also numb, and his small body was almost sent flying\!

The old baboon was shocked and furious. It immediately wrapped its arms around the tree trunk and used all its strength to shake it\!

The thin and weak branches on the top of the tree immediately shook violently\!

Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail, who were lying at the highest point, were like small boats on a huge wave. They swayed with the branches and were terrified, almost falling from the shaking\!

Chu Xiaoye also did not have it easy. He was immediately dizzy from the shaking and swayed left and right, almost losing his balance\!

The old baboon was overjoyed to see the effect of his move. It continued to hug the tree trunk and shake it vigorously, letting out a pleased and excited roar.

Seeing that Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail were about to lose control, Chu Xiaoye immediately made up his mind. He roared suddenly and jumped down from the branch, sitting on the old baboon's head\!

"Pfft—"

At this critical moment, he suddenly let out a super loud fart\!

Black smoke came out from his butt and instantly wrapped around the old baboon's head\!

A strong stench instantly filled the entire tree\!

"Ouch\! Ugh—"

The old baboon suddenly roared. Just as it was about to use its claws to scratch his butt, its stomach suddenly churned. Its legs went limp and it slid down the tree trunk\!

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to raise his claws and slap its neck\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Three times in a row\!

He used all his strength in every move\!

The sound of bones breaking suddenly came from the old baboon's neck\!

It could not hold on any longer. Its limbs turned limp and it fell completely from the tree trunk\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, he quickly extended his two claws while falling and grabbed a nearby branch, hanging there narrowly.

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The old baboon fell to the ground, lowered its head, and twitched a few times before never moving again.

He did not know if he was dead or if he fainted from the fall.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to be careless. He quickly climbed up the tree branch, then climbed down the tree quickly.

After landing, he ran to the old baboon's side and bit its neck. Two rows of small and sharp teeth were tightly stuck in its throat\!

Ten minutes later, he let go.

Seeing that the old baboon was deader than dead, he finally heaved a sigh of relief.

At this moment, he felt his entire body ache and become powerless. His limbs felt like jelly, and he was trembling endlessly with lingering fear\!

If he was even slightly careless when jumping down just now, he would have lost his life.

Fortunately, his actions were agile enough, he was powerful enough and his fart was smelly enough.

Of course, it was also fortunate that this baboon was old enough and its reactions were a little slow. Its strength had also reached a weak state.

God protect me.

He was terrified and did not dare to stay on the ground for long. He immediately pulled himself together and climbed back up the tree.

On the canopy.

Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail were still obediently lying on the two branches and looking at him in a daze, shocked and in disbelief.

Of course, he was more grateful and happy after surviving a calamity.

When the two little cubs saw him climb up the tree, they immediately climbed down from the canopy carefully and climbed to his position. They rubbed and licked him, showing sufficient intimacy and fawning.

They seemed to be saying: Brother is really impressive\!

Chu Xiaoye panted as he waved his claws and opened their mouths, looking at the distant grassland.

He wondered how the lionesses and the cubs were doing.

The furious baboon army would not let the matter rest so easily.

He only hoped that his mother was well and that the other lionesses and his siblings were unharmed like them.

"Ugh\!"

Mei Mei, who was standing behind him, suddenly vomited.

The little lioness was rejected by him when she tried to lick his head. Seeing that he was looking into the distance, she prepared to lick his butt secretly to show her affection. In the end, before the stench of farts could dissipate, she vomited from the stench.

Little Curly Tail, who was at the side, immediately swung his tail in schadenfreude and retreated far away.
