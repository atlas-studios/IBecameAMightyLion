Chapter 434: Untitled

"Roar—"

Right at this critical moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared and attracted the attention of the python hiding behind the water curtain.

Then, as he roared at the big black bear, he swam over aggressively, as if he wanted to fight.

In that instant just now, Chu Xiaoye calculated that he was too far away from the little girl and was going against the water. No matter how fast he was, he could not be faster than the python. He could not alert the enemy in his panic.

He pretended that he did not notice the python and quickly swam to the big black bear's side. He extended his claws and slapped it rudely.

After lashing out a few times, he retreated towards the little girl and continued to roar provocatively at the big black bear.

Indeed, the python was hiding behind the water curtain. It was attracted by the commotion here and stopped there motionless, not continuing forward.

Chu Xiaoye took the opportunity to quickly swim to the little girl's side. He secretly flicked his golden claws in the water and waited solemnly.

The big black bear was clearly a little stunned after being slapped a few times. It stood there timidly looking at him with a confused and uneasy expression, not daring to come and take revenge.

The other members of the pride also looked over in confusion, not knowing what was happening.

The little girl hurriedly hugged her chest and sank into the water. Even her chin was submerged in the water. Her two big eyes stared at him with an angry expression. She did not know that she had already walked through the gates of hell just now.

Chu Xiaoye held his breath and quietly pushed her with his claws underwater, signaling her to go ashore quickly.

The little girl was frightened by his claws and took another step back towards the water curtain at the back.

"Idiot\!"

Chu Xiaoye was anxious and angry. A green light flashed in his eyes and he could only pretend to be very casual. He looked at the water curtain behind her and saw that the python hiding behind the water curtain had already disappeared at some point.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before looking down at the water. He was shocked. Could it be that the python had already dived into the water?

At this moment, he could not hesitate\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly rushed in front of the little girl and hugged her with his two front claws. A stream of air spewed out from behind him and he quickly ran towards the shore\!

The little girl screamed in fear and the clean gazelle skin in her arms fell into the water.

Fortunately, Chu Xiaoye brought her ashore safely. The python that was hiding somewhere did not appear.

However, the little girl that he had forcefully dragged ashore ran anxiously to the water's edge and prepared to go into the water to scoop up the gazelle skin. She shouted, "My skin\! My skin\!"

That was a leather coat Chu Xiaoye made for her personally. It was very warm and cute when worn.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not have any protective feelings for the fairer sex. He slapped her waist and sent her flying back. She landed three meters away and fell to the ground in a sorry state.

"Roarâ€”"

When the big black bear in the water saw this scene, it immediately bared its fangs and roared at Chu Xiaoye fiercely.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at it. He looked down at the deep pool and immediately roared at the pride downstream, ordering them to get up from the water immediately\!

Although the members of the pride did not know what was happening, they would never doubt or object to his decision and orders. They ran ashore from the water, and even the cute violent bears were no exception.

Only the big black bear closest to the pool did not listen to his orders. Instead, with a splash, it jumped into the pool and plunged into the water.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly walked to the side of the pool. Just as he was hesitating, water splashed everywhere. The big black bear popped its head out and wrapped its claws around the gazelle skin that had already sunk into the water. It even raised it proudly and swayed at the little girl with a fawning expression, as if it was asking for credit.

The little girl was in no mood to care about him. Seeing that so many lions were surrounding her, she hurriedly got up from the ground, squatted on the ground, and moved to the dress on the ground step by step. She quickly put on the bra inside the dress and the dress. At this moment, she heaved a sigh of relief.

Her face was red as she straightened her chest, placed her hands on her small waist, and pouted at Chu Xiaoye. "Bad king\! Youâ€¦"

Before she could finish speaking, Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared at the big black bear in the pool and told it to come up quickly.

The big black bear glanced at him unhappily. It raised the little girl's gazelle skin and started to swim towards the shore.

Right at this moment, a huge black shadow suddenly floated up from the pool in front of it\!

The big black bear trembled and bulged its eyes. It froze in fear and opened its mouth. However, the gazelle skin on its claws was still tightly grabbed and did not fall.

The members of the pride were all frightened by the huge black shadow that was slowly rising from the pool.

The black shadow quickly moved in the pool and stuck to the big black bear, wrapping around its tall and fat body.

The big black bear was trembling in fear, but it raised the gazelle skin and stood there, not daring to move.

The members of the pride on the shore retreated as if they were facing a great enemy, not daring to approach the pool.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the pool, his eyes flickering with a green light. He stared at the black shadow in the water for a moment before roaring at the big black bear again, telling it to come up quickly\!

The waterfall flowed and the water churned. The black shadow finally floated out of the water and revealed its true appearance\!

It was actually a black and thick snake skin\!

Under the impact of the water, the snake skin moved in the water like a python. It was stopped by the big black bear's body, as if it had taken the initiative to wrap around it.

The big black bear lowered its head and widened its eyes. It finally saw clearly what had almost frightened it to death. Its courage immediately increased as it pried open the snake skin with its claws. It let out a roar, opened its mouth, and actually laughed.

When the other members of the pride saw this scene, they immediately heaved a sigh of relief and relaxed.

It was just a snake skin\!

Under the impact of the water, the snake skin sank into the water again and quickly drifted downstream.

The big black bear did not dare to stay in the water for long. It immediately ran ashore and handed the wet gazelle skin on its claws to the little girl with a fawning expression.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the pool and looked behind the water curtain again, his expression still grave.

He was sure that he had not seen wrongly. The black shadow hiding behind the water curtain was definitely not just a snake skin, but a huge python\!

He could not stay here for long\!

He slowly took a few steps back, growled, turned around, and immediately left with the pride.

Not long after they left, two scarlet and deep vertical eyes suddenly lit up behind the water curtain. Like two ghost flames, they slowly passed through the water curtain and drifted out.

A huge and ferocious snake head with a tumor suddenly appeared\!
