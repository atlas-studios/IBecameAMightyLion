Chapter 479: Battle to the End

"Bang\!"

The sky had just lit up when the fierce slap above them sounded again\!

On the second hole, soil fell and the few cracks started to expand quickly.

The hole was about to collapse\!

The cute violent bear mother and son and the Jerry brothers could only retreat to avoid being hit by the collapsed soil and being buried alive.

"Boom\!"

Finally, under the continuous slap of the saber-toothed tiger's huge iron claws, the ceiling finally collapsed\!

Some light immediately shone into the dark cave.

The space to enter and exit the second hole was even larger, almost twice as big as before.

However, a thick and curved root grew at the collapsed place, splitting the space into two. In addition, the previous hole was filled with mud. The huge saber-toothed tiger could not enter for a moment.

Of course, with its cunning, it would never be the first to rush in without knowing the exact situation in the cave.

The pride gathered outside could not wait.

When the hole collapsed, they had already gathered outside the second cave with a roar.

After the saber-toothed tiger finished expanding the hole, it turned around and left, letting them play.

Five strong lions immediately rushed in from the hole, showing their sharp fangs and ferocious faces\!

More lions followed behind\!

"Roar—"

The Jerry brothers pounced forward first.

The cute violent bear and her son followed closely\!

The cold father also brought the three female lions and roared as he pounced forward to support them.

Mei Mei and Molly also rushed over.

They had to guard this entrance. Otherwise, today would be the day their pride was destroyed\!

The five lions that rushed in first were immediately pressed to the ground and bitten. However, behind them and above them, another five strong lions roared and rushed in.

The Jerry brothers bit two to death and immediately pounced at the five again.

However, more lions entered from the space above and jumped down, attacking one after another\!

The Belita sisters rushed over to support them. The three warthogs hiding in the cave also roared and rushed out, using their sharp fangs to pierce the bodies of the lions\!

His roar was like thunder and blood splashed\!

The ground was soon filled with corpses\!

"Bang\!"

An even larger lion king rushed in and slapped the little cute bear's head.

The cute violent bear covered in wounds immediately had its head caved in and its brain juice splashed out.

However, it did not die immediately. With a roar, it bit the lion king's front leg and its sharp teeth were embedded into the lion king's flesh and bones\!

The lion king was furious. It suddenly opened its bloody mouth and bit through its skull with a puff\!

However, the cute violent bear that had already died tragically seemed to have its sharp teeth nailed into its bones and still did not move\!

"Roar—"

The cute violent bear mother let out a miserable roar and suddenly bit its neck\!

The lion king fell to the ground and struggled with all its might, but its thigh and neck were tightly bitten by the cute mother and son pair. It could not stand up no matter what.

The other lions hurriedly rushed over to save him\!

The two lions opened their bloody mouths and threw the cute violent bear mother to the ground, biting her neck and stomach\!

"Whoosh\!"

The cute violent bear mother's stomach was torn open and blood and internal organs flowed out.

Her neck was also bitten off.

However, she still bit the lion king's neck tightly until her eyes were wide open. She died completely and did not let go.

She died with her children.

As for the powerful lion king, it completely stopped breathing under this crazy and tragic bite.

The bloody battle continued.

The other two holes suddenly charged.

Little Curly Tail, Mixed Fur, and Blue guarded the entrance of the cave tightly and did not take a step back.

Alisa rushed to the second hole and suddenly killed the lion that had bitten through the cold father's head with one claw. She then pounced at another lion king.

However, more and more lions jumped down from above.

Their eyes were red from killing and they could not tell friend from foe.

"Tibbs\! Go and help\! Block the entrance\!"

Right at this moment, the human girl suddenly spoke from the tree hole above them.

The big black bear, who was standing in the middle of the cave, trembling and at a loss, suddenly roared angrily and rushed towards the second hole\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

It swung its huge claws and slapped away three lions in succession\!

Then, it grabbed the lion king's corpse and stood up. It used it as a weapon and quickly swung it above its head\!

The strong lion king's corpse was swung like a crazily spinning propeller. When the lions outside the cave jumped in from the hole above, before they could land, they were minced into pieces and flesh splashed everywhere\!

The big black bear's roar was like thunder. He was like a peerless demon god that could support the heavens and the earth. He swung his divine weapon and blocked the hole above him with his own strength\!

The Jerry brothers, who were covered in wounds and the cold father whose skull was bitten through, ignored the danger behind them and immediately pounced forward to use their bodies to block the entrance at the front.

Hence, the ten-over lions became turtles in a jar\!

Alisa, Mei Mei, Molly, the Belita sisters, the blind Xi'er, and the others started to kill with their bloody wounds\!

Soon, the ten-over lions fell to the ground and became corpses.

"Roar—"

A few roars suddenly came from outside the cave.

The ferocious attack suddenly stopped.

The three holes immediately stopped moving.

The big black bear still raised the lion king's broken corpse and swung it crazily. It let out a fierce and terrifying roar, as if it was not tired.

The space above him was still bright, but no lion dared to jump down after courting death.

They finally defended this attack.

The four prides outside suffered heavy casualties and the two lion kings died in this attack.

They could not charge anymore and had to stop. Otherwise, the entire pride would be destroyed.

This was not the outcome they wanted or the plan they had formulated.

They regretted it a little.

Originally, they only needed to wait patiently outside and could use hunger and fear to defeat this pride in the cave. They would not have suffered such heavy casualties originally.

They turned around and wanted to find the figure of the culprit, the saber-toothed tiger, but they realized that the other party was gone again.

Of course, even if the other party was here, they did not dare to do anything.

They decided that they would never be rash again. They had to wait patiently until the pride in the cave starved to death\!

The big black bear stopped waving the corpse and stood there covered in blood with a blank expression.

His iron tower-like body seemed to have become taller and more ferocious than before.

It raised its head and looked at the tree hole.

The little girl still did not appear.

Catherine still guarded the entrance of the cave and did not move. Everything outside seemed to have nothing to do with her. She would not look at anyone who died.

Her gaze would always be here.

Above him, the python-like black shadow appeared again.

The fragrance in the tree hole turned into a cloud that was difficult to see with the naked eye. Like a light barrier, it enveloped the little girl and the young lion that was still sleeping.

The little girl widened her eyes, seemingly understanding. Her golden hair fell behind her and fluttered without the wind. Her snow-white dress was spotless in this cave full of dust.

Her delicate skin suddenly lit up with a milky-white halo, causing her young face to instantly look so holy and solemn.

The giant tree trembled and the fire phoenix cried out\!

The python-like black shadow had just climbed down and had yet to reach the root when it suddenly froze and turned to ashes.
