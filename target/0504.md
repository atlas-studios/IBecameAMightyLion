Chapter 504: The Orcs Attack

Chu Xiaoye won again.

However, this time, the Queen did not let him go immediately.

"Your Majesty, you should keep your promise. Your subordinates and subjects are all looking at you."

Chu Xiaoye did not want to make things too stiff.

After all, this was not a vast grassland and he could not run freely.

"Of course I'll keep my promise."

The Queen endured the churning in her stomach and said with certainty, "Lanisi never goes back on her word."

"Thenâ€¦"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the iron door that was still closed in front of him.

Lanisi pretended to be confused and was still conflicted about that fart. She said, "This isn't a scheme. It's shameless."

Chu Xiaoye laughed. "Do schemes still need to be determined by shamelessness? Your Majesty, now, I might understand why your elves will always be defeated in the battle with the orcs and are about to be exterminated."

"Clang\!"

Vilis pulled out the sword on her shoulder. Her face was pale and she was clearly very angry.

"Lady Vilis, you're angry from embarrassment."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her without any fear.

The Queen was standing in front of him. At such a close distance, he did not believe that the elven loli's huge sword would be faster than his claws.

"I'm angry from embarrassment. What about it?"

Vilis lost the coldness and composure that she had always maintained hypocritically. She was like a kitten that had its tail stepped on and was furious.

She had always been furious that the elves had fallen to such a miserable state. At this moment, a lion had mentioned it in front of the queen and her, and even said that it would exterminate the entire race. Could she not be sad and angry?

"Then continue."

Chu Xiaoye said calmly, not caring about her feelings at all, nor did he care about his words. Would he completely anger this little elf with an orgasm in swordsmanship?

Vilis gripped the hilt of her sword with both hands, trembling with anger. Tears welled in her eyes.

However, it was difficult for her to maintain her last bit of rationality.

"We will never be exterminated\!"

She said hatefully.

This time, Chu Xiaoye remained silent.

It was a little exciting, so it was better to stop when necessary.

While he was bickering with Vilis, Queen Lanisi had been staring at him. Her eyes reflected the jumping flames and flickered with a moving light.

"Night, then, are you willing to join us?"

Not only was the Queen not angry at his rude words, she suddenly invited him to join.

Vilis quietened down and looked at him with tears in her eyes.

Annie also seemed to be looking forward to it.

Denise still looked calm, like a lake that had never experienced a storm and was always so clear and beautiful.

"Of course not."

Chu Xiaoye almost did not pretend to think before rejecting her. "I don't want to die."

Vilis said angrily, "You're an elf too\! You have the responsibility to stay here and help us\!"

Chu Xiaoye wagged his tail and said, "Look, I'm a lion. I've always been a lion. Even if I become an elf, my heart will always be with the grassland, not here. Do you understand?"

"You yearn for freedom, right?"

Lanisi said softly.

Chu Xiaoye smiled and said, "Who doesn't yearn for freedom?"

Lanisi nodded and looked at him with bright eyes. "If you're willing to stay, I can give you the greatest freedom. If you can help us, I can give you the most glorious reward of the elves. No matter what you want, I'll find a way to satisfy you."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He also looked at her with bright eyes and whispered, "Your Majesty, I want to live."

Lanisi fell silent.

Indeed, the chances of survival were not high if he stayed here.

She had a big heart and dignity that could not be blasphemed. She would not break her promise because of this lion's rejection.

She did not force it anymore. She raised her head and said to the guards above, "Open the iron door and inform the guards outside to let them leave."

"Yes, Your Majesty\!"

The heavy iron door slowly rose.

Chu Xiaoye thanked the Queen and left with Catherine.

Annie wanted to chase after him, but she was stopped by Vilis.

The Queen also said softly, "Annie, you belong here."

Chu Xiaoye also turned around and looked at her. "Don't follow. If not, I will eat you when I'm hungry."

Annie cried.

The big black bear, Tibbs, stood behind her and also cried.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine past the iron gate. Just as he was about to stride away, an elf knight suddenly rode over from outside and reported loudly, "Your Majesty\! The orc army has broken through the snow forest and is approaching the cliff\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped in his tracks and asked anxiously, "Can we still go out?"

The elf knight looked at him as if he was an idiot and ran away from him.

The only way out was to connect to the ice bridge on both sides of the cliff. The current ice bridge had probably been put away long ago.

If he wanted to go out, he could only fly.

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and immediately turned around with Catherine. He strode towards the Queen and said, "Your Majesty, do your promises just now still count?"

Lanisi was stunned for a moment before she nodded. "Of course."

"Then\!"

Chu Xiaoye was impassioned. "As an elf, it's my duty to protect my home\!"

Catherine quietly lowered her head, feeling that she was embarrassing herself.

"Then."

The Queen came in front of him and looked at him with a burning gaze. "From today onwards, Night, you are a strategist of my Elf Kingdom. Follow me and use your schemes to help us\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not help but say, "Can you change the word schemes to intelligence?"

Lanisi did not talk nonsense with him anymore. She raised her head and looked at the flustered elven nobles on the stands. She said loudly, "The orc army has already passed through the snow forest and reached the cliff\! If they cross the ice bridge, our entire Elven Kingdom will no longer exist\! And our citizens, our family, and our friends will also be slaughtered. We might even be abducted by those cruel orcs to be slaves, living a life worse than death\! For our home, for glory, for every member of our elven race, please pick up the weapons in your hands and follow your queen out to fight\! Kill all the orcs\!"

In the stands, the elven nobles pulled out their swords, and the guards raised their weapons. They shouted in unison and rushed down.

"Kill all the orcs\! Kill all the orcs\!"

The remaining thousand plus people in the entire Elf Kingdom started to move.

Be it men, women, old, or young, they picked up their weapons and followed their queen out of the strong city gate and rushed to the ice bridge.

This trip might bury them in the valley forever, but they had no choice\!

The fiery red pterodactyls cried in the sky. On the other side of the cliff, the orc army gathered and roared angrily like thunder.

The ice bridge that connected the two sides of the cliff had already been cut from the middle by the elf guards. However, the orc army was repairing the thick tree trunks that were cut from the snow forest.

In the sky, a few orcs were riding pterodactyls and looking down at them.

Lanisi's red-winged pterodactyl looked at them covetously from the other side.

Three more pterodactyls flew into the sky from the Elven City.

The orcs would not attack from the sky, because that was not their forte. They were strong, but only on the ground. Furthermore, their army did not have many winged dragons.

No one knew who killed the only firebreathing pterodactyl.

They were not anxious. The ones who were anxious should be the elves opposite them.

They had sealed the other party's only way out. They only needed to slowly repair the bridge and let the pitiful elves wait for death in fear and despair.
