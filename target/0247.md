Chapter 247: Going Home

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and finally returned to the territory.

The sisters were exercising their rights as lions and patrolling the borders of the territory.

When they saw such a team walking towards their territory from afar, they immediately roared angrily and let out threatening warnings.

The Chino brothers, who were sleeping in the bushes, immediately got up and roared as they rushed out when they heard the noise.

When the group of "invaders" gradually approached, they were still baring their fangs, showing their most ferocious expressions, and letting out the most terrifying roars.

Chu Xiaoye could clearly see the Chino brothers' four legs trembling.

Obviously, this pair of brothers almost peed their pants from the aura of their team.

However, from the reactions of the Chino brothers and the sisters, it could be seen that he had also changed a lot. Otherwise, they would not have failed to recognize him.

At this moment, another roar came from afar.

Then, the tall blue-eyed lion king rushed over aggressively with a group of lions and female lions to support the Chino brothers.

The Chino brothers' roars immediately became even louder.

Chu Xiaoye slapped Tilly away and walked in front with Catherine.

The blue-eyed lion king was stunned for a moment and immediately froze in place.

The roars of the Chino brothers and the Jiela sisters instantly stopped.

They finally recognized him.

"Roar—"

The Chino brothers immediately ran over and surrounded Chu Xiaoye and Catherine excitedly. As they circled, they wagged their tails vigorously and roared excitedly.

The Jiela sisters also ran over and lowered their heads respectfully.

The blue-eyed lion king walked over with the pride. He looked at the mixed fur lion king of the same size as him and then at the stronger Jerry brothers. He stood silently at the side, but his heart was not calm.

This young king was finally going to start fighting for supremacy on the grassland.

He had waited for this day for a long time\!

Chu Xiaoye brought the team back to the bushes and let them familiarize themselves with the environment here.

In another area of the grassland, there was also a territory belonging to the mixed fur lion king. His pride and children were still there.

However, from today onwards, this was his home.

The surrounding territory was theirs\!

The mixed fur lion king instructed his three subordinates to bring the pride over.

The Jiela sisters gathered with Lina and rubbed their fur to improve their relationship.

The Chino brothers lowered their tails and went in front of the Jerry brothers in a fawning manner to apologize for their rashness just now.

The mixed fur lion king and the blue-eyed lion king looked at each other and took the initiative to approach. They rubbed their bodies to show their friendliness.

Blue returned to the bushes and saw his wife and two daughters.

When Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes, Belita immediately jumped onto the tree and roared with a look of disdain, as if she was saying, "The big smelly fart is back\! Mom, run\!"

The female leopard and Blue were intimate and did not have the time to care about her.

Her sister, Belia, took the initiative to approach Chu Xiaoye and started flirting again.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him.

The two tall warthogs crawled into the bushes impolitely and treated this place as their home.

The cute violent bear and her daughter ran out to take a look. After greeting Catherine, they continued to return to the forest to eat.

Tilly looked at the strange group and her eyes flickered with envy.

After a short rest.

Chu Xiaoye let everyone gather outside the bushes.

Then, he started to choose the team to welcome the pride of the cold father.

They could not have too many. Otherwise, just hunting and eating on the way would take a lot of time.

However, there could not be too few of them.

After all, there were still two young cubs in the pride of the cold father. It was inevitable that they would encounter all sorts of dangers along the way.

The grassland now was not the original grassland.

Mutated species were everywhere, and there were united tribes everywhere.

If there were too few, they might not be able to protect the cubs.

Chu Xiaoye finally chose Catherine, the mixed fur lion king, the blue-eyed lion king, the Jerry brothers, and the Chino brothers.

This group was enough to kill many lions on the grassland.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye knew that it was better to bring the ferocious and brave Jiela sisters rather than the timid Chino brothers.

However, this territory also needed a pride to guard it. The Chino brothers were clearly not up to the task. It was better to let the sisters stay.

With the Jiela sisters and the pride of the blue-eyed lion king, the pride of the mixed fur lion king, and the leopard family, they should be able to resist most wandering lions.

The blue-eyed lion king walked into its pride. As it bid farewell to them, it instructed them to guard this place well.

Belia took the initiative to walk in front of Chu Xiaoye, indicating that she was very bored and could follow him to relieve his boredom on the way and let him bully her.

Chu Xiaoye rejected decisively.

He was going to fetch his family, not to sightsee. Was there a need?

Belia was very disappointed and looked at him resentfully.

At this moment, her father, Blue, walked over and asked Chu Xiaoye to bring the sisters out to broaden their horizons and train.

Leopards lived alone. When they grew up, they had to leave and hunt alone.

Now that their family had been living together, Blue was afraid that the two sisters would slowly know nothing. At that time, once they were alone, they would not be able to survive. Therefore, she wanted to take this opportunity to let them go out to learn survival skills.

For animals, no matter how the world changed, their own strength was true strength.

He would become very fragile in the future if he always relied on them.

The female leopard also walked over and looked pleadingly at Chu Xiaoye, hoping that her daughter could be brought along for this operation.

"Roar…"

Belita lay on the tree and expressed her unwillingness.

However, those bright and shining eyes betrayed her.

She had stayed here for so long that she must be bored to death. She was naturally tempted to return to her former home to take a look.

However, she was afraid that she would be bullied by the big smelly fart again on the way.

At that time, if his mother was not by his side, he would be doomed.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her. He thought that these two sisters were quite skilled and might be useful. At least he could help hunt on the way. Hence, he agreed.

Belia immediately turned her butt in joy and beamed, not caring about her father's embarrassed gaze.

Under Blue and the female leopard's strict reprimand, Belita, who was lying on the tree, could only climb down unhappily and stand behind Belia. She looked at the big smelly fart in front of her that she had known for a long time with a conflicted expression.

Seeing her adorable and unwilling expression, Chu Xiaoye could not help but grin. He walked in front of her, raised his claws, and patted her little head, as if an elder was warning a junior.

"Girl, be obedient on the way. Otherwise, I'll spank your butt\!"

Belita's mouth twitched and she rolled her eyes, but she lowered her head and did not dare to resist.

Everything was ready.

They prepared to set off\!

However, Chu Xiaoye had forgotten about another fellow.

Tilly saw that ever since she came here, she seemed to have become a transparent lion and did not have any sense of existence. No one cared about her\!

She was clearly the noblest white lion, the most dazzling existence, and the most beautiful lioness\!

These blind bastards\!

The most despicable thing was this golden-haired smelly fart king\!

He had chosen so many lions to travel, but he actually did not choose her\!

"Roar—"

She suddenly roared angrily and glared at the lions, indicating that she had a noble status and was not to be trifled with\!

However, when everyone looked at her, the golden-haired smelly fart king suddenly opened his mouth and drooled. He mimicked her previous fool appearance and told everyone, "Ignore her. Her brain is broken and she's a fool. She also contracted a contagious disease. Her yellow fur has become white fur."

The Chino brothers were shocked and hurriedly distanced themselves.

Tilly almost fainted from anger\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and immediately set off with the team.

Bathed in the evening sun and the cool breeze on the grassland, surrounded by six majestic lions, the young king's golden hair fluttered and he was in high spirits\!

Belia twisted her butt and followed behind him.

Belita followed behind Catherine.

Tilly dashed in front of the team again and became the leader of the pride. She prepared to welcome the pride of the cold father with them.

The sisters, Lina, and the pride of the blue-eyed lion king sent them out of the territory.

In order to hurry, Chu Xiaoye did not take a long detour and walked straight towards the distant mountain range.

This way, he naturally could not avoid stepping into the territory of other prides.

Soon, they encountered two lions patrolling the territory.

The two lions were about the same size as the mutated Chino brothers. They looked very tall and strong in front of the lionesses, but once they were in front of the mixed fur lion king and the blue-eyed lion king, they immediately became shorter.

As for the Jerry brothers, they were much older than them.

Therefore, when they saw this powerful team, they immediately swallowed the roar that was about to jump out of their throats.

They turned around and ran.

After running into the distance, he stopped and looked on in fear.

When they realized that this powerful team did not stop in their territory and kept moving forward, they immediately relaxed, as if they had picked up a life.

Along the way, Chu Xiaoye brought the team and broke into many territories.

When most lion kings saw their team, they took the initiative to retreat and watched silently from afar. There was no battle.

There were only one or two prides that relied on their numbers and could not tolerate them trespassing their territory. They rushed up to teach them a lesson.

In the end, before the two sides could officially come into contact, Catherine cut open a few lions' stomachs.

Then, they fled.

As for the wandering lions they encountered on the way, after seeing them from afar, they fled in panic, not daring to come and court death.

They rushed through the night.

When the sun set the next day, they finally walked to the edge of the grassland and arrived at the foot of the mountain range.

Chu Xiaoye saw the deep and mysterious lake again.

When he was resting here, the little elephant was dragged to the bottom of the lake by a few tentacles. He discovered a dinosaur skeleton at the bottom of the lake. The skeleton did not look like a fossil left behind from ancient times.

Thinking about it now, this world had undergone a tremendous change. All sorts of creatures had evolved and mutated. Perhaps a dinosaur really had appeared.

Or perhaps, the dinosaurs had never been extinct but were hiding in a world underground or in the sea.

It was just that humans had yet to come into contact with it.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay here anymore and immediately brought the team into the forest.

The monster at the bottom of the lake was not to be trifled with.

Once he was dragged into the water, no matter how powerful a lion was, he would be doomed.

The road was still rugged.

After the blood-colored rain, the trees and bushes in the forest grew even taller and lush. They almost covered the sky and the light could not be seen.

After the sky turned dark.

The forest was dark and gloomy. The temperature fell and the air was filled with a humid and rotten smell.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and rushed through the night.

When the sun rose the next day, they finally climbed to the top of the mountain.

They encountered a hungry wolf pack on the way, but no battle happened. When the other party saw them, they left directly.

As for the other animals, they had long fled into the distance.

Chu Xiaoye's stamina could still continue forward.

The other members could not tolerate traveling day and night, trekking through mountains and rivers.

The Belia sisters had long complained that they could not walk anymore. They wanted to turn around and return, not to suffer with him again.

The mixed fur lion king and the blue-eyed lion king were also exhausted.

As for the Chino brothers, they had always fallen behind and fell behind many times.

On the other hand, the Jerry brothers seemed to be stronger and had been following closely, but they were already panting.

Although Tilly was also tired and her legs felt like jelly, in order to not be weaker than him in front of everyone, she had been gritting her teeth and persevering. Her gaze at him was filled with resentment, annoyed that he did not know how to be protective of the fairer sex.

Only Catherine followed behind him silently and was not panting. Her stamina seemed to be on par with his.

Chu Xiaoye was very surprised by the potential of this female cub.

It seemed that it was very useful to feed her so much saliva and blood when she was young.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the morning sun and finally stopped. He let everyone rest at the top of the mountain for a day and continue to set off at night.

On the other side of the mountain, the temperature was much higher during the day.

To a lion with a thick mane, a long journey was a great torture, so they could only travel at night.

Tilly fell to the ground and closed her eyes to rest. She did not have the strength to continue pestering him.

The other team members immediately found a shade and lay down.

Belita and Belia climbed up the tree skillfully and lay down on the branch to rest.

Everyone was hungry, but they were also exhausted. Once they lay down, they did not want to get up again.

Looking at their tired appearance, Chu Xiaoye felt that he was a little too anxious.

If they continued to travel like this, their combat strength would be greatly reduced when they encountered danger.

He had to eat his fill and rest well before continuing his journey.

No matter how anxious he was, he was not in a hurry to spend the next few days.

Chu Xiaoye walked to a rock and looked up at the side of the mountain.

The once withered trees were now lush. The once bare mountainside was now covered in green. The grassland further away had turned from its former withered yellow to green.

When he first came, this was a lifeless and dying world.

Now, this place was already overflowing with spring and full of life\!

Nature's life force was always so tenacious.

Every creature had used all their strength and struggled to survive, never giving up.

Chu Xiaoye hoped that this soil that was nurturing countless lives could be forever clean and pure, without being contaminated by the mortal world.

He hoped that the life here would grow endlessly and be wonderful forever.

Because this was his home and the home of countless lives.

Catherine left silently and returned silently. She placed a wild rabbit in front of him to fill his stomach.

Then, the female cub left to hunt again.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her back and thought of everything that had happened in the past. Didn't this little life only survive after stumbling?

Only by knowing the difficulty of life would one know how to cherish life.

Of course, she also knew how to be grateful.

His heart softened and he saved her.

Chu Xiaoye felt that this was the most correct thing he had done since he was reborn.

He looked at the distant grassland and imagined the situation of the pride of the cold father.

Under the care of Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, the situation of the pride should not be too bad, right?

He lowered his head and was about to eat some rabbit meat to fill his stomach when he realized that the wild rabbit Catherine had placed in front of him had suddenly disappeared.

He turned around and saw Tilly tearing the rabbit meat with relish.

The Jerry brothers stood up and came to Tilly's side. They bared their fangs and looked at her angrily.

They were chased by white lions on the snow mountain. Therefore, other than their mother, they hated all white lions.

Chu Xiaoye was their benefactor and their king. Therefore, when they saw that this little white lion had stolen this wild rabbit, they were very angry.

Tilly looked up at them and ignored them. She continued to lower her head and wolf down the food.

She was hungry.

Just as the Jerry brothers were about to pounce on it and bite it, Chu Xiaoye walked over. He extended his claws and grabbed the wild rabbit back. Then, he turned around, raised his hind leg, and suddenly kicked the mouth of this little white lion\!

"Bang\!"

Tilly was caught off guard and her head was raised by the kick. The corner of her mouth broke and blood flowed.

"Roar—"

She immediately jumped up in anger, bared her teeth, and roared.

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

The Jerry brothers, the Chino brothers, the mixed fur lion king, and the blue-eyed lion king all stood up, bared their teeth, and roared, looking at her coldly.

Even the Belita sisters, who were sleeping on the tree, woke up with a roar.

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and looked at the little white lion in front of him. His gaze was calm, as if he was waiting for her to flare up and attack.

"Roar—"

Tilly roared again, bared her teeth, and attacked aggressively. Then, she immediately lay down, closed her eyes, and quickly snored.

"Whoosh… Whoosh…"
