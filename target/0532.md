Chapter 532: Alisa's Conspiracy

The dinner was sumptuous.

Honey roasted whole lamb and pepper tender steak.

To Chu Xiaoye, only this dinner could make him feel the meaning of life.

However, the cute little elves had no appetite and were very nervous.

They were puzzled. Previously, this General Carter had clearly forced them to dance and perform, but now, she suddenly prepared such a sumptuous dinner for them.

What was going on?

One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.

Pure elves understood this principle.

Lanisi ate a few fruits and finally could not help but ask, "General Carter, when can we leave?"

The orc girl sitting on the high seat narrowed her eyes and looked at her. "Why, does the Elven Queen think that I'm not treating you well and want to leave quickly?"

Lanisi hurriedly said, "It's not that the general is lacking in hospitality, but we came out this time because we really have something important to do and have to leave as soon as possible."

The orc girl smiled and said, "Are you going to get reinforcements?"

Lanisi did not answer and looked at the elf youth sitting opposite her.

She did not know how this orc general had tortured her elf youth in the past, making him tired and hungry now. He only knew to bury his head and eat, as if he had completely forgotten that they were in a dangerous place at this moment.

The female general picked up the lamb leg on the table and tore at it. "Lanisi, have you never thought that perhaps I, Carter, am the reinforcements you need the most?"

Vilis mocked, "You will help us? Go and lie to a ghost\!"

Carter smiled and said, "I was going to attack them while the army of the Bolton Kingdom was transferred away. There's nothing to hide. If I occupy their fortress and swing my army up to attack their capital, the danger of your Elf City will naturally be resolved, right?"

Lanisi thought for a moment and looked at her. "From what I know, the Bolton Kingdom will not be so careless to give you a chance to take advantage of them when they retreat from the border. The Bolton Kingdom has always had conflicts with your Kasts. It's impossible for them to not guard against you."

Carter picked up his glass and shook it. He smiled and said, "Therefore, I need your help. Of course, this is also to help yourselves."

Indeed, the dinner tonight was not that delicious.

Lanisi said, "General Carter, please tell us how we can help."

In the tent, other than this General Carter, there were only a few elves. There was not even a guard. Lanisi felt a little strange. Did this girl trust them so much that she would not suddenly go up and catch her and take her away?

Carter put down her wine glass and glanced at them. "You saw it today during the day. The young man I killed was called Mo Ya. He is the son of the prime minister of my Kingdom of Kast. His aunt is now my father's new queen. Now, the Mo Ya family's Lusni, is in charge of the largest military authority in my Kingdom of Kast. Even my father is afraid of him. Therefore, I need you to help me eliminate them and help me reclaim my military authority\!"

Lanisi frowned. How could the few of them help with this?

Furthermore, they still had very important things to do. How could they have the time to delay here?

She looked opposite, hoping that the youth could speak. After all, his intelligence and eloquence crushed theirs.

However, to her amusement, that fellow was still burying his head in the meat and ignoring her gaze.

"Of course, the seizing of power definitely needs to be done step by step."

Seeing that she did not answer, Carter drank a mouthful of wine and put down her glass. She said, "Now, on the southern border, other than my team of more than 8,000 people, there is another 10,000-man army stationed. The leader of their army, Geck, is Mo Ya's brother. This time, I hope that you can help me first, kill him, and snatch the army and authority in his hands. As long as this matter is successful, I guarantee that you can leave here safely."

Lanisi smiled bitterly. "General Carter thinks too highly of us. The other party has ten thousand troops. Aren't we going to die with just the few of us?"

Was she asking them to be killers and assassinate the other party?

Carter stood up and walked down from above. He came to her table, picked up his wine glass, and poured her a glass of red wine. He said, "Lanisi, Mo Ya died tragically here. I have already released the news that it was you guys who did it, and I have already caught you guys and am waiting to deal with you. I believe that after Geck gets the news, he will immediately come and take revenge for his brother. At that time…"

Lanisi's expression changed slightly.

Chu Xiaoye finally could not help but put down the meat in his hand and look up. "General Carter, I think you're too optimistic and rash about this matter. The other party is actually the leader of a ten-thousand-man army. He's naturally not a stupid person. Mo Ya died tragically in your camp. You have the greatest responsibility. He won't be fooled so easily."

Carter turned to look at him and smiled. "He will. If his younger brother dies, he will be the one to marry me, Geck Lusni. This is a political marriage, and he will not give up. Furthermore, I'm so beautiful and proud, and I'm a member of the royal family. I also released the news in advance that I'm preparing to attack the Bolton Kingdom. I have no reason to kill his younger brother. Therefore, he will definitely come."

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and picked up the lamb leg on the table again. "I hope so."

Carter turned around and walked in front of him. She placed her hands on the table in front of her and bent down to look at him, revealing her curves. She smiled and said, "Lord Night, I'll just ask if you're willing to help me?"

"This…"

Chu Xiaoye looked past her slender body at the queen opposite him.

Lanisi said with confidence, "Night, you decide. You're the leader of our team."

Carter's eyes revealed a hint of ridicule and he deliberately said in a strange tone, "Ah, I really couldn't tell. It turns out that Lord Night is the leader\! Then, what about the queen, the noble Elven Queen? Could it be that she has already become Lord Night's lackey?"

"What?"

Lanisi did not understand and looked puzzled.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He glared at the orc girl and told her to shut up.

Carter did not shut up and continued, "It seems that Lord Night is small and capable. Even the elven queen is willing to submit to you and let you do whatever you want with her. Oh, no, I mean, she is at your disposal."

Chu Xiaoye was afraid that she would talk nonsense again and hurriedly said, "Alright, I'll help you\! Since General Carter is so kind, we have nothing to repay you with. I'll help you kill a few people as a reward."

Lanisi frowned, feeling worried.

Vilis suddenly said, "I don't agree."

Carter narrowed his eyes and was about to flare up. Chu Xiaoye immediately took the lead and pointed at the huge sword loli, reprimanding her, "Stop talking\! If I don't let you speak, shut up\! Her Majesty said that I'm your leader. My words are the king's orders\!"

Vilis said angrily, "You can't decide our lives\!"

Carter suddenly turned around and looked at her. She mocked, "But I can decide your life and death, right?"

"Vilis, listen to Night. Let's do whatever Night says."

Lanisi said solemnly.

This was not the time to be stubborn.

Vilis could only sit down unwillingly and say, "Yes, Your Majesty."

"Then."

Carter picked up the wine glass in front of Chu Xiaoye and smiled at the female elves. "I wish our cooperation a success\!"

With that said, she raised her neck and drank it all.

Late at night, the banquet ended.

If not for this enthusiastic General Carter constantly persuading them to drink, Lanisi and the others would have long left.

The few elf girls only drank a few glasses of red wine and their faces were red. They were so drunk that they could not walk.

Fortunately, Denise insisted on not drinking, and Lanisi only drank a few glasses.

Carter got up to send them off and smiled. "I hope the beautiful elves can sleep well tonight."

Fei'er swayed and said, "Lord… Lord Night, come and support Her Majesty."

Actually, she and Vilis were the ones who needed support.

Denise supported her, and Lanisi supported Vilis.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to leave with them, General Carter suddenly said, "Sorry, in my camp, men and women can't sleep together. Lanisi, go back first. I'll find another place for your Lord Night."

Lanisi frowned and said, "Night has always been with me."

She became a little vigilant. Could it be that this General Carter was still angry at her for being insulted that night and wanted to torture Night tonight?

Carter shook his head and said solemnly, "Sorry, not here."

Her tone was very determined and could not be refused. She said, "You guys go back first. Don't worry. Since we've already worked together, I naturally won't do anything to your Lord Night. Could it be that I can eat him?"

Lanisi looked at Chu Xiaoye, still a little worried.

Chu Xiaoye could only say, "Your Majesty, it's okay. Go to sleep first. I'll sleep elsewhere."

Since he said that he was fine, he was definitely fine.

Lanisi nodded and left with the drunk Vilis.

With Denise' help, Fei'er was still swaying and her face was red. She turned around and waved at Chu Xiaoye. "Lord Night, you… you have to come quickly. Her Majesty is waiting for you."

After they walked out of the tent, Carter grabbed Chu Xiaoye's ear and sneered. "Did you hear that? The Elven Queen is waiting for you?"

Chu Xiaoye did not back down and grabbed her ear as well. "I heard you. I'm not deaf."

Carter suddenly said, "Then are you a lion?"

"Of course\!"

Chu Xiaoye said without hesitation.

However, when he finished answering, he suddenly realized that the situation was bad.

Carter let go of his ear and looked at him with watery eyes. He smiled and said, "Alright. Then, tonight, you will show your might as a lion and accompany General Carter."

With that said, she grabbed his wrist and pulled him into the tent she was resting in at the back.

Before the sky lit up, Ha'er's report came from outside the tent. "General, General Geck has already brought people here. They're already two kilometers away."

Carter's lazy voice sounded from the tent. "How many people did he bring?"

Ha'er reported, "According to the scouts, they only brought about ten or so."

"More than ten?"

Carter's laughter sounded in the tent. "Alright, go and prepare. We have to welcome General Geck today."

Ha'er bowed and left.

"Good brother, look, my charm is not much inferior to when I was a lioness, right?"

Under the soft and warm blanket, the two naked bodies were stuck together. At this moment, General Carter seemed to have become a little lamb that was ridiculously gentle.

Chu Xiaoye hugged her smooth and tender body and could not help but complain, "As a lioness, you didn't have much charm."

The girl was not angry. She smiled and said, "Then, who was the one who was intimate with me at night and rolling around?"

Chu Xiaoye thought of that scene and for some reason, he suddenly felt that it hurt his eyes.

"Alisa, although the other party only brought a dozen guards, we still can't underestimate them. Remember how we used to hunt on the grassland? No matter how small the prey is or how weak they are, even if it's just a rabbit or a mouse, we will still fight with all our might. Now that you have become an orc, if you want to succeed, you have to do so. Don't underestimate anyone in the world."

Chu Xiaoye said sincerely.

The girl opened her mouth and bit his chin. Then, she giggled and said, "I know, Teacher Night."

After dawn, the two of them came out of the tent one after another.

Ha'er looked at the young elf in front of him. Even if he racked his brains, he could not understand why his general liked this kid. Were muscular men and strong orcs not nice?

Lanisi and the others woke up very early and could not sleep in the tent.

When Fei'er got up, her head hurt a little. She regretted drinking so much last night and making a fool of herself.

Vilis did not say a word, and no one knew who she was angry at.

When Chu Xiaoye's voice sounded from outside, the worry on the faces of the female elves disappeared.

"Beautiful elves, are you awake? Can I come in?"

As Chu Xiaoye spoke, he had already opened the curtain and walked in.

Vilis carried the huge sword and guarded the door. When she saw him enter, she immediately turned her face and looked elsewhere to show that she was angry.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked to the Queen's side. Just as he was about to speak, Fei'er, who was close, suddenly pointed at his chin and said, "Lord Night, you're injured? It's a tooth mark\! Who bit you? Is it an orc?"

Lanisi hurriedly looked at his chin with anger on her face. "Night, did Carter order the orcs to beat you up last night?"

Fei'er suddenly pointed at Chu Xiaoye's lips and said, "Your Majesty, look. Lord Night is so pitiful. His mouth is also injured. Those orcs are so despicable. They actually did not let go of Lord Night's cute mouth."

Vilis suddenly walked over quickly and grabbed the collar behind Chu Xiaoye's back. She pulled it down and realized that his white back was filled with teeth marks and scratches.

"Wuwu…"

Fei'er cried out in heartache and wiped her tears. "Poor Lord Night. For us, he compromised and was actually covered in wounds. He must have been abused by that despicable woman for an entire night last night, right?"

Vilis said angrily, "I'll go find her\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly grabbed her and said, "Don't, I'm fine. It's just a small injury. I'll be fine tomorrow."

The prerequisite was that the damn girl could let him go today.

"Night, what's wrong with your wounds?"

Lanisi looked at him suspiciously. If the orcs wanted to abuse and beat him, they did not need to use their mouths and nails. He was covered in nail marks and teeth marks. This was too strange.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, actually, these injuries were left behind by General Carter."

Should he admit it?

Of course not\!

"I knew that fellow did it\! Let go and let me find her\! I, Vilis, am not afraid of her\!"

The huge sword loli looked very angry.

Chu Xiaoye continued, "Actually, General Carter also has these injuries. I left them behind."

"Huh?"

The female elves were stunned.

Lanisi said, "Night, what's going on?"

Chu Xiaoye said with a serious expression, "Your Majesty, it's like this. Weren't we going to perform a good show together today? I was afraid that you were too innocent and would not lie, and accidentally revealed your identity, so I thought of a solution. When Lord Carter went to my tent to find me this morning, I suddenly attacked her and rolled on the ground with her in my arms. She did not want to be outdone and hugged me, biting and grabbing. In the end, we fought to a draw. General Carter was very angry and instructed the guards to tie us up. In a while, when that General Geck comes, he will kill us. Therefore, we are already under house arrest and will be tied out soon. Furthermore, if we are really tied out, we might really be killed by General Carter."

Lanisi looked at him in a daze and said in confusion, "Night, I don't understand. You mean that you deliberately angered General Carter. Now, we really have to be handed over to General Geck and killed by him, right?"

Chu Xiaoye nodded and said, "Yes, Your Majesty is so smart."

Fei'er said, "But Lord Night, didn't we already tell General Carter? If we want to work with her, why would she really kill us?"

Lanisi raised her hand and said, "Fei'er, wait. Why do I feel that what Night just said seems to be… being…"

"Nonsense\!"

Denise, who had always been silent, suddenly spoke coldly.

She was once the personal guard of the previous queen of the elves and had seen countless cases of queens having an affair. She naturally knew how the marks on this young elf's body were created.

However, she did not say anything.

As long as it did not harm Her Majesty, she would continue to be silent.

However, she could not help it now because this fellow's words were too fake. She could not watch on anymore. He was treating the Queen and them as idiots.

"Hehe."

Chu Xiaoye chuckled and raised his thumb at Denise. He said without blushing, "Denise is still the best. I'm indeed talking nonsense. Forget it, I won't hide it. I can't be afraid that you'll be sad and guilty and lie. I have to tell the truth\!"

He took a deep breath, raised his head, and said impassionedly, "Yes, you're right. The wounds on me were indeed abused by that despicable General Carter\! She wanted to lure me to betray you and rely on her, but I rejected her fiercely\! Therefore, she flew into a rage out of humiliation and let a thick man abuse me for the entire night with his fangs and nails\! However, don't worry, I'd rather die than submit\!"

"But, Night, these teeth and nails…"

Lanisi was about to speak when Chu Xiaoye suddenly pointed outside and said, "They're here\! They're here\!"

It was indeed here.

The curtain was opened. Ha'er had brought people and ropes and was preparing to tie them up.

General Carter had already brought his men to the entrance of the camp to welcome the famous General Geck.

Today, another bloodbath could not be avoided\!
