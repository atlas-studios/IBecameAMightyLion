Chapter 174: The Might of the Golden Claw\!

The pride came.

The leopard family on the tree immediately became nervous.

When the blue-eyed lion king saw the corpses of the two foreign lions and the black mane on the ground, its face immediately distorted. It bared its fangs and prepared to roar again.

However, he endured it.

He could not let his subordinates and the leopards on the tree hear from his roars that he was already flustered and helpless and started to be afraid.

Yes, he started to fear.

The foreign little lion's sneak attack and cunning intelligence terrified him\!

However, the more terrified he was, the more he could not let go\!

He could never allow the existence of a lion that threatened his throne in this territory\!

No matter what, he had to kill that kid tonight\!

Even if they had to pay the price of the pride\!

The blue-eyed lion king raised its head and looked at the four leopards on the tree.

The other lions looked fearfully at the corpse on the ground and the bloody head.

The terrifyingness of that cub exceeded all their expectations\!

Even the black-haired lion, one of the Five "Great Deities", was killed silently and its head was bitten off and its corpse separated\!

This was unbelievable\!

On the tree, the leopard family trembled under the blue-eyed lion's cold and terrifying gaze, their hearts filled with fear.

Belia could not help but look at the tree opposite.

The blue-eyed lion king retracted its gaze and ignored them. It immediately led the team and continued to search.

Soon, he disappeared into the distant bushes.

"Roar\!"

At this moment, Belita called out, as if she was saying, "You scared me to death."

A moment later.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and landed steadily on the ground.

He decided to kill all the lions guarding the outer circle first\!

However, just as he was about to leave, a few strong lions suddenly jumped out from the bushes in front of him\!

In the forest on both sides, two groups of lions and female lions quickly ran out\!

His heart sank. He immediately turned around and ran back\!

"Whoosh—"

Right at this moment, a strong wind assaulted him\!

The blue-eyed lion king's huge and strong body suddenly jumped out of the grass and its huge claws smashed at him like a hammer\!

Chu Xiaoye could not dodge and could only swing his right claw to block\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The blue-eyed lion king landed on the ground and did not move.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he flew out and fell to the ground in a sorry state. His body rolled and he jumped up again.

At this moment.

This powerful pride, be it the lion or the lionesses, rushed out of the surrounding forest and surrounded him\!

It turned out that they already knew that he was hiding here\!

Even the members guarding the outer circle rushed over and prepared to kill him completely here\!

On the tree.

Belita's claws that were holding onto the branches trembled slightly. She stared at him and the group of murderous lions surrounding him in fear\!

Although he had killed many members of the pride, there were still more than twenty of them.

They were all tall and strong\!

Counting just tall and sturdy\!

This was a super pride with extremely terrifying combat strength\!

Belita found it difficult to imagine why a pride had so many members.

Over at their side, there were at most ten plus lions in a pride and cubs. If there were more, they would starve to death.

The pride here not only had many members, but they were also strong. Even the female lions were larger than the male lions on the other side of the mountain. She could not understand.

Would he still survive if he was surrounded by such a super pride?

The blue-eyed lion king bared its fangs and looked coldly at the foreign little lion in front of it. It no longer had its previous calm and indifference.

He was angry and hateful, afraid and jealous\!

"Roar—"

He did not hesitate and immediately gave the pride their all\!

"Attack together\! Kill this cub\!"

The entire pride immediately shared a common enemy and roared as they pounced forward\!

As for the blue-eyed lion king, it stood nearby with a dark gaze and did not move.

His motionlessness made Chu Xiaoye feel even more pressure\!

Seeing the surrounding lions pouncing ferociously, Chu Xiaoye knew that he could only risk it all and break out in one direction\!

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly turned around and rushed to the side\!

The two lions and the female lions at the front opened their fangs and pounced over with ferocious expressions. He suddenly jumped up, jumped six to seven meters high, and rushed towards the trees at the side\!

"Bam\!"

He did not land on the tree. Instead, he used the tree trunk as a springboard. Just as his limbs landed on the tree trunk, he suddenly jumped up and instantly changed his direction, jumping forward\!

This sudden diversionary attack stunned the entire pride\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately passed the encirclement in front of him. Just as he was about to land on the ground, a strong wind suddenly came from behind. Before he could dodge, a huge claw slapped him ruthlessly on the back with a bang\!

"Bang\!"

He fell heavily to the ground, and a sharp pain came from his back\!

However, he did not stop at all. He quickly rolled on the ground a few times and jumped up\!

"Bang\!"

At this moment, the huge claw happened to slap the ground where he had fallen previously\!

If he had hesitated just now, he would never be able to stand up again\!

The blue-eyed lion king stood where he had fallen previously and stared at him coldly. It could not believe his reaction speed and resistance.

Usually, with one slap, even an adult lion would have its spine broken and fall to the ground, unable to get up.

But now, after being slapped by him, this kid could still instantly roll out and jump up\!

This made him even more afraid\!

The pride reacted very quickly.

When Chu Xiaoye was slapped and fell to the ground, they had already rushed over. At this moment, when Chu Xiaoye jumped up, he was surrounded again.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place, his back burning with pain and his limbs trembling.

However, the strange heat in his abdomen was flowing to his back and throughout his body at an extremely fast speed, healing the wounds on his back and increasing his strength again\!

But he could not jump for the time being.

Furthermore, this blue-eyed lion king's jumping ability did not seem to be inferior to his. It seemed to be waiting for him to jump into the air and be unable to turn around to dodge when it suddenly attacked\!

Looking at the ferocious lions approaching, Chu Xiaoye knew that there was no other way other than to risk his life\!

He had already killed so many powerful lions with his own strength. Even if he died in battle here, he would never lower his dignity as a lion\!

Furthermore, wanting his life was not so simple\!

His life could at least kill ten of their powerful members\!

It was worth it\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and took the initiative to pounce on a lion\!

This was one of the five "Great Deities" of the blue-eyed lion king\!

Although that lion was a little afraid of him, the arrow was on the bow and he had no choice but to release it. His king was watching\!

He immediately roared angrily and brought the two lions and the female lions behind him to bare their fangs and pounce ferociously\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye almost risked his life. He did not dodge or hesitate and charged over ferociously at his fastest speed\!

His lowered head instantly hit the lion's open mouth\!

Before the lion could react, it was sent flying by this huge force and hit the two lions behind it\!

The two lions were caught off guard and suddenly fell back, colliding with the female lions behind them\!

Chu Xiaoye fell to the ground.

However, the lion, one of the five "Great Deities", had its mouth broken from the impact. Blood splashed everywhere and it rolled on the ground, letting out a miserable scream\!

The two lions and the female lions behind him fell to the ground\!

Chu Xiaoye stood up. Blood flowed out of his head and instantly covered his entire face.

He did not feel pain.

He only felt his blood boil and his strength surge\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

When the three female lions took the opportunity to pounce ferociously from the side, he suddenly raised his claws and slapped them away\!

However, behind him and on both sides, they were bitten by the lions and female lions that pounced on them\!

He rolled out and swung his claws again, retreating as he fought\!

When the surrounding lions swarmed ferociously again, he suddenly jumped up, wanting to use the trees beside him to jump out of the encirclement.

This time, his jump was only three meters tall.

However, before he could land on the tree trunk at the side, a figure suddenly pounced down from a higher place and slapped him on the head\!

"Bang\!"

He suddenly flew out diagonally like a kite with a broken string and landed heavily on the ground.

He was dizzy and his vision turned black\!

He shook his head hard, and a warm current rushed into his mind, causing him to immediately wake up\!

He got up and retreated under a big tree. His face was covered in blood\!

Not only was his head slapped heavily by the blue-eyed lion king, it was also badly mutilated by the sharp claws\!

Seeing his terrifying appearance but still standing steadily, the pride that rushed to his side immediately stopped in their tracks, feeling a chill in their hearts. For a moment, they were frightened and did not dare to go forward.

The muscles on the blue-eyed lion king's face twitched as it looked at him coldly and in disbelief.

On the tree, the male leopard's muscles were tense. He widened his eyes and almost stopped breathing.

At the highest point, Belita's body trembled violently. She stared fixedly at the pitiful figure covered in blood. The scene of him bullying him and saving her suddenly appeared in her mind.

Her vision gradually blurred.

She knew that he could not escape anymore.

She knew that from today onwards, he would never be able to bully her again.

However, why was she not happy at all?

"Roar—"

At this moment, another lion, one of the "Five Great Deities", immediately roared angrily and pounced forward\!

He wanted to take revenge for his brothers\!

He wanted to show his courage and fearlessness in front of the king\!

His huge and strong body was like a small hill as it crushed towards the weak figure covered in blood\!

His four sharp fangs were like sharp blades that flickered with a cold light\!

In this territory, other than his king, no one could resist his fierce and powerful pounce\!

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly lit up in the night\!

Like a meteor that cut through the night sky\!

His huge body, which had just pounced close, suddenly paused and fell to the ground with a bang\!

"Chi—"

A stream of blood suddenly sprayed out from the middle of his head\!

Then, his entire head suddenly split into two with a crack\!

Fresh blood and brains splashed all over the ground\!
