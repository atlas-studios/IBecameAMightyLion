Chapter 489: Battle Beast

The Elf City was very quiet.

It did not look prosperous or lively.

The market was also quite bleak, and there were not many elves wandering or trading.

Most elves were very slender.

Chu Xiaoye walked all the way and did not see a fatty.

Vilis brought them into the castle and encountered Annie, who was standing at the door being interrogated severely, and the big black bear facing the elven guard with a spear.

The elven guard's ridicule was very ear-piercing. "Princess Annie? Is it the Princess Annie who betrayed us and killed our companions? Oh, sorry, she has already left with her little white tiger. We know her. You're not her."

Another elf guard even pulled out the knife at his waist and threatened, "Impostor, if you don't scram, don't blame us for being impolite\!"

Annie stood there with flickering eyes and a serious expression.

She did not know how to explain.

Could she be saying that I'm actually the shadow of Lady Annie?

"She's the real Princess Annie."

At this moment, Vilis walked to Annie's side and looked coldly at the guards. She said coldly, "That traitor was only an impostor pretending to be Princess Annie. After we saw through her, she fled. This is the true Princess Annie."

"Lady Vilis\! This…"

The guards were stunned when they heard this and looked like they did not believe it.

However, since Lady Vilis was here to protect them, there was nothing difficult for them.

"Alright, Princess… Princess Annie, please come in."

They made way.

The tallest castle was sitting on a mountain peak. Clouds were lingering on it, and birds were singing and flowers were fragrant. It was like a fairyland, the residence of the fairy royal family.

However, Vilis was not preparing to bring them to the palace for the time being.

She brought them to her mansion, a garden ancient castle that was on the verge of a cliff.

Although this ancient castle was not as tall as the ancient castle where the royal family lived, it was still a symbol of nobility. With the garden, it occupied at least 2,000 square meters.

If he had to add the fiefs that Vilis had around him, the area would be even more terrifying.

This place seemed to be vast and sparsely populated.

Along the way, there were fields and scenery like poems and paintings. It was a completely different world from the snow outside. However, Chu Xiaoye did not see many elves.

Even when he came to Vilis' residence, he did not see many elves.

Annie was also puzzled and could not help but ask, "Vilis, why are there so few people? Where did they go?"

Vilis brought them into the garden and said calmly, "They're all dead. Ten thousand people died in the last war. Now, our city only has a thousand people. Furthermore, most of them are women and children."

She turned around and looked at Annie. "Did you see the guards guarding the door just now? They're all lucky people who have just reached adulthood and have yet to go to the battlefield. Furthermore, a few of them are nobles."

When she said this, she sighed and said, "We don't have many people left. If you can't lure her out and kill her this time, she will soon bring the enemy and trample our city. At that time, our tribe will no longer exist."

Annie frowned and said solemnly, "Who is our enemy?"

Vilis walked in front and was silent for a while before saying, "Many. There are humans, orcs, and other… other elves."

"Other elves?"

Annie was even more puzzled.

Vilis tightened her grip on the huge sword on her shoulder, and the silver hair draped behind her fluttered despite the absence of wind. Her gaze was bone-chilling. "Many of the elves captured by the orcs have become enemies and given birth to more powerful descendants for the orcs. Most of our people died at the hands of those little monsters."

"Those little monsters were born with the talent to summon war beasts. They have the sensitivity of us elves and the muscles of the orcs. They are very strong."

Annie turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye. She muttered, "No wonder you always wanted a powerful war beast."

The garden was very big and there were beautiful trees and flowers everywhere. They walked for a long time.

However, he did not see a single elf.

This beautiful place immediately looked a little cold.

Vilis seemed to be teaching Annie a lesson and continued, "When you came, you should have noticed the forest covered in snow outside, right? That's the snow guardian forest passed down from ancient times by us elves. It has always protected us from being discovered by outsiders. But now, there are already Orcs who can enter."

At this point, she turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye realized that those orcs just now were scouts who had come for the elves.

"Therefore, we will be discovered by the orcs soon. At that time, they will come out in full strength and attack us. The orcs have always been enemies of humans, but they have always been suppressed by humans. The reason why they have always been targeting us elves is because they fancy our physiques. They want to bring us back and give birth to more powerful descendants for them. Then, they will take revenge on humans."

Vilis pushed open a wooden door and brought them into another garden.

After walking for a while, an empty space with only a grassland suddenly appeared in front of him. There was a huge iron cage in the empty space, and in the cage lay a saber-toothed tiger with its fangs bared.

The saber-toothed tiger was sleeping with its eyes narrowed. When it heard the noise, it immediately opened its eyes and let out a low growl.

When it saw Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, it was first stunned. Then, it bared its fangs and started to roar. Its sharp claws started to grab the bars of the cage violently with a murderous aura\!

"Vilis, this is…"

Annie looked at the saber-toothed tiger with a puzzled expression, not knowing why Vilis brought them here.

At this moment, a young elf with a walking stick and a limp suddenly walked out from behind a tree at the side.

He was wearing silver armor and had two exquisite medals on his chest. His gaze was bright and sharp. He had a small scar on his forehead and his silver hair was tied into a ponytail. He was slender and was not considered tall.

He quickly walked over and smiled brightly at Vilis. "Vilis, you're finally back. This saber-toothed tiger is already hungry at the most appropriate time. It can tear apart any ferocious beast with one move."

At this point, he looked at Annie and the two lions behind her.

When he saw the bald Chu Xiaoye, he was clearly stunned.

Alice said coldly, "Lord Lori, you haven't greeted Princess Annie yet."

The young elf named Lori narrowed his eyes and looked at Annie with a faint smile. He let out a fake surprised voice. "Oh, God, this is really Princess Annie\! It turns out that Princess Annie did not betray and escape. I'm sorry, Your Highness. I did not recognize you just now. Please don't blame me."

The upper echelons of the elves knew that this Princess Annie was fake just to lure the real one out.

As the former captain of the royal guards and a noble, he naturally knew.

Annie naturally heard his ridicule, but she did not mind. She nodded and said, "It's Lord Lori."

Lori ignored her and looked at Alice eagerly. She smiled and said, "You told me last time that a good friend would give you a very powerful war beast. Then, compared to this big fellow I gave you, do you think that it's more suitable to be your war beast?"

"I don't know."

Vilis shrugged and looked at Chu Xiaoye. "I'm afraid we won't know until we compare."
