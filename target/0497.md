Chapter 497: The Eternal King\!

In the evening, someone came from the palace.

The captain of the imperial guards, Viscount Boren, personally brought the six royal guards to Vilis' residence to welcome her.

His meaning was obvious. She had to go.

This sense of coercion and threat made Vilis very unhappy.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye was even more unhappy.

However, he had to go this time.

Vilis carried her huge sword and had a cold expression. She brought them away from the mansion under the escort of the palace guards, rode her horse, and rushed to the palace.

Although the horses here were not afraid of ferocious beasts, Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, and the big black bear, Tibbs, could not ride them. They could only follow behind and walk.

The horse raised its head and stuck out its chest. It strode forward without looking at them and looked extremely pleased.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly suspected what Annie had said to him previously.

Annie said that animals in this world could survive openly like humans. They could even become friends, partners, or masters with humans.

However, he did not see it.

He only saw that the weak would always be enslaved.

Even this beautiful Kingdom of Elves was no exception.

Now, he was on the way to perform acrobatics for the elves.

This was not a world that was friendly to animals.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly quickened his steps and walked in front of the horse with Catherine. He did not want to continue following behind to eat dust and smell their pleased and pitiful slave stench.

"Giddy up\!"

Just as he walked to the entrance of the palace, a team of guards escorted a carriage over quickly.

The animals pulling the carriage were not horses, but two lions in their prime.

The bodies of the two lions were comparable to that of horses. The mane on their necks was black and shining, and their limbs were thick and strong. Their faces were still dignified and fierce, but their amber eyes no longer had the wildness and aura of lions.

When they pulled the carriage close, they suddenly stopped.

The two black-haired lions naturally looked at Chu Xiaoye and Catherine.

They were first stunned, then their eyes revealed a hint of surprise, as if they were very happy to encounter their own kind here. However, soon, the light in their eyes dimmed.

"Bam\!"

An iron whip suddenly flew out of the carriage and slapped heavily on the butt of one of the lions.

The two lions trembled at the same time, lowered their heads, and sat on the ground. They lowered their eyes and pricked up their ears, obedient and docile like two puppies.

The curtain was opened and a head popped out.

This was a boy with a childish face, silver hair, blue eyes, and a high nose. He was probably only twelve or thirteen years old.

However, the expression on his face seemed extremely mature.

"Yo, Lady Vilis\!"

The elf boy's expression changed very quickly and he said with a smile, "I heard from my mother that you will have a very exciting performance tonight, right? I gave up the game of hunting in the Red Valley with Zat and the others and rushed back. Don't disappoint me."

With that said, he looked at the bald Chu Xiaoye with a strange expression.

"Prince William\!"

Viscount Boren hurriedly greeted respectfully.

Vilis was still cold. She only nodded slightly and did not say anything, as if she had already greeted him.

Prince William frowned slightly, but he quickly recovered.

He looked at Chu Xiaoye with interest, then used his whip to point at the two mighty and strong black-haired lions in front of him. He smiled and said, "Lady Vilis, if you had told me earlier that you liked these rough big cats, I would have given you one. Look at you. You brought a furless and seedless one. If others see it, they will say that my royal family mistreats you, a meritorious subject."

Vilis' face was cold and she still did not speak.

It could be seen that there seemed to be some friction between her and this little prince.

Prince William did not seem to have noticed her coldness and impatience. He still blocked the door and said with a fake smile, "Lady Vilis, could this bald lion be the lion that killed Baron Olis, as Mother said? Tsk tsk, why do I feel that you're deliberately teasing Mother?"

Vilis finally opened her mouth and said coldly, "Your Highness, can you move away now?"

Prince William shrugged and said, "Of course you can. However, I want to confirm again if Lady Vilis really brought this bald animal to the palace to perform?"

Vilis looked at him coldly and did not answer.

"Clang\!"

Prince William suddenly crawled out of the carriage and pulled out the sword at his waist. His sword flashed and he slashed at the black-haired lion whose butt he had slapped\!

"Pfft—"

Blood sprayed\!

The huge lion's head rolled to the ground with its glossy black mane.

The lion's headless corpse was still squatting upright on the ground. After a few seconds, it fell to the ground.

The remaining lion immediately turned limp in fear and fell to the ground, trembling. It let out a low and hoarse plea.

Prince William raised the sharp sword in his hand and wiped the blood on its butt before putting it into the sheath.

He grinned at Vilis and said, "Since Lady Vilis would rather fancy a furless animal than me, why is it still alive?"

Vilis tightened her grip on the sword hilt, clearly holding back.

William turned around and returned to the carriage. She put down the carriage and said, "Let's go."

Although it was just a casual word, the lion that was limp and trembling on the ground trembled in fear. It immediately jumped up from the ground and pulled the carriage away.

When they passed by Chu Xiaoye, the curtain on the side of the carriage suddenly opened.

Prince William stuck out his head and smiled at him warmly. "I'll wait for your performance. I'll reserve a spot in front of this carriage for you."

With that said, he put down the curtain and entered the palace door.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the bloody corpse on the ground and his widened eyes. His heart turned cold at first, but then, with a whoosh, hot flames ignited.

"He's not targeting you."

Vilis seemed to see his anger and whispered.

This cold comfort did not extinguish the flames in Chu Xiaoye's heart.

From this, it could be seen that the elves did not treat animals like them as Annie had said.

What was the difference between these sparkling and pure elves and some cruel, cold-blooded, and perverted humans?

"Let's go."

Vilis urged coldly and rode in front of him.

Annie looked at him sadly, her delicate face filled with guilt, as if she had done this cruel thing.

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then opened them again.

He followed behind with a calm expression, but his body emitted the aura of a king of the grassland again.

The king of the grassland had never left\!

Today, he would let these elves who viewed animals as ants and slaughtered them as they pleased understand that some animals would always be kings no matter where they were\! As for some animals, no matter how ostentatious they were, the blood of the dirty and the weak flowed in their bones\!

He was a lion, not an elf\!

He was a king and always would be\!

"Clang…"

In the palace, the evening bell sounded.

On the horizon, the setting sun was like blood.
