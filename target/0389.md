Chapter 389: Untitled

"Roarâ€”"

The two little fellows immediately cried out in fear. They jumped up and fell to the ground with terrified expressions.

Then, they quickly got up, turned around, and ran. They immediately crawled into the hole that had just been dug and hid inside, trembling.

Towards these two cowards, even Pit could not watch on.

How could the descendants of lions be so timid?

Pit quickly walked in front of the python that had lost its head and bit its still struggling body, eating it.

After a long time, Qiqi and Nunu stuck their heads out of the cave timidly and looked over in fear.

However, before the two of them could muster their courage to walk over and enjoy it, the cold father beside them suddenly got up and walked over first, eating with a disdainful expression.

The cold father was already hungry and dizzy.

Although this python did not suit his appetite, it could at least fill his stomach and let him recover some strength and spirit.

Seeing that the cold father had come, Pit took the initiative to leave and continued to dig holes.

After Little Mi ate and drank his fill, he walked to the grass at the side and lay down to rest.

The cold father enjoyed the python alone and ate with relish.

Qiqi and Nunu finally could not tolerate their hunger and crawled out of the cave. Just as they were close, the cold father suddenly turned his head, bared his fangs, and roared at them to scram.

The two little fellows immediately peed their pants in fear. They turned around and ran, crawling into the cave again.

The little girl, who was sitting under a tree not far away, felt that this scene was very interesting.

They were all the children of this lion, but this lion only dared to show its father's dignity and ferocity in front of these two young cubs. In front of the other three children, it could only become a gentle, honest, and obedient father.

It turned out that not only did humans bully the weak and fear the strong, lions did so too.

This even happened between a father and his children.

Just as the little girl was watching with relish, the cold father suddenly picked up the remaining python body and walked in front of her. He threw the meaty food under her feet and turned to leave.

He was still cold and dignified.

The little girl was stunned for a moment. She looked down at the python corpse in front of her, then looked up at his back with a shocked expression.

Was this proud and strange lion father fawning on her?

"Of course not\!"

The cold father lay in the grass not far away and sneered in his heart.

Since you saw it, I naturally have to shut your mouth. I ate, you ate, and everyone ate. In this way, when that unfilial son returned, he could not blame only me for snatching the little fellow's food.

This was the cold father's idea.

However, the little girl was not willing to eat this python.

At least not yet.

She wanted to wait for the king to bring back more delicious food.

Therefore, she immediately walked in front of the cave and called out to Qiqi and Nunu, who were hiding inside, to come out and let the two of them go over to eat the remaining python corpse.

Qiqi and Nunu stuck their heads out of the cave and saw that their dignified and tall father had already left. They hurriedly climbed out and ran towards the python, starting to wolf down the food.

"Roarâ€”"

Right at this moment, Maya's roar suddenly came from the forest on the right\!

The cold father suddenly jumped up from the ground and quickly ran over.

At the same time, the Jerry brothers, the sisters, and the other members who were looking for prey nearby hurriedly ran over.

When the cold father ran close, he did not see the enemy. He only saw Maya standing there with her face covered in blood and her body trembling non-stop. Xi'er and Aisha, the two female lions, stood on the other side, also trembling and looking terrified.

On the grass in front of them lay a female lion. Her neck was broken, her skull had collapsed, and she was bleeding from her seven apertures. Her stomach had been cut open and she died miserably.

That was Callie.

The cold father froze in place and did not move.

The Jerry brothers rushed over, and the Jiela sisters rushed over with the female lions. The other members ran over.

When they saw this scene, they were terrified and in disbelief.

"Roarâ€”"

The Jerry brothers immediately roared angrily and followed the scent towards the forest in front of them.

Qiqi and Nunu ran over in panic and went to Maya's side. They rubbed against their mother's body, their eyes filled with fear.

Maya licked the fur on their bodies lovingly, and a deep scratch appeared on her face.

The cold father finally woke up and slowly moved his feet to walk in front of Callie. He looked down at his poor wife.

Her newborn child had died miserably under the sharp teeth of the hyenas. Now, she had died too, but they did not know who the enemy was.

As her king, he did not seem to have done anything.

Blue's family of four returned with two strong deer.

The three warthogs and Little Mi walked over.

The cute violent bear and her son, who were hunting not far away, also came after hearing the news.

A few minutes later, Mixed Fur and Blue Eyes rushed back with the two gazelles.

When they saw this miserable scene, they were stunned on the spot and perfectly silent.

Before Chu Xiaoye left, he instructed the female lions to stay together and not run around.

However, hunger made them unable to wait. They were already used to hunting by themselves. Therefore, they could not help but spread out and search the surrounding forest for prey. Because of that, they paid a heavy price.

Blue Eyes threw the prey on the ground and walked forward to check the wounds on the lioness, Callie, with a grave expression.

Although the female lions had left the camp, they did not walk too far. The Jerry brothers and the other female lions were nearby and could run over to save them at any time.

However, this tragedy still happened.

The enemy was very fast and their movements were very fierce and sharp. Every move was almost fatal. Furthermore, they seemed to hate this lioness very much. After smashing her skull and breaking her neck, they actually wanted to open her stomach.

Could it be that he was an enemy who had a deep hatred for the pride?

However, who could have such terrifying strength and methods?

To be able to suddenly kill this lioness and retreat without alarming the other members, this enemy could not be underestimated\!

Blue Eyes looked at Maya.

Maya's face was covered in blood and she had a deep wound on her face. She was still trembling all over. Clearly, she had seen the enemy just now.

However, how should she describe it?

The Jerry brothers returned dejectedly.

They had lost the scent. They chased all the way, but they did not discover any traces of the enemy.

Now, not only were the enemies strong, they were also extremely familiar with this forest.

At this moment, there was a sudden noise in the forest beside him.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others back with two strong giant wild cows.

Little Curly Tail opened his mouth and was about to roar excitedly when his expression suddenly froze. He realized that the atmosphere was wrong. Furthermore, there was a strong smell of blood floating in the air.
