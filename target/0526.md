Chapter 526: The Queen's Jade Bracelet

The night wind was cold and the horses ran.

The orcs who were guarding outside the snow forest had already rushed in fear when they heard the news of discovering the Elven Queen, leaving a gap.

Chu Xiaoye and the others rode out of this gap under the night.

After entering the continuous forest, they finally escaped the encirclement of the orcs.

At this moment, everyone felt extremely tired.

The exhaustion of their strength and spirit made their bodies unable to take it.

Here were high mountains and steep mountains. The orc army could not chase here for the time being.

Perhaps the orcs thought that they had fallen off the cliff or that the winged dragons had brought them back to the fairy city.

After the previous annihilation, before the army arrived, the current orcs would never dare to act rashly against the City of Elves again.

At this moment, the night had already retreated.

The sun soon rose.

The rumbling of a waterfall suddenly came from the valley ahead.

The few of them followed the voice and rode over.

The battle last night had covered them in blood and they were still wearing orc's clothes outside. Everyone felt terrible.

"I'll take a shower and rest for a while before continuing on my way."

Chu Xiaoye rode his horse to the waterfall. Seeing a pool of water and a clear stream below, he hurriedly got down from the horse and rushed to the pool. He lay there and drank a few mouthfuls of water.

He was really tired last night and almost lost his life.

Now, he felt very happy drinking water and sunbathing.

Lanisi and the others also walked over and squatted by the pool. They held the water in the pool with their hands and drank it very elegantly.

They looked exhausted.

When they set off, not only did they bring water, they also brought food. However, when they fled last night, they left everything behind.

"Go away first. I'll take a shower."

Chu Xiaoye took off the orc leather coat on him and pulled off the orc hair on his head. Then, he said to the few female elves.

He sounded like he was giving orders, like last night.

Lanisi also pulled off the orc hair on her head. As she took off the orc leather coat outside, she smiled and said, "We've seen it anyway. What are you afraid of?"

Fei'er giggled. "That's right, Lord Night. Just take it off. We're not outsiders."

Lanisi took off the orc's clothes and blinked at him. "Night, we can even shower together."

Look, what had the once noble, proud, and self-respecting queen become?

Chu Xiaoye was afraid of her and walked towards the stream below.

Catherine followed behind him and looked back at the elven girls. She rolled her eyes, as if she was saying, "Shameless."

"Plop\!"

Hiding behind a rock, Chu Xiaoye took off his clothes and jumped down. He immediately felt comfortable, so comfortable that every cell in his body was moaning.

"Plop\!"

Water splashed everywhere and Catherine jumped down.

The little lioness did not seem to like water. At this moment, she came down to join in the fun.

Chu Xiaoye did not avoid her and only reminded her, "Catherine, stay away from me. Don't swim here after diving and be careful of your claws."

Although his claws were very powerful, he was also quite traumatized by the lioness cub's claws. Almost every time she fought an enemy, she would open their stomach. Her cruelty and ruthlessness made him sweat.

Didn't he see that the cold father's stomach trembled every time he saw this female cub?

Catherine looked at him resentfully and fluttered near the shore, not approaching him.

Soon, the sound of water splashing and the laughter of the elf girls came from the pool above.

Even the silent Denise took off her clothes and went into the water.

Chu Xiaoye rubbed his body for a while and plunged into the water again. He washed his short silver hair and felt that he had not drunk enough just now. He opened his mouth to drink a few more mouthfuls, then suddenly felt an urge to pee attack and peed out.

However, when he popped out from the water, his expression suddenly changed. He thought of something and hurriedly shouted up, "Your Majesty, please don't pee in the water."

They had held it in for the entire night last night. Now that they had suddenly entered the water, they must be full of urine. Furthermore, they were swimming upstream. As he washed himself, the stream washed over with urine.

Unexpectedly, once he said that, laughter immediately sounded from above. No one knew who was laughing.

Lanisi laughed and said loudly, "Night, we're not that bad."

However, Fei'er, who was beside her, suddenly blushed and looked embarrassed.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and happened to see her long pink hair and snow-white shoulders. The tallest Denise was even more striking. Not only did she show her fair shoulders, even her chest was revealed.

"Night\! You're peeping\!"

Lanisi suddenly shouted, as if she had caught a thief.

Then, Denise sank.

Fei'er still stood there with her face red. She giggled and said, "Lord Night, you can come over."

Vilis only revealed her head and said angrily, "Bastard\! You're not allowed to peep\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with them. After washing for a while, he swam to the shore and took down the clothes on the shore, placing them in the stream to wash.

His clothes were covered in the blood of Orcs. If he did not wash them, they would definitely stink and he would feel exceptionally uncomfortable wearing them.

A few female elves also took down their clothes from the shore and rubbed them in the water.

Fei'er said loudly, "Lord Night, the clothes I brought for you are still here. You can throw away that shirt. When you're done bathing, I'll go get your clothes."

When Chu Xiaoye heard this, he immediately threw away the clothes in his hand and let them drift away with the stream.

The blood on them could not be washed clean at all. She should have said so earlier.

After a while, Chu Xiaoye shouted, "Fei'er, bring me my clothes."

"Alright, please wait a moment, Lord Night."

Fei'er replied.

However, a few seconds later, the girl suddenly cried out in alarm, "Oh no\! Lord Night, your clothes are gone\!"

Chu Xiaoye: "???"

"Sorry, Lord Night. I thought that I did not leave your clothes behind. What should we do now?"

Fei'er blamed herself.

Yes, what should he do now?

Chu Xiaoye was completely dumbfounded as he soaked in the water.

The clothes from just now had already drifted away with the stream. And he did not have any other clothes now. He could not become a lion for the time being. He was completely naked. Could it be that he had to ride a horse while naked?

He did not care, but the horse was definitely unwilling.

"Fei'er\! Are you doing this on purpose?"

Chu Xiaoye said gloomily.

Last night, when he was facing the ferocious orcs, he was not afraid of danger and was smart. Now, he was really panicking. No matter how smart he was, he could not make a shirt.

"Lord Night, sorry, sorryâ€¦"

Fei'er apologized profusely, sounding like she was about to cry.

Chu Xiaoye could not bear to blame her again. Last night, this little girl was not afraid at all and rushed out of the cave with him without hesitation. She pretended to be a queen and lured away those terrifying orcs. Be it courage or loyalty, he admired her very much.

"Forget it. tear off a piece of your dress and bring it to me. It'll be enough if you can wrap my lower body."

Chu Xiaoye sighed and said softly.

"Pfft\!"

At this moment, Fei'er laughed and said, "Lord Night, why don't you wear my dress?"

As she spoke, the pink-haired girl suddenly jumped out from behind the rock. She was holding a red dress and looked at him with a smile.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the dress in her hand in a daze, then at the brand new pink dress she was wearing. He said, "Fei'er, why does this dress on you seem to not be the one from last night?"

Didn't they lose all their clothes?

Fei'er grinned and placed the red dress in her hand on the shore. She squatted on the shore and blinked her clear and beautiful big eyes at him. "Lord Night, I still have many clothes there. Your Majesty, Lady Vilis, and Denise still have many clothes. Only your clothes fell. Lord Night is really unlucky."

"Yes, Night, you're really unlucky."

Queen Lanisi also came and changed into a purple dress, looking at him with a smile.

Then, the huge sword loli also changed into a brand new silver tight leather shirt. She looked at her huge sword and walked over, saying with a mocking expression, "Fei'er's dress is very nice and suits you. Put it on, our Lord Night."

If Chu Xiaoye still did not understand, he would be an idiot.

It seemed that these little elves were playing him again\!

"Fei'er, where are my clothes? You still have so many clothes. You definitely haven't lost my clothes either. Take them out\!"

Chu Xiaoye crawled on the shore and extended his hand. However, he felt that the threat was not enough and grabbed Fei'er's pink skirt.

Fei'er giggled and said coquettishly, "Lord Night, try wearing Fei'er's dress. It will definitely look good."

Good looking my ass\!

Chu Xiaoye looked angry and grabbed another strand of pink hair on her chest. He said angrily, "You're more than 1.7 meters tall and I'm only 1.4 meters tall. If I wear this dress of yours, I won't even have a shadow of my head\! Quickly bring me my clothes\!"

Fei'er squatted on the shore and lowered her body, as if she was deliberately letting him hold her. She shook her head and said, "No, Lord Night. Unless you promise us that when we return this time, you will marry Her Majesty. Otherwise, you can only wear Fei'er's dress."

"Ah\!"

Just as she finished speaking, Chu Xiaoye suddenly used his strength and pulled her down from the shore.

"Plop\!"

Fei'er was caught off guard. She cried out in fear and fell into the water.

Before she could sink, Chu Xiaoye grabbed her collar and lifted her up. He sneered and said, "Fei'er, why don't Lord Night strip you naked and make you travel with me while naked?"

Fei'er wiped the water on her face and cried, "Lord Night, please spare me. The clothes are not with Fei'er and are with Her Majesty. Fei'er was forced."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the Queen.

It was indeed this honorable queen's scheme\!

Lanisi hurriedly took a few steps back and said with a smile, "Night, if you don't agree, I won't give it to you. Fei'er is a pure and good girl. If you strip her naked, you'll definitely marry her. At that time, you'll have to marry two at once."

Fei'er hurriedly said in the water, "Lord Night, please strip me naked immediately. I won't resist, please\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere and Chu Xiaoye threw her up.

"Your Majesty, bring the clothes over and stop messing around. This is not the time to play. Furthermore, I have a very important thing to tell you. It concerns whether this mission will succeed."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly said with a serious expression.

The smile on Lanisi's face immediately disappeared and her expression became grave.

She raised her right hand and her sleeve slid down, revealing her slender and white wrist and a jade bracelet on her wrist. Then, she used her slender fingers to pinch the corner of the shirt revealed on the jade bracelet and slowly pulled it out. Soon, she pulled out a brand new male outfit.

"Night, this shirt was specially made for you. It's very fitting. Try it on."

Lanisi placed her clothes on the shore and said softly.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at the dress but looked at her wrist in shock.

Lanisi smiled, pulled open her sleeve, and extended her fair wrist in front of him. "This jade bracelet was passed down from our elven ancestors. It can store many clothes. There's only one in the entire Elven Kingdom. Isn't it magical? When I first saw it, I was shocked too. It's the same expression as your current expression. I couldn't understand it at all. Only Nalia was not surprised at that time."

Chu Xiaoye suddenly looked at her and said, "Your Majesty, when you were retrieving the clothes just now, did you chant something or use some power?"

Lanisi was stunned for a moment before she shook her head. "No, I just thought of taking your clothes. Then, your clothes were revealed from here. I pulled them and they came out."

Chu Xiaoye was really shocked.

When they told him that the world outside and all creatures were shadows of this world, he did not believe them. Until now, when he saw this jade bracelet, he still had doubts.

After all, the humans outside were so smart and had the symbols of many civilizations and advanced technology. The world here could not compare to them.

However, after seeing this magical jade bracelet, he suddenly believed it.

The technology outside could not use such a divine power so easily.

Perhaps the outside world was really just a shadow of this world, but the direction of development was different. It was possible that the world here had done an experiment to let it develop in another direction.

Unexpectedly, when it developed to its peak, it broke the rules and damaged the structure of that world. In the end, it was facing the risk of collapse and destruction.

"Your Majesty, can I take something out?"

Chu Xiaoye was very curious and was eager to try.

Lanisi shook her head and said, "No, only the purest bloodline of our royal family can do it. Annie and Nalia can do it."

Chu Xiaoye was secretly shocked. This was actually like a legendary magical weapon.

"Your Majesty, go away first. I want to get up and wear clothes."

He decided to study it after coming ashore.

If he figured out the origins and principles of this thing, he might open a new world door.

"Night, you just said that you have something very important to tell me, right? Can you tell me quickly?"

Lanisi said anxiously.

Chu Xiaoye grabbed the clothes on the shore and looked at her. "Your Majesty, I just want to ask you if you like to eat farts? This is very important to you and me."

Lanisi:"â€¦"
