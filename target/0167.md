Chapter 167: His Territory

"Roar\!"

The intense pain made the black-haired lion suddenly let out a scream. Its head tilted and it fell to the ground again.

Blood sprayed out of his mouth and his chin fell to his chest.

This time.

His vision turned black and he fainted\!

His miserable scream also frightened the two lions on the other side who were still biting the Chino brothers.

When they turned around and saw this terrifying scene, they were shocked beyond compare. Their remaining fighting spirit immediately turned to nothingness.

The Chino brothers took this opportunity to pounce on them and bite them ferociously.

The jackal couple, who had been helping the Chino brothers harass the two lions, immediately pounced on them and bit their thighs.

The two lions no longer had any fighting spirit. They hurriedly jumped up, turned around, and ran\!

The Chino brothers and the jackal couple immediately increased their courage and roared as they continued to chase after them.

They were defeated.

When the three female lions saw this scene, they did not dare to stay any longer and immediately fled in panic. They were even more miserable and terrified than when they fled last night.

Chu Xiaoye did not chase after him.

He raised his head and looked at the grassland in the bright sun.

From today onwards, this forest and the surrounding twenty kilometers of grassland would belong to him\!

He was not greedy.

However, he knew that this pride would not let the matter rest.

He knew that if he wanted to really have this territory, he had to defeat the true lion king of this territory and make all the members of this pride submit\!

The battle was not over.

Perhaps today, perhaps tomorrow, or soon, another more dangerous battle would arrive.

He would wait for them here.

The black-haired lion could not survive.

Blood flowed from his mouth continuously.

He would die quietly in his coma.

There was no pain or despair. Everything happened so suddenly. This strong lion ended his life without any warning.

This was good.

At least he died in a heroic battle, not like many lions who gradually grew old and were expelled from the pride. They would be alone and die under the claws of other carnivores.

If such a day came for Chu Xiaoye, he would rather die in battle.

The smell of blood from the black-haired lion quickly filled the air in the cool morning breeze. It drifted into the bushes and into the distant grassland.

In the bushes, the carnivores that saw this battle were all terrified. Naturally, they would not come out to die for this corpse.

However, the vultures in the sky came after hearing the news.

They circled in the sky, hesitated, and cowered. In the end, they finally landed.

This was the cleaners on the grassland, the free labor.

Chu Xiaoye walked away and let them work.

However, he did not welcome some cleaners.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas that were paying attention to the movements of the vultures immediately heard the news and ran over majestically from the distant grassland.

Although they were mostly cut off from the territory of the pride, the territory of the pride was too big to patrol at every moment. Therefore, they often took the opportunity to barge in and eat their fill.

Enemies would not be polite\!

More than thirty spotted hyenas ran over greedily under the lead of a tall and strong female hyena.

They saw the excited vultures, smelled the strong smell of flesh, and saw Chu Xiaoye, who was standing not far away.

However, they did not hesitate.

Under the lead of the hyena queen, they were lined up neatly and moved their limbs comically, looking like a well-trained army that was aggressive\!

At this moment, the Chino brothers and the jackal couple rushed back.

When they saw the huge hyena pack, their originally pleased and excited mood immediately sank.

They hated these despicable hyenas\!

"Roarâ€”"

The Chino brothers, who had the might of victory, immediately let out angry roars. They hoped that this group of thieves would scram quickly\!

However, not only were the hyenas not frightened by their roars, they suddenly stopped and looked at them provocatively and coldly.

The corpse of a lion was definitely not enough for them to share.

As for the Chino brothers, not only were they injured, they were also much smaller than the lions here. They looked to have trash strength and were easy to deal with.

Therefore, the hyenas immediately targeted them.

When the Chino brothers saw this scene, they prepared to roar again but stopped abruptly.

They no longer had any combat strength.

Furthermore, this was a strong and united hyena army\!

The hyena queen brought the female hyenas and walked towards the corpse of the black-haired lion.

The other hyenas surrounded the Chino brothers.

As for the jackal couple, they had long fled when they saw that the situation was bad.

The hyenas were not interested in them.

The Chino brothers immediately leaned their butts and bared their fangs, looking at this group of despicable people in fear.

If they had the ability to fight one-on-one, what was the use of fighting in groups?

The vultures that were surrounding the black-haired lion and pecking at its flesh were immediately sent flying by the hyena queen that had rushed over and landed not far away.

The hyena queen brought the three female hyenas and quickly ran to the black-haired lion's side to eat.

They were the highest-ranking members of this tribe, so they were naturally qualified to enjoy the food first.

However, they seemed to have forgotten about the young lion standing not far away.

Perhaps, they did not forget but did not care at all.

A lion that did not even have a mane was not worthy of their attention.

Therefore, they immediately wolfed down the corpse of the black-haired lion.

Chino's roar was filled with fear.

The two brothers looked at Chu Xiaoye for help.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not go over.

He stared at the tall and strong hyena queen for a few times before walking over.

If he wanted to survive in this territory, he had to let these neighbors, enemies, and competitors know the true strength of the owner of this territory\!

This hyena pack was indeed strong.

However, they should not have entered his territory so brazenly and eaten his spoils of war in front of him. Furthermore, they were preparing to eat his subordinates.

If he could tolerate this, he would not be a lion king in the future.

He might as well be a coward.

He did not roar, run, or show any embarrassment or anger. He only walked over as if he was pacing.

For some reason, his feet would heat up every time he saw these hyenas.

His strength also seemed to be growing stronger.

His "hand" was so hot and itchy.
