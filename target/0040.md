Chapter 40: Selfish

The lion was hungry.

Victory could not fill one's stomach.

However, it could chase away the enemies and allow the lions to have the food and resources of this territory all to themselves.

The female lions brought the four young cubs to the distant gnu herd.

If that herd stayed in this grassland forever, they would have fresh meat to eat every day.

This was a very happy thing.

However, this was not realistic.

Therefore, while the vegetation had yet to completely wither and the gnus were still around, they had to take the time to live a few more days of bliss.

Aisha brought the three female lions and quietly approached the herd.

The pregnant Callie hid in the distance with the four young cubs and watched.

The cubs were learning the hunting skills of female lions to build a good foundation for their future survival.

As for Callie, she was lying motionless with her neck raised, paying attention to the movements of the gnus.

If the gnus were frightened and all ran towards them, she would immediately escape with the four young cubs.

The iron hooves of a herd were no joke.

Once one fell into it, one would either die or be injured.

The lion hid further away and did not dare to approach, afraid that his lush mane and strong smell would be discovered by the gnus.

Of course, he was still guarding against his old enemies when he suddenly turned around.

The female lions started to sprint\!

The gnus were in chaos\!

Under the lead of the lead gnu, the gnus' hooves flew as thunderous sounds rumbled. Their momentum was vast as they charged forward bravely into the distance\!

Any animal that dared to stop them would be trampled into meat paste\!

However, the four female lions were in no hurry to pounce on them.

They ran behind the gnu herd. When they saw that the gnu at the back was gradually unable to keep up with the team, they immediately took action\!

Aisha suddenly rushed up and blocked the gnu from the front\!

The gnu that had fallen behind immediately panicked and was chased in another direction.

This increased the pace at which it was being hunted\!

The four female lions started to surround and chase\!

The gnus abandoned their companion and fled. Soon, they disappeared from the boundless grassland.

The gnu that was left behind used all its strength to flee in panic, its speed becoming faster and faster\!

Seeing that it was about to escape the encirclement, Xi'er, who was blind in one eye, suddenly rushed over from the side at an extremely fast speed. She jumped up and pounced on it bravely, biting the gnu's neck\!

However, the gnu was too fast. Its raised front leg suddenly kicked her abdomen\!

Xi'er's mouth loosened and she fell heavily to the ground.

The running gnu was also tripped by her rolling body on the ground.

Aisha, who had run close, immediately took this opportunity to pounce on it. She bit the gnu's mouth and blocked its nose\!

Maya and the lioness with a broken tail also quickly caught up\!

Maya pounced on the horned horse's back and bit its neck.

The lioness with a broken tail bit its hind leg and prevented it from standing up again\!

Xi'er, who was lying on the ground, panted heavily for a while before she got up in a sorry state and walked to the gnu's side. Her abdomen was heaving, and she seemed to be in so much pain that she had no strength to bite it.

When Chu Xiaoye saw this scene, he immediately ran over with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

Lars ran faster and more excitedly\!

Obviously, the prey had fallen to the ground, and he could go over and enjoy it\!

He was the big brother, so he should run and enjoy it first\!

The lion in the distance also ran towards its prey with its mane flying.

Soon.

The four young cubs ran to the side of the prey.

Lars did not stand on ceremony. He climbed directly onto the abdomen of the gnu and prepared to enjoy the feast.

At this moment, an angry roar suddenly sounded from behind\!

The lion, the cold father, ran over and suddenly slapped his head. He bared his fangs and let out a terrifying roar\!

The lion’s sharp claws cut Lars’ head and he jumped up in pain.

He hurriedly hid behind the lioness with a broken tail with his head lowered and cried out for mercy.

The lion looked at him coldly and then at the other lionesses.

Other than Aisha, who was biting the gnu's mouth, the other lionesses automatically retreated from the prey.

Xi'er walked to the grass not far away and lay on the ground with her mouth open, looking like she was in pain.

Mei Mei went to her side and rubbed her head.

The lion naturally laid down beside the abdomen of the prey and started to enjoy the fresh meal alone.

After the gnu stopped breathing, Aisha got up and left.

Be it lions, hyenas, or other animal groups, there were strict levels.

Those in power had priority.

Lars, who was standing behind the lioness with a broken tail, looked at his father's majestic and overbearing appearance with envy.

He believed that one day, when he grew up to be a true lion, he would also have such supreme authority and dominance\!

He envied his father.

But.

He was also filled with hatred for his father\!

The prey was caught by his mother and the other female lions. He did not do anything, so why did he have to eat it first? Furthermore, he had to eat the best parts?

This was his current thought.

Because he was at a disadvantage now, in a situation where he was bullied but could not resist.

When he became stronger in the future.

His father was his role model now\!

He wanted to become more impressive than his father\!

The lion ate very slowly and was very picky.

Although Lars and the female lions were drooling and hungry, they did not dare to take a step forward.

Xi'er lay on the ground, looking quite injured.

Chu Xiaoye walked to her side and looked at her abdomen carefully. Her internal organs were probably injured. He could not treat her and she could only recuperate by herself.

Over this period of time, she should not be able to go out to hunt anymore.

If not for her courage just now, this gnu would have already fled.

She had once lost an eye in order to hunt, and now, in order to hunt, she was seriously injured.

However, other than her daughter, who would care about her?

Every pride was the same.

When hunting, they would work together, fight side by side, and have a harmonious relationship. Once there was a lack of food and they enjoyed their prey, they would roar and fight for it, and they would even bite each other coldly and selfishly.

This puzzled many animal experts.

Actually, this was just like humans.

Usually, when there were no conflicts of interest, their relationship was very good. When there were conflicts of interest and disputes, their expressions would immediately change.

Humans did it for their benefits.

As for animals, they only wanted to live.

Therefore, to Chu Xiaoye, be it the cold and selfish lion or the other lionesses, there was nothing wrong with them.

After the lion finished eating, it got up and walked to the side.

Lars immediately ran up, snatched the best seat, and started eating.

The four female lions immediately ran over and competed to bite the prey.

Xi'er lay on the ground and struggled for a moment. She wanted to stand up, but in the end, she could not.

The intense pain in her abdomen made her body tremble slightly.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at her and walked towards the prey with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

"Roar\!"

He had just walked to Lars' side when this big brother turned around with his mouth full of blood. He bared his fangs at him and roared with a fierce expression.

He was the big brother, and the best seat was his\! No one could snatch it\!

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and suddenly slapped him on the head, staring at him coldly.

Lars was furious. He roared and jumped up, preparing to bite. Little Curly Tail suddenly pounced from behind and bit his neck\!

Not only was Lars shocked, the other lionesses were also shocked\!

It was just a fight between brothers. Was there a need to bite his neck and put him to death?

Little Curly Tail let out a hoarse roar. The fierce expression on his face was even more terrifying than Lars' earlier expression\!

Lars was instantly scared silly. He hurriedly lay on the ground, turned over, and exposed his abdomen to show his surrender.

He immediately cowered.
