Chapter 161: Fighting for His Dreams\!

"Whoosh\!"

When Chu Xiaoye surfaced, the little elephant was already lying on the shore dripping wet and trembling.

Obviously, it was terrified.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at the sparkling but deep and mysterious lake water. He did not dare to stay any longer. He immediately roared and urged the little elephant to get up and leave this place quickly.

The monster in the lake was no small matter.

If they had not been stuck in the dinosaur skeleton at the bottom of the lake, they would have seen Hades long ago.

The little elephant got up shakily and followed behind him.

This fellow had always been heartless and looked like he was not afraid of anything. Now, he was so scared that his legs turned limp and his entire body was trembling. It could be seen how terrifying the monster at the bottom of the lake was.

Of course.

It was also possible that it was frightened by the huge dinosaur skeleton.

Chu Xiaoye brought them away from the lake and walked towards the grassland.

Although the forces on the grassland were complicated and every one of them was strong, they were much safer than the lake and the forest.

Previously, he had been frightened by the hyenas and approached the forest. Now, he was frightened by the monsters in the lake and came to the grassland.

Thinking of it, he, the future lion king, was really embarrassed.

When they first came to the grassland, they were like stray dogs that were frightened and ran around.

The poor thought that with their wisdom and effort, as well as the various skills they trained in the world of the poor, they could be invincible in the world of the rich and achieve greatness.

In reality, it was just a joke.

No one thought highly of him.

The pride with three adult lions looked down on him.

The monsters in the lake looked down on him even more.

Even the hyenas that he had scared away looked at him disdainfully, as if they were looking at a slightly capable bumpkin.

They were different from him.

They were natives here and had the backing of a faction. They had their own territory and home, their companions and family.

They had a natural advantage.

As for him, other than an underage elephant, two unreliable lions, a burden that still needed milk, and two jackals, what else was there?

He did not even have claws.

The night was deep and the breeze was cool.

Chu Xiaoye's passion when he first came seemed to be splashed with cold water in front of these cruel reality and gradually turned cold.

With a lot on his mind, he bathed in the cold moonlight and walked alone on the vast grassland.

The grassland was vast and boundless.

However, where was he to stay?

Where could his dream of becoming a king be realized?

The distant sky revealed a hint of white.

The night finally passed.

Tomorrow would eventually come.

However, that light did not belong to him for the time being.

There was a swamp ahead.

When he brought the injured behind him close and prepared to rest here for a while, a black crocodile about three meters long suddenly got up from the mud and opened its mouth at him, showing its sharp fangs.

This was its territory\!

Its wide mouth and gaze at him seemed to be saying, "Where did this country bumpkin come from\! Scram\! Don't stay in my territory\!"

The other crocodiles in the mud also opened their mouths and bared their fangs, threatening fiercely.

The anger in Chu Xiaoye's stomach suddenly erupted\!

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly rushed over and slapped the crocodile's eyeball, causing its eyeball to explode with a bang\!

Blood splashed everywhere. The crocodile was so shocked by the sudden attack and pain that it almost jumped up.

Chu Xiaoye bit its head. His sharp teeth actually pierced through its skull with a crack\!

The crocodile twisted violently a few times before its body froze.

The other crocodiles that were watching in the mud immediately sank to the bottom of the pit with a whoosh and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye bit the crocodile's head and paused for a long time in place. Then, he loosened his teeth and raised his head to look at the distant grassland.

The Chino brothers and Doya, who were following behind, were silent.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at them. Then, he walked to the grass not far away and lay down.

He needed to recover his energy and stamina.

Tomorrow, he would continue to work hard for his dream\!

He had no background, no companions, and no claws. It was okay. He still had sharp teeth, speed, strength, and a lion's heart that would never surrender\!

The morning sun that belonged to him would still rise on this grassland\!

His sun would shine on every corner of this grassland\!

The crocodile's corpse was eaten by the Chino brothers, Doya, and the jackal couple.

After dawn.

Chu Xiaoye brought them towards the river that crossed the grassland.

The red morning sun hung on the horizon.

The grassland was extremely lively.

The gnus, water buffaloes, black antelopes, and other herbivores ate the tender green grass with dew happily under the bright and cool morning sun.

The huge grassland was divided into many territories by various carnivores.

When Chu Xiaoye brought this strange team and was about to pass by a group of gazelles, the cry of a wild dog suddenly sounded from the grass not far away.

Then, more than thirty wild dogs rushed out of the dense grass majestically and let out noisy and angry cries.

This was their territory\!

The prey in the territory was naturally theirs too\!

They would not allow any fellow to behave atrociously in their territory\!

They were not big, but their formation was neat and they were extremely united. Even if they saw two adult lions in this strange team, they did not have any fear.

They let out threatening cries.

They seemed to be shouting, "Get out\!"

However, before they could run close, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed over like an arrow\!

Now, even these wild dogs dared to bully him?

How ironic\!

When a tiger falls, it will be bullied by dogs\!

However, he was not a tiger\!

No one could bully him on this plain or in the forest\!

"Roar—"

His roar sounded on the grassland in the morning, like a loud and high horn that was filled with high fighting spirit\!

His eyes flickered with a cold light\!

His speed became faster and faster, like a storm under the sun\!

Hot blood was flowing in his body\!

He yearned to fight\!

"Whoosh —"

He was like a hurricane as he rushed into the wild dog pack\!

The neat pack of wild dogs was in chaos\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Before the wild dogs could open their mouths to bite, their vision turned black and they flew up\!

Before they could land, more wild dogs flew up.

When the Chino brothers ran over with the jackals, most of the wild dogs were already lying on the ground, unable to move.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he had already bitten the neck of the wild dog leader. He stood under the rising sun and emitted a dazzling light.

The remaining wild dogs seemed to have been scared silly and stood at the side in a daze. They did not dare to go forward, retreat, or move.

The noisy and arrogant cries stopped at this moment.

The battle only lasted for a few minutes.

When Chu Xiaoye let go of the wild dog leader's neck and put down its corpse, the other wild dogs still stood in place, not knowing what to do.

When Chu Xiaoye left slowly, the wild dog standing in front hurriedly made way. It even lowered its tail.

They stopped screaming for him to "get out".

Chu Xiaoye licked the blood at the corner of his mouth and continued forward under the bright sun.

The Chino brothers and the jackal couple looked at him in a daze. Then, they lowered their heads and immediately followed behind him.

Doya sat on the back of the little elephant and narrowed her eyes. For the first time, she felt the beauty of the grassland.

They did not walk far.

They encountered two hungry wandering lions.

There was a lot of food on the grassland, but most of it was in the territory of other prides.

Ordinary wandering lions would not risk their lives to trespass the territory of prides to hunt.

Even if they hunted food, they could not eat it, let alone bring it away.

Therefore, when the two wandering lions saw that there was no herd protecting the little elephant, they immediately ran over.

Then, they looked at the Chino brothers.

Because in this team, only the Chino brothers could threaten them a little.

They were about three to four years old. The manes on their necks had already grown, but they were not dense and their colors were not too deep. Compared to a true adult lion, they were still much weaker.

However, they were born in this rich land and inherited the good genes of their seniors.

They were tall and strong, and the muscles on their limbs and shoulders bulged slightly. They looked taller, stronger, and heavier than the Chino brothers.

Their combat experience was also rather abundant.

The lions born here had to train their combat skills with their parents since young. Furthermore, they often competed with their neighbors' pride or the younger generation of other prides.

Therefore, their strength was definitely not something that these two foreign lions could compare to.

Foreign lions were generally smaller and weaker than them. Here, they were only worthy of being low-class lions.

Therefore, they did not take the Chino brothers seriously at all.

As for the other members of this team, they were not even interested in looking at them.

They did not roar, nor did they bare their fangs to demonstrate their might, nor did they do anything fierce.

Because those actions were the actions of the weak feeling guilty.

They only stopped in front of this team and looked at them disdainfully and coldly, as if they were looking at a group of herbivores that could eat at any time.

They believed that with their strong bodies and their natural aura of lions, these country bumpkins that had come out of nowhere would definitely be terrified to the point their limbs went limp and they peed their pants.

They had seen many foreign breeds. They were so timid and incompetent, weak and crippled. They were not worthy of being called lions\!

They raised their chins like high and mighty lions and looked at the Chino brothers with arrogance and disdain.

Indeed, the Chino brothers' limbs started to tremble and their eyes were filled with fear.
