Chapter 583: The Hunter's Ending

Running in the darkness\!

The wind howled in his ears, the gunshots became further and further away, and the light became more and more blurry. In the end, peace finally returned.

The humans gave up on chasing.

Chu Xiaoye brought the wild beasts that had escaped the cage and ran to the distant grassland. He communicated with them one by one and asked them if they had seen Mei Mei and the cold father.

Although animals did not communicate as clearly as humans, they had their own language. One gaze and one action were all languages.

Furthermore, there were many lions among these beasts.

These hundred-over ferocious beasts were respectful and grateful to the huge and terrifying lion in front of them.

Many ferocious beasts crawled on the ground to show their submission.

However, they had never seen the cold father and Mei Mei.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was feeling disappointed, a strong rhinoceros walked over and told him that there was another village two kilometers away. The village there was better built and there was also a new zoo. Perhaps they would hear from there.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat and he decided to go there tomorrow night to take a look.

Soon, it would be dawn. They had to hide first.

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Right at this moment, gunshots came from the distant grassland in succession.

There were humans hunting again\!

Low roars immediately sounded from the ferocious beasts, their eyes filled with hatred and anger.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and looked at the distant darkness. He suddenly growled and ran forward.

Hence, all the ferocious beasts followed behind him.

The grassland was their home, and no one could destroy it\!

The gunshots were getting closer and closer, mixed with the rumbling of elephants.

When Chu Xiaoye's gaze pierced through the night and looked at the grassland in front of him, he realized that a group of hunters were holding guns and attacking a group of elephants.

The huge elephants fell into a pool of blood one after another. They did not escape, but formed a circle to protect the small elephant in the middle.

The humans grinned hideously and treated them as targets for shooting. There were also the excited cries of women among them.

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and rushed out with the furious ferocious beast pack\!

The roar was like thunder and the ground trembled\!

"What is it?"

The human hunter's expression changed and he realized that something was wrong.

"Go\! Go quickly\!"

They rode on their horses and hurriedly wanted to escape\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye shot out like lightning and suddenly jumped towards one of the hunters.

The hunter hurriedly raised the shotgun in his hand and shot. However, before he could pull the trigger, his entire head suddenly split into two\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The other hunters hurriedly raised their guns and shot.

Chu Xiaoye was huge and their aim was very accurate.

However, when the bullets hit Chu Xiaoye, they actually created a few sparks and slid away, flying elsewhere\!

A layer of black armor condensed on Chu Xiaoye's skin. The armor flickered with a cold luster and was even tougher and texture than before.

The few humans thought that they had hit the target and were about to raise their guns to shoot the other ferocious beasts when the hundred-over ferocious beasts had already surged up like a tide\!

"Roarâ€”"

"Roar\!"

In an instant, the seven to eight humans were submerged in the beast tide and torn to pieces\!

Chu Xiaoye rushed out at lightning speed and pounced at the human woman at the far side. He slashed down and cut her in half from behind\!

At this moment, he no longer had any hesitation or psychological burden.

The humans fell into a pool of blood. The furious ferocious beasts roared at the sky, venting their anger and hatred for these cruel species.

The remaining five elephants still formed a circle and looked nervously at this group of terrifying ferocious beasts.

Chu Xiaoye growled and left with them.

He pointed out the path for these ferocious beasts, the only path to hope.

However, these ferocious beasts did not leave.

They wanted to take revenge\!

They wanted to chase all the humans on the grassland out of here\! They wanted all the hunters to pay with their blood\!

When the sky was about to brighten, they hid in the bushes.

Although it was dry now, all the bushes had expanded and were very lush after the two rains of blood.

Even during the day, it would be difficult to discover them if they did not walk into the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye hid on a tall Baobab tree and hid between the dense leaves. As he rested, he observed the surroundings.

If humans approached, he would be the first to discover them.

In the evening, the five elephants followed their steps and joined their team.

His family was killed and left one after another, making this group of gentle elephants hate him.

When the sky was about to turn dark, another group of hunters came out to hunt.

Usually, at dusk, animals would appear the most frequently. They chose this time to come out and naturally wanted to kill more animals.

They saw the five elephants eating leaves at the edge of the bushes from afar.

The eight humans immediately urged their horses over excitedly, and three of them were women.

The three women had white skin and bright clothes. They were even more excited than the men. Clearly, they had come from a big city and it was their first time coming out to hunt.

"Oh\! God\! What a big elephant\!"

"Peter, will they suddenly rush over and attack us?"

"Frank, I want an ivory\!"

The three women were excited and nervous. They had already started to aim their guns properly.

The five men taught them how to aim and shoot from the side.

"It's best to aim at the heads of those animals and kill them with one shot\!"

"Don't be afraid, we're here. Just shoot. If those animals dare to charge over, our guns will definitely make their heads bloom\!"

The eight humans approached with their guns.

As for the five elephants, they leaned against each other and looked at them calmly with benevolence.

No matter when, the expressions on these big fellows' faces were so friendly.

Just because of the two teeth in their mouths, they were in danger of being exterminated.

"Aim\! Fire\!"

A man encouraged.

But soon, he widened his eyes and froze on the horse.

The three women and the other men also widened their eyes and looked at the bushes with the same expression as him.

A huge lion covered in golden fur walked out of the bushes and stood in front of the five elephants, looking at them coldly.

Even if they did not roar, bare their fangs, or twist their ferocious faces, the terrifying aura of the ferocious beasts also made these human hunters' faces turn pale and they were terrified\!

"Whatâ€¦ What a big lion\!"

The eight humans were extremely shocked.

The three women trembled in fear and almost threw away the guns in their hands.

"What are you afraid of? We have money\!"

One of the golden-haired men sneered and raised the gun in his hand, aiming at the huge golden-haired lion.

"Bang\!"

He pulled the trigger.

Bullets flew out\!

However, the cold smile on his face suddenly froze.

The huge golden-haired lion was still standing there, looking at them coldly. It did not look injured\!

Could it be that he did not hit it?

The golden-haired man was stunned for a moment before he pulled the trigger again.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

He shot three times in a row, but the huge golden-haired lion still stood there motionless, not injured at all\!

At this moment, the golden-haired man and the others finally realized that something was wrong\!

"Go\! Go quickly\!"

The other men said quickly with changed expressions.

However, no one dared to move.

Because at this moment, more strong ferocious beasts walked out of the bushes.

In fact, their left, right, and back were already filled with ferocious beasts at some point in time.

The horses under them turned limp and fell to the ground.
