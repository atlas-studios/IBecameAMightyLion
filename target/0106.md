Chapter 106: The King of the Jungle

"Whoosh —"

The night wind blew and the vegetation swayed.

A tall tiger with colorful fur slowly walked out of the bushes.

It was calm and composed.

Its dark and cold eyes and the word "king" on its forehead made it look imposing and especially impressive\!

Even the lion, Seno, who had a lush mane, seemed so inferior in front of it at this moment.

It stopped outside the bushes and looked at Seno, who was baring his fangs and roaring with a trembling voice. Its cold gaze was filled with disdain.

Its calmness, composure, and arrogance formed a sharp contrast to the terrified and furious Seno. 

It seemed like it was the true king of this grassland\!

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail stared at the majestic big cat in front of him for a while before he suddenly called out to Chu Xiaoye.

He seemed to be saying, "Brother, brother\! What a big and mighty leopard\! Is he the father of that small female leopard?"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

Although they were all felines and were covered in patterns, and although they did look a little similar, how could this be the father of the little leopard?

No matter how big a leopard was, they would never be as big as a tiger.

My stupid brother.

When Little Curly Tail cried out, the tiger suddenly looked at him coldly.

Little Curly Tail could not help but tremble as he felt an invisible pressure and killing intent surge towards him.

"Roar—"

Mei Mei, who was standing beside him, bared her fangs, but her body was trembling.

Looking at this tall and mighty cat, she was inexplicably afraid.

"Roar—"

Catherine, who was protecting Chu Xiaoye, also roared and stared at it coldly.

As long as this big cat dared to come over, she would dare to pounce on it and dig out its intestines\!

Seno roared with a trembling voice. His body was trembling and his back was dripping with blood, but there were no wounds on his face. Clearly, he had been ambushed in the bushes and had run here in a panic.

Furthermore, his stomach was shriveled and his body was thin. He looked like he had not eaten for a long time.

At this moment, not only was he panicking and afraid, but he was also a little confused.

He had never seen an enemy who liked to attack like a leopard but was much larger and stronger than a leopard.

What was this?

Chu Xiaoye was also very nervous.

He stared at the colorful tiger and habitually wanted to flick his claws out, but he suddenly realized that he no longer had any claws.

However, he still had his fangs\!

The lion's trump card was still here\!

He bared his fangs and stared coldly at this foreign object.

At this moment, they seemed to have subconsciously abandoned their differences with Seno, who had trespassed their territory, and united against the outside world.

Because this fellow seemed to be a greater threat\!

The tiger looked at them coldly for a while but did not attack. Instead, it turned around and left slowly.

Seno was stunned for a moment. He did not expect it to retreat so easily.

Chu Xiaoye looked at its tall back and knew that it would definitely not let the matter rest.

Tigers had always been careful and liked to attack sneakily. They would not face their enemies head-on easily and would not fight while outnumbered, even if they had the strength to do so.

They always liked to attack suddenly and kill with one hit\!

He had once seen a video where someone placed a few wolfhounds in the garden where the tigers were locked.

The few wolfhounds had never seen a tiger before. They were ignorant and fearless. Furthermore, they relied on their numbers and strength to keep barking at the tiger.

The tiger kept retreating.

The wolfhounds were even more pleased with themselves when they saw this. They cried out loudly as they continued to threaten him.

The tiger retreated to a corner and did not even show its fangs.

However, the few wolfhounds still did not let up and continued to bark crazily. Their voices were very loud and they looked very fierce.

At this moment, the tiger that had been retreating suddenly jumped out and bit the neck of the closest wolfhound, pressing it to the ground. Its movements were terrifyingly fast\!

The wolfhound that was bitten could not resist at all and instantly lay on the ground motionless.

The other wolfhounds immediately dispersed and fled in fear when they saw this scene.

When the tiger let go of its teeth and slowly raised its head, the bitten wolfhound was already lying on the ground, dead.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye knew that the colorful tiger's retreat was not because it was weak, but because it was born careful, or rather, it was a strategy.

Now that there was a lack of food, there were few herbivores that could be caught in this patch of bushes. And this colorful tiger was hiding inside, so it might use the pride as a source of food\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the dark forest with worry.

From tonight onwards, he would never bring Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei in again.

Unless they could find out where the tiger was.

Otherwise, if it suddenly jumped out to attack while hiding in the dark, no one would be able to guard against it.

Furthermore, from its calm and composed expression just now, its intelligence could not be underestimated\!

This was a tiger with schemes and strength, and was exceptionally mysterious.

Unless it was his last resort, Chu Xiaoye would never provoke it.

The tiger retreated and Seno's situation was a little awkward.

Mei Mei and Catherine immediately turned around and looked at him covetously.

Seno ignored them and looked fearfully at Chu Xiaoye, then turned around and ran towards the hill.

He did not dare to return from the bushes. Instead, he prepared to take a detour back from the foot of the hill.

The sudden sneak attack just now made him feel lingering fear.

He was injured. If he encountered another ambush by that terrifying enemy in the bushes, it would be extremely dangerous.

Looking at the majestic lion leaving in a hurry, Chu Xiaoye felt that the grassland was starting to become restless.

Even a tiger had appeared. In the future, would more dangerous species that did not belong to this grassland appear?

It seemed that his path as a lion king would not be smooth.

After seeing that Seno had really left, Catherine immediately climbed up the Baobab tree, took a bag of water, and sealed the tree hole. Then, she picked up the water bag and climbed down.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei looked at the water bag filled with water in her mouth and immediately widened their eyes in shock.

They looked up at the Baobab tree they often slept on and were confused.

Where did the water come from?

They originally thought that only their brother could get water without anyone noticing. They did not expect that this foreign lioness cub could also get water.

Her brother must have told her secretly\!

Little Curly Tail felt wronged and resentful.

Not only did his brother give his love to Mei Mei, but he also gave it to this lioness cub. He, his younger brother, had less and less love left.

However, when he saw his brother's injured front and back legs, the scene of his brother flying to save him during the day immediately appeared in his mind.

Actually, his brother loved him more than anyone else.

His brother could risk his life for him\!

These two female lions could not compare to his place in his brother's heart\!

His brother had no claws.

It was okay\!

As long as he, Little Curly Tail, was here, he would fight anyone who dared to bully his brother in the future\!

In the future, no one could dream of snatching this king of the grassland from his brother\!

He, Little Curly Tail, would assist his brother and become a true king\!

Their brothers wanted to be invincible in the world\! They wanted to snatch all the beautiful female lions on the grassland\!
