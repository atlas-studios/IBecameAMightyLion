Chapter 85: He's Not Afraid\!

"Whoosh\!"

The two male hyenas almost had no chance to resist or dodge. Their bodies tilted and they fell into a pool of blood.

The hyenas were shocked\!

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked coldly at the male hyena that had just become king.

He recognized it at a glance\!

Baley looked at him in fear and suddenly let out a rapid and dignified cry.

It was ordering the hyenas to attack together\!

However, after seeing the terrifying strength of this cub, the other hyenas did not dare to go forward to die\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

They cried out and fled in all directions\!

The entire hyena pack was in chaos.

Before Baley could sit steadily on his throne, he was abandoned by this pack of terrified hyenas\!

He immediately took advantage of the chaos and fled towards the distant grassland\!

He was definitely not a match for this cub\!

This cub was about his size. However, be it its speed or strength, he could not compare to it.

What terrified him the most was the cub's right claw\!

Therefore, he did not hesitate and immediately fled in panic\!

He turned around and saw that the cub was not going to let him go. It actually chased after him\!

A malicious look appeared in Baley's eyes. He immediately changed directions and fled in another direction\!

That was the territory of the Seno brothers' pride\!

He did not believe that this cub dared to cross the borders of other prides alone\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

He continued to shout, calling for those idiots to follow him.

This would cause a greater commotion and allow the Seno brothers' pride to discover them sooner.

The pride could occasionally tolerate hyenas entering their territory, but they would never allow other lions to enter their territory.

Once discovered, they would either be expelled or hunted down without mercy\!

Hence, he felt that he was very smart.

No matter how powerful the cubs were, they would never dare to provoke those adult lions\!

Baley was very fast.

The ten-over male hyenas followed in panic.

However, Chu Xiaoye was even faster\!

He caught up to the ten-over male hyenas in the blink of an eye, but he did not attack. Instead, he passed them and chased after the male hyena that had bitten the cub to death\!

He only had one goal\!

He wanted to take revenge for his dead brothers and sisters\!

The night wind was hot and his blood was surging. The anger in his chest was burning like flames\!

While running, he suddenly felt that his left claw was starting to get hot.

He looked down and saw that the sharp tip of his claw had turned golden like his right claw\!

His speed was faster and the strength of his limbs was surging even more\!

"Whooshâ€”"

Like wind, like lightning, and like arrows\!

He flashed away\!

He quickly approached the male hyena\!

However, the hyena's speed and endurance were clearly extraordinary\!

It wagged its tail and ran as if it was flying\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and pounced behind him. His right claw flashed with golden light and he grabbed ferociously at its body\!

Just as it was about to grab it, the male hyena suddenly pounced forward and lay on the ground\!

It quickly rolled on the ground a few times, then suddenly jumped up and continued to run\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

It suddenly roared loudly.

Sharp and horrible sounds spread throughout the empty grassland and the quiet night.

It finally ran into the territory of the Seno brothers' pride\!

It suddenly stopped in its tracks and turned around, looking at the cub behind it coldly and cunningly.

Chu Xiaoye stopped.

He smelled the pungent smell of an adult lion.

Obviously, the male lion, Seno, had just marked the borders here tonight.

Regardless of whether it was a wandering lion or other prides, as long as they smelled this scent, they could not take another step forward.

Otherwise, it would be viewed as a provocation and invasion. They would be attacked by an adult lion, or even the entire pride\!

His lion instincts made Chu Xiaoye stop at the border.

Not far away, the roar of the lion, Seno, came from the grassland.

Baley stood in the territory of the Seno brothers' pride and opened his mouth, revealing his dense fangs, as if he was mocking him.

It also seemed to be saying: Kid, continue\! Why aren't you chasing anymore? Don't you want to take revenge for your dead younger brother? Come on\!

Baley was not afraid of that lion.

That was because the lion named Seno could not catch up to him.

In this hot weather, a lion wearing a thick mane coat was not willing to waste his energy chasing a hyena that was faster and more patient than him.

However, it would be different if it was a lion.

Regardless of whether you were a cub or an adult lion, as long as you invaded this territory, the king of this territory would attack with all his might and even kill you\!

Therefore, when he heard Seno's angry roar, Baley was not afraid at all. Instead, he became even more arrogant.

He looked provocatively at the cub in front of him and let out a strange sound, as if he was mocking it.

"Little thing, you haven't weaned off milk yet, right? Go back and drink milk\! Also, eat the corpses of your three brothers and sisters. They taste very good\!"

His scream was sharp and ear-piercing.

Seno's mane fluttered as he ran over angrily from the grassland not far away.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of the border and slowly closed his eyes, holding his breath.

Then, he suddenly opened his eyes. With a whoosh, he flew across the border like a bolt of lightning and pounced at the clamoring male hyena\!

Those amber eyes flickered with a cold and terrifying blood light in the night\!

Baley was shocked. He hurriedly jumped up from his spot, turned around, and wanted to flee in panic\!

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly streaked across his back\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped over his head and landed in front of him with his back facing him.

As for him, he stopped in place and stared without moving.

At this moment.

The furious Seno had already bared his fangs and roared as he charged over\!

Its flying mane and huge body seemed so terrifying and strong under the furious roars and sprints\!

The aura of the king of the grassland was vividly displayed at this moment\!

Not far away.

When Catherine, who had rushed over, saw this terrifying scene, she was so scared that her entire body trembled and her heart almost stopped beating\!

However, the adult lion with a murderous aura suddenly stopped in front of that figure and did not pounce on it.

Behind that figure.

The male hyena that was standing motionless in place suddenly spewed out a high blood arrow on its back\!

Then, its body suddenly split into two from back to front\!

They fell neatly to the ground\!

Fresh blood and internal organs splashed all over the ground.

It widened its eyes and died with a grievance\!

Catherine stood still as if she had suddenly gone stupid.

Seno, who was stopping in front of Chu Xiaoye, stopped roaring angrily\!

The night was very quiet.

A strong smell of blood filled the air.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the strong male lion in front of him and slowly raised his right claw.

An adult lion?

He was not afraid\!
