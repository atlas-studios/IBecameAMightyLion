Chapter 202: Water Monster

After dawn.

The rain stopped and the sky was blue.

When the sun rose, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine arrived at the foot of the snow mountain under the lead of the snow eagle.

The male leopard, Blue, followed behind.

From afar, this snow mountain was majestic and extremely tall. When it came close, it was even more shocking.

The peak of the towering mountain range rose and fell continuously. One after another, they were like the clouds in the sky. They were layered and looked magnificent.

Ordinary animals, even birds, would probably find it difficult to reach.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the foot of the mountain like an ant, so small that he was almost invisible.

On this side of the mountain, there was only a thin layer of ice and snow. On the other side of the mountain, there were silver glaciers.

Due to the obstruction of these huge mountains, the cold air that drifted over from the sea was all condensed on the other side of the mountain, causing the mountains and rivers there to be covered in silver and the land to be covered in ice all year round, becoming a world of ice and snow worthy of its name.

Chu Xiaoye had once seen such a magnificent scene on records.

On one side of the mountain range, everything withered and was lifeless. On the other side of the mountain range, rain and snow were endless and full of life.

The wonders of nature were all strange, magical, and beautiful. The lion was amazed.

The huge waterfall that seemed to have fallen from the sky in front of him, the rumbling was deafening and water flowed everywhere. It really flowed down three thousand feet, and it was like the milky way had fallen down the ninth heaven\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the silver stream had almost no end. The water that splashed up flickered with a colorful light under the morning sun, like beautiful fairies floating around and circling the mountain stream.

On the hill beside them, a beautiful snow deer was stopping to watch. When it saw Chu Xiaoye and the other two, it did not escape immediately.

The Snow Eagle's urging cry came from above.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to covet the beautiful scenery and immediately followed.

The snow mountain was too high to cross.

At the foot of the mountain, there was a river that passed through the mountains and formed a long, winding tunnel. The water was filled with reefs. The animals that went to the snow mountain all walked through the reefs from this deep tunnel.

When they reached the entrance of the tunnel, the snow eagle let out a cry and flew into the sky, leaving on its own.

It no longer needed to lead the way here.

After walking out of this tunnel, there would naturally be animals waiting outside.

Catherine saw that the shallow river water was extremely clear and was formed from snow. When she smelled it, it was extremely cool and sweet. She jumped onto a rock and could not help but lower her head to drink a mouthful. She felt extremely happy.

When she looked up, she realized that her king was standing on a rock in front of her. He was crossing his hind legs and peeing in the water.

"Chiâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye peed as he thought about something.

This tunnel was deep and long, and there was a river inside. There were probably many invisible dangers hidden inside.

They would naturally not be afraid if they went in groups.

They only had these three and were a temporary team. If they encountered danger, they might not even have a place to escape if they were in the water or in the hole.

However, this male leopard was clearly a frequent visitor to the snow mountain.

He should know the terrain and dangers inside very well.

Chu Xiaoye decided to let him lead the way.

Blue did not back down and walked in front.

Chu Xiaoye had saved his life a few times and his family of four lived in Chu Xiaoye's territory. He was equivalent to Chu Xiaoye's subordinate.

Catherine followed at the back and stuck out her tongue, pretending that nothing had happened.

After entering the tunnel, the light immediately dimmed.

The river was filled with black reefs. Blue jumped in front and walked. From time to time, water splashed and sounded exceptionally clear in the quiet tunnel.

Chu Xiaoye stepped on the reef he had passed and looked back at Catherine. Seeing that she was following closely, he relaxed.

The female cub jumped silently. He thought that something had secretly snatched it away.

After traveling for about ten kilometers, a strong smell of blood suddenly drifted over from the passageway in front of him.

Blue immediately slowed down and became vigilant.

Soon, a corpse appeared on the water. It was a female lion.

Blue knew this lioness.

Last night, he had seen this lioness beside the scar-faced lion king.

The pride of the scar-faced lion king walked in front, clearly having been ambushed by something.

Chu Xiaoye walked close and squatted in front of the lioness corpse. He observed carefully. There was a bloody hole in her abdomen and blood was still flowing out. Clearly, she had just died.

He extended his claws and flipped open the lioness's corpse. Just as he was about to observe if there were any other wounds, a fat mouse suddenly jumped out of the bloody hole that was flowing with blood and pounced at his face\!

"Bam\!"

Catherine, who was beside him, reacted extremely quickly. She swung her right claw and sent it flying heavily\!

The mouse fell into the water and splashed. It did not seem to be injured. With a whoosh, it actually jumped out of the clear water and instantly crawled into a cave at the bottom of the river not far away, disappearing.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked.

However, the wounds on this lioness's body were clearly not caused by the fat mouse.

He could not stay here for long.

Chu Xiaoye immediately got up and continued forward with the male leopard.

"Roarâ€”"

Suddenly, the roar of a lion came from the tunnel in front of him.

The river water splashed as the lion king's roar was especially loud and terrifying.

Obviously, they were fighting something\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately followed the male leopard and ran over quickly.

Amidst the splashing water, a lion and two female lions were wrapped by a few black and thick tentacles and dragged towards a cave at the bottom of the river.

They roared angrily and struggled with all their might, but they could not break free.

The scar-faced lion king and the other lions were dealing with the other tentacles in a hurry.

Because they were in the river, they could only land on the reefs. Their usual fighting techniques were useless here, and they could only bite and protect themselves in panic.

Once they fell into the water, they would be quickly wrapped by those slippery tentacles and dragged into the water.

Seeing that the three lions were about to sink into the water, the scar-faced lion king suddenly roared angrily. He slapped away the two tentacles in front of him and quickly jumped over to save them.

"Roar\!"

He suddenly bit the tentacle that was wrapped around the female lion and pierced it with his sharp fangs\!

The tentacle felt pain and immediately let go.

The female lion climbed up the reef in fear.

The scar-faced lion king immediately unleashed its might and pounced at the other two companions. Its sharp claws swung heavily and cut off the two thick tentacles\!

At this moment, all the tentacles started to retreat and quickly sank into the river, shrinking into the dark cave at the bottom of the river.

The scar-faced lion king did not dare to chase after him. He immediately jumped onto the reef and prepared to leave with the pride.

Suddenly, he saw Chu Xiaoye and the other two following behind. His dark eyes were filled with anger.

They led the way and killed the enemy, risking their lives, but these three easily followed behind without obstruction. As for the two little fellows among them, they were their enemies. How could they tolerate this?

Since the Snow Eagle messenger was not here, he could kill these two little things here\!

With this in mind, the scar-faced lion king immediately roared angrily and informed the other members to come and end the battle quickly.

Even if they bullied the weak with their numbers, who knew?

As long as these three died, this matter would be completely buried in this mountain\!
