Chapter 442: Giant Bird

The giant bird was actually three meters tall\!

The muscles on his two legs bulged and he was extremely strong. When he moved, his steps made the ground bang like muffled thunder\!

The most terrifying thing was its huge beak that occupied almost two-thirds of its head. It was like it was made of steel, thick, hard, and sharp like a knife\!

The tip of its beak that was curved like an eagle's mouth was vertical and extremely sharp. Perhaps any hard bone would be fragile in front of it\!

"Moas?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the ferocious giant bird in front of him and this word immediately surfaced in his mind, his heart filled with shock.

This ferocious bird that had long been extinct actually appeared here\!

The moa came ferociously and was very fast. He could not hesitate anymore.

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and assigned the pride to prepare for battle.

At this moment, it was useless to escape. Instead, the moa would catch up to them and peck their brains to pieces. The only way was to separate this terrifying moa and its pride and defeat them one by one.

Clearly, there was no lion king in this pride, and this moa was the king of this pride\!

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to think about why the moa would mix with the pride. He immediately brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly to welcome the charging moa.

Alisa followed.

Under the lead of Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur, the other members rushed towards the six lions and ten-over female lions.

Chu Xiaoye's plan was very simple. He wanted to attract the moa away and let Blue Eyes and the others kill the six lions first. Be it killing or chasing them away, they could do it.

Of course, it was best to kill him to prevent future trouble.

Then, they would deal with this moa together.

Otherwise, if they let this moa meet up with its pride, at that time, the moa would use its huge body, sharp beak, and strong legs to scatter their pride and chase them everywhere. The six lions would take the opportunity to kill them one by one.

At that time, no matter how powerful he was, he would be powerless to reverse the situation.

Therefore, he had to lure this moa away first.

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and rushed towards the moa that was running over ferociously\!

As he got closer and closer, he became more and more shocked\!

The moa's huge and strong body and ferocious appearance became clearer and clearer\!

Chu Xiaoye clearly remembered that the moa's most terrifying attack was to concentrate all its strength on the sharp tip of its beak and kill its prey in one move\!

No ferocious beast could resist the pecking force that was concentrated to a point\!

Like a sharp iron nail, he swung his hammer ferociously. If he was strong enough, he could pierce any hard bone\!

As for the moa, its three-meter tall body and strong muscles were clearly accumulating terrifying strength\!

Therefore, in ancient times, even wild beasts that were larger than moas often became delicious food for such ferocious birds.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and the others behind him and let them run separately. They only needed to lure this moa away and not face it head-on for the time being. If they were accidentally pecked, they would definitely die on the spot\!

"Whoosh\!"

When he was more than ten meters away from the moa, Chu Xiaoye suddenly accelerated and jumped over its feet. At the same time, his sharp golden claws grabbed past its strong left leg with a whoosh\!

However, these golden claws that could crush the bones of ferocious beasts and trees did not leave any wounds on the thick bird's leg. They only scratched off a few strands of strong leather armor.

The leather armor was not only hard but also very heavy. There seemed to be a special layer of fat inside. Even if the golden claws pierced through them, they would immediately slide away.

When Chu Xiaoye rushed to the moa's feet, the moa's sharp and terrifying beak also pecked down heavily. With a bang, it pierced into the soil on the ground, causing the ground to tremble.

Chu Xiaoye stopped behind it and let out a provocative roar.

The moa stopped in its tracks and turned around, glaring at him fiercely.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the others stood around Chu Xiaoye, roaring and provoking him.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and raised his head. He raised the leather armor he had just grabbed from its feet and provoked it in an even more arrogant manner.

The two stood together, one big and one small, forming a sharp contrast.

The moa suddenly raised its neck and let out a wild beast-like roar. It jumped and pounced at Chu Xiaoye. Its sharp and terrifying beak cut down heavily like an axe\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly jumped away and ran forward.

The moa missed and immediately strode forward with its two strong legs, roaring as it chased.

Little Curly Tail ran beside him and suddenly thought of the method his brother had thought of when he hunted giraffes with his brother\!

He immediately ran towards the moa's legs, swung his tail, and flew over with a whoosh. He wrapped it around the moa's left leg, trying to trip this fierce and violent monster.

However, he had underestimated the strength of this huge creature and its strong bird leg. Before he could exert strength, he was sent flying by the running moa\!

Little Curly Tail was shocked. He was in midair and wanted to let go of his tail, but he could not help it. Just as his entire body was about to be thrown in front of the moa and his bones or head would be smashed, a figure suddenly jumped up from the side and landed steadily on the moa's back as if it was flying. It raised its sharp claws and pierced into the moa's flesh\!

The moa was furious. It immediately stopped running and jumped up from the ground. Its thick and long neck suddenly twisted and its sharp and terrifying beak pecked fiercely at the figure on its back\!

Little Curly Tail fell to the ground in a sorry state. He immediately took the opportunity to let go of his tail and roll into the distance.

When Alisa, who was scratching the moa's back, saw the terrifying beak pecking over, she immediately jumped back and dodged it narrowly. Then, she jumped down from the moa's back.

"Bang\!"

The moa landed on the ground and was furious. It immediately turned around and chased after Alisa with its strong legs.

Chu Xiaoye immediately ran over with Little Curly Tail and the others.

The moa ran as if it was flying and caught up to Alisa, who was running quickly. However, it did not lower its head to peck with its sharp beak. Instead, it suddenly jumped up and stomped down heavily with its strong and heavy huge claws\!

However, right at this moment, Alisa, who was running forward quickly, suddenly stopped in her tracks. With a whoosh, she did not turn around and jumped back, dodging beautifully\!

"Boom\!"

The moa's huge claws stomped hard on the ground, but it missed.

Right at this moment, Catherine suddenly jumped up from behind. With a silver flash, she grabbed the tail of the moa\!
