Chapter 228: Despicable and cunning baddie

"Crack\!"

Another tree was broken by the male tiger\!

Chu Xiaoye carried the little white tiger and finally left the two big trees that were jumping back and forth. He jumped onto a big tree further away.

The male tiger roared and quickly chased after him.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and did not continue to jump. Instead, he lowered his head and looked at him provocatively, signaling him to come up and fight.

The male tiger jumped onto the tree with a whoosh.

However, just as he was halfway up, Chu Xiaoye carried the little white tiger and jumped out again, landing on another big tree at the side.

"Roar —"

The male tiger roared angrily and panted. It could only climb up the tree and run under another tree.

Then, Chu Xiaoye started to carry the little white tiger on his back and jump around these two trees, provoking him without restraint.

The male tiger was furious. It started to crazily dig out the tree trunk and slap the tree.

When he slapped the back of these two trees again, Chu Xiaoye carried the little white tiger and jumped onto a big tree further away.

At this moment, he placed the little white tiger on a branch and climbed to the waist of the tree. He lowered his head and roared at the male tiger whose limbs were trembling a little, wanting him to climb up extremely arrogantly.

"If you're a man, come up and fight to the death\!"

The male tiger had never been played and humiliated like this. It immediately jumped up and climbed up the tree with a whoosh.

However, before he could stop, a branch beside Chu Xiaoye suddenly fell with the snow with a crack and hit the male tiger's head.

Snowflakes splashed and the leaves swayed, blocking the male tiger's eyes.

When he raised his claws and pushed the branch away, a golden light flashed and a sharp claw suddenly appeared out of thin air and grabbed his head\!

Although the male tiger was exceptionally furious and exhausted, its reaction was still very fast.

He did not have the time to dodge and hurriedly let go of his claws. His huge body fell from the tree trunk with a whoosh\!

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye's claws brushed past his scalp and scratched off a layer of his skin, then grabbed fiercely at the tree trunk he had just laid on.

The entire tree trembled slightly from his slashes.

Although the male tiger fell to the ground in a sorry state, it narrowly avoided the tragedy of having its head broken.

He jumped up from the snow, his head covered in blood and his head burning with pain. He was shocked and afraid. If he had not reacted quickly, he would have almost died\!

This little lion was actually so cunning\!

He raised his head and looked at Chu Xiaoye on the tree, roaring angrily.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree trunk with a trace of blood on his golden claw, as if he was mocking him.

Although the male tiger wanted to tear him into pieces, he still had lingering fear after the sneak attack just now. He was vaguely afraid of the strength of this little lion on the tree and did not dare to go up easily.

The two sides looked at each other from the tree and below it, facing each other with a murderous aura.

"Roar —"

Not far away, the roars of another male tiger and the female tiger could be heard.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. The female tiger was already covered in blood and wounds. She looked like she could not last for long.

If the female tiger was killed and the male tiger came to meet up with this male tiger again, he and the little white tiger would all die here today.

Therefore, he had to hurry and end the battle quickly.

Now, this male tiger had already exhausted more than half its strength and its head was injured. Its anger was also aroused by him and its combat strength and intelligence were greatly reduced.

This was a good opportunity\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly slapped the tree trunk.

The tree swayed and the snow on the branches fell like a fairy scattering flowers.

The male tiger under the tree had just suffered a great loss. Seeing this scene, it did not dare to stay under the tree for long. It immediately retreated to prevent the snow that fell from the tree from blocking its vision.

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to jump down from the tree. He did not give him any chance to rest and pounced forward.

The male tiger finally waited for a chance to fight him. How could it let go? It immediately raised its upper body and slapped down with its huge claws\!

If he was hit by this claw, even an adult lion would be paralyzed on the spot and might even die.

Chu Xiaoye did not dodge. He raised his right claw and faced it.

"Bang\!"

Two claws, one big and one small, collided heavily\!

Chu Xiaoye flew out diagonally and fell miserably onto the snow. He struggled for a few times before getting up.

However, just as he got up, the male tiger had already rushed in front of him again and slapped him hard\!

To this heavyweight animal, the lethality of its claws was even more terrifying than the lethality of its claws tearing through skin.

Therefore, most of the time, they would not deliberately flick their claws.

Unless they were entangled in battle and could not use their strength better.

To lions or male tigers, strength was their most terrifying killer move. As for females with weaker strength, they could only rely on their agility and sharp claws.

Therefore, this male tiger had always relied on its huge foot and the terrifying strength in its body. He wanted to slap this little lion into pieces until he was unable to resist.

However, he ignored a problem.

This little lion did not show its claws and fought him head-on.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye was sent flying again and fell heavily onto the snow not far away.

He struggled to get up, but his body was a little shaky, as if he could not stand steadily.

Luo Mei, who was on the tree, let out an anxious and terrified roar. She wanted to summon her mother to help him, but her mother could not save herself now.

When the female tiger heard her daughter's cry, she turned around and looked at her, her eyes filled with helplessness and despair.

"Roar —"

The roar of the male tiger resounded through the forest\!

He pounced at Chu Xiaoye again.

This little lion seemed to be at the end of its flight. He could not let him escape up the tree again\!

"Bang\!"

He raised his huge claws again and slapped hard\!

Chu Xiaoye flew out for the third time.

This time, he flew even further and fell heavily on the snow. After rolling a few times, he stopped.

Then, he lay on the ground and twisted his body a few times, as if he wanted to struggle up. However, he could not stand up again.

"Roar —"

Luo Mei, who was on the tree, immediately roared angrily and rushed down from the tree without care.

The male tiger ignored her and came in front of Chu Xiaoye again. It looked mockingly at the arrogant little lion in front of it just now. It opened its mouth, bared its sharp fangs, and bit his neck, preparing to completely kill this little thing\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a pile of snow suddenly flew up from the ground and fell into his face and mouth.

At the same time, a golden light followed closely\!

The male tiger was shocked, but he was too close and could not dodge. He could only hurriedly shrink his head\!

"Chi\!"

Blood splashed out with the snow and landed on the ground.

The male tiger's entire lower jaw was actually cut off\!

He did not have the time to scream as he suddenly jumped back\!

However, the figure lying on the ground jumped up before his jaw could hit the ground\!

Just as he jumped up, the sharp golden claw suddenly pierced into his neck from below and up, like a sharp blade, slashing upwards\!

"Pfft—"

Blood sprayed out\!

His entire head suddenly hung down, almost falling between his legs\!

He fell heavily to the ground, and half of his neck was cut off. His lowered head was buried in the snow and he could not raise it again.

His body twitched violently and the blood on his neck surged out, but he did not die immediately.

His limbs were still shaking, as if he wanted to struggle up, but he no longer had any strength.

He tried his best to raise his head and look at the despicable and cunning little lion in front of him, but he realized that he had already lost control of his head.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of him and looked at him coldly. He ignored him and ran towards another male tiger with a whoosh.

Under the mother tiger's desperate fight, the male tiger was also seriously injured and its strength was almost exhausted.

Now was the time to send him off and let the brothers die together.

Luo Mei stood under the tree in a daze and watched as he ran past her at lightning speed, as if he treated her as air and did not see her at all.

She looked at the bloody corpse of the male tiger on the ground, then turned around and stared blankly at his back as he ran towards his mother.
