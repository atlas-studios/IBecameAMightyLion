Chapter 478: The Cold Father's Madness

Another three days passed.

Hunger and fear, frustration and despair spread throughout the entire cave and the hearts of every member.

His only rationality and pride were utterly defeated.

The smell of food came from outside.

They had never felt that this smell was so sweet and tempting, even when food was most scarce in the past.

It was time to make a decision.

Instead of hiding in this dark cave and starving to death, it was better to rush out and fight the enemy. Perhaps there was a chance of survival.

Even if he risked his life, he would die worthy.

It was better to sacrifice bravely in battle than to starve to death in cowardice, right?

The cold father was the first to be unable to tolerate it. His eyes were red as he roared angrily. He pushed Little Curly Tail away fiercely and rushed out crazily.

What welcomed him was not some delicious food or a hero's praise, but two bloody mouths that had just finished eating flesh\!

The cold father roared and pounced forward.

Hunger and despair made him fearless\!

He had risked his life\!

He bit the mouth of a lion\!

His neck was also bitten by another lion\!

The blood in his mouth excited him. He bit the lion's mouth tightly. Even if there was an intense pain on his neck and his breathing started to become irregular, he still did not let go\!

Mixed Fur, who was guarding the entrance, roared angrily and prepared to pounce out to help.

He was also too hungry to tolerate it.

Right at this moment, Little Curly Tail suddenly swung his tail and wrapped around the cold father's hind leg with a whoosh, dragging him in from the outside\!

The cold father was stuck at the entrance of the cave and was still biting the lion's mouth tightly\!

The lion that was biting his neck was caught off guard. Its head was dragged to the entrance of the cave and it hit the wall of the cave. Before it could let go, Mixed Fur's sharp claws suddenly extended and pierced into its eyes with a whoosh. He suddenly used strength and dragged it and the cold father into the cave\!

"Roarâ€”"

A miserable roar suddenly sounded at the entrance of the cave.

Mixed Fur bit the lion's head and two rows of sharp teeth instantly pierced the other party's skull\!

His brain exploded and blood flowed everywhere\!

The miserable lion immediately died\!

The lion that was bitten by the cold father was shocked and shocked when it saw this scene. It struggled with all its might, wanting to break free from the cold father's teeth, but it was useless.

The cold father suddenly used his strength and, with Little Curly Tail's help, actually dragged the lion into the cave.

Mixed Fur pounced on it again and killed it in one bite.

The lions outside were furious. They roared and rushed to the entrance of the cave. They bared their fangs and pretended to attack, but they saw that the two companions dragged into the cave had died miserably. They were terrified and did not dare to really enter.

Mixed Fur and Little Curly Tail continued to block the entrance of the cave and looked at them provocatively.

A low growl came from outside the cave. It was the roar of a lion king.

The furious lions immediately stopped and continued to guard the cave, waiting patiently.

In this situation of absolute victory, they actually lost two companions. To them, it was a humiliation.

However, no one had thought that the cold father would suddenly rush out and be so crazy.

They were too careless. There were two lions guarding outside the cave. The other lions were eating the fresh prey caught by the female lions not far away.

One learned from their mistakes.

This time, they arranged for more lions outside the cave to avoid the humiliation happening again.

The two lions that had been dragged into the cave had already turned into corpses with their eyes wide open.

Under normal circumstances, lions would not eat their own kind, but in a situation of lack of food and life and death, this situation would naturally change.

The fresh and strong smell of blood spread in the dark cave under the tree.

Every member unconsciously drooled and the hunger in their stomachs grew stronger.

The cold father's neck was dripping with blood, but he seemed to not feel any pain at all. He pounced at one of the lions and started biting.

Strictly speaking, these two lions were his spoils of war. Other than the lion king, he had the priority to enjoy them.

However, he could not care less now.

Maya, who was so hungry that she could not get up, was stimulated by the sweet smell of blood. She immediately walked over with the two weak cubs and started to whimper and bite.

Aisha and Xi'er walked over.

The other members swallowed their saliva and were hungry, but they did not forget their responsibility and continued to guard the entrance.

Little Curly Tail looked back and was about to growl as he distributed the food. Alisa had already walked over and bit the neck of one of the lions. Her sharp claws pierced into the corpse and quickly divided it.

Then, she brought the two halves of the flesh to the second and third holes and shared them with her hungry companions.

She did not take a bite herself.

Little Curly Tail looked at her with flickering eyes, then raised his head and looked at the tree hole above him.

His brother should have done this.

The more this situation was like this, the more he could capture the hearts of lions. Although everyone was loyal to their brother and had long admired him, this situation could not last forever because of their brother's negligence.

This time, everyone was already disappointed in their brother.

Little Curly Tail was worried, but he was helpless. He could not rely on him alone.

He clearly understood the gap between him and his brother. No matter how hard he worked, he could not compare to him.

The cold father was furious when he saw Alisa take away his prey and distribute it to the other members without permission, but he did not have the time to care.

He was too hungry and wolfed down his food. He did not have the time to care about anything else.

The two lions were very big and strong. Although they did not feed these hungry members, they temporarily delayed their deaths.

They regained their vitality.

However, how many more days could they last like this?

Even if they persisted for a few more days, so what?

In the end, wouldn't they starve to death or be torn to pieces?

A strange sound suddenly came from above the second hole. The soil started to fall, as if something was slapping the ground.

Little Curly Tail was shocked. He immediately roared and let the members behind him support him.

Outside the underground cave, under the super huge tree, a huge saber-toothed tiger was waving its huge claws and fiercely slapping the soft ground. Every slap made the cave tremble violently and soil fall.

The lion kings of the four prides stood respectfully not far away, not daring to approach. Their eyes were filled with fear.

It lasted until night and the muffled thunder stopped.

Although the underground cave did not collapse, a few cracks appeared on the entrance of the second cave. If these cracks expanded again, the entrance of the cave might suddenly collapse and expand.

At that time, the pride outside would rush up together and they could no longer use the advantage of the entrance to guard.

At this moment, Catherine, who was guarding the entrance of the tree hole, suddenly opened her eyes and looked back at the hole.
