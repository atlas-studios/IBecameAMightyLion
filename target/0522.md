Chapter 522: The Demon's Smelly fart

"Charge—"

The orc waved the weapon in his hand and roared as he wanted to rush in from the door of the prison.

In the end, with a bang, a terrifying black fog immediately filled the entire cell and quickly spread out\!

The orcs instantly felt their vision turn black and they lost their vision.

At the same time, a terrifying stench that could be called smelly suddenly crawled into their noses like a demon and entered their stomachs, starting to tear and roll\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

The fierce orcs suddenly bent down and vomited endlessly\!

"F\*ck\! It smells worse than my feces\! Ugh—"

The orcs at the front fainted from the terrifying stench. Before they could fall to the ground, their throats were pierced\!

However, not only were their mouths spraying blood, they were also spraying their stomachs' contents. Before they died, they were actually lying on the ground and vomiting non-stop\!

The entire cell was instantly submerged in black fog\!

More than 50 orcs and the descendant of the orcs named Loli fell into the rolling black fog and could not figure out where they were going.

"Guard the door and don't let them escape\! Ugh—"

Loli held her sword and screamed. Just as she finished shouting, she immediately bent down and vomited.

"Cover your nose\! Hold your breath\! Ugh—"

"Block the door, be careful of sneak attacks\! Ugh—"

The orcs, who had just been confident of victory, were in chaos. As they covered their noses and held their breaths, they waved their weapons randomly at the door of this cell. There were also orcs who ran to the heavy wooden door at the outermost side and guarded it, preventing the Elven Queen from escaping during the chaos.

In the cell, Lanisi covered her nose and hid in a corner, unable to tell where she was going.

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and guarded the door of the cell. His eyes flickered with a demonic light and he could clearly see the movements of the orcs outside.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly stabbed forward and pierced into the stomach of an orc.

The orc immediately let out a miserable scream. As he retreated in fear, he swung the big knife in his hand and cut the thigh of an orc beside him.

The orc cried out miserably and hurriedly swung the mace in his hand, roaring as he smashed it over, causing the brains of the orc hit by the sword to burst and he fell to the ground.

The other orcs also panicked and started to swing their weapons with all their might.

For a moment, the cell was filled with panicked roars and the cries of weapons waving.

However, they soon reacted and immediately held their breaths. They started to lean against the wall and the other prisons and retreat outwards. The weapons in their hands continued to swing in the narrow passageway, and they quickly retreated from the range of the black fog.

"Everyone, guard this place\! Don't let that smelly fart little bastard escape\!"

"Damn it\! When I catch that little bastard, I'll definitely use this spiked club to stab his anus\! Ugh—"

"Damn it, it's really smelly\! Could it be that a skunk was reincarnated?"

"Bullshit\! You're insulting a skunk\! A skunk's stench is not even a ten-thousandth of this little bastard's\! Ugh—"

The orcs stood outside the black smoke and cursed as they continued to vomit.

Fortunately, the ventilation conditions in this cell were good, and the black smoke did not continue to spread out.

However, it seemed that it would not dissipate for a while. Furthermore, there were still sounds of pfft coming from the cell.

"Damn it\! I suspect that the little bastard is made of smelly farts\! How can there be so many?"

"Damn it\! I have a shadow over all the elves now\! Ugh—"

Loli, who had retreated into the distance, shouted with a dark expression, "Guard the door and don't let anyone in\! I don't believe that his fart can last a day and night\! As long as we catch the Queen, we can definitely leave this place\!"

Indeed, a few minutes after she finished speaking, the black smoke that enveloped the prisons and corridors started to dissipate.

No more farts came from the cell.

"Hahahaha\! That little bastard is finally done farting\! Charge\!"

When the black smoke almost completely dispersed, the orcs immediately raised their weapons and rushed towards the cell, cursing endlessly\!

"Little bastard\! I want your life\!"

"I'll stab your anus\! You'll never be able to fart\!"

"Boom —"

Unexpectedly, just as they rushed to the door of the cell, a terrifying rumble suddenly came from inside again. Then, an even more terrifying black fog swept towards them like a hurricane, blowing until the faces of the few orcs at the front trembled and their hair fluttered\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

The murderous orcs immediately vomited and fled again\!

When they escaped the range of the black smoke, they vomited and cursed angrily.

Even the descendant of the orc and elf, Loli, could not help but curse.

As for the Elven Queen, Lanisi, who was hiding in the corner of the cell, she almost could not hold it in anymore. She wanted to breathe, but she was crying from the black smoke. She was so frightened that she did not dare to open her mouth. Her face was immediately red and she almost suffocated.

"Night, save me…"

She held her breath and closed her mouth tightly, letting out a weak and pitiful cry for help.

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and retreated to her side, blocking her face with his clothes. He said, "Your Majesty, cover your nose and breathe with your clothes."

Obviously, even now, he still did not know how smelly his fart was. Even if he used his clothes to cover it, he could not filter the terrifying black particles.

Those particles were like hundreds of millions of dense little bugs that were pervasive and drilled at every opening. How could mere clothes resist them?

The Queen covered her nose with her clothes and tried to breathe in fear. Her expression immediately changed drastically and her stomach churned. She almost vomited. Fortunately, she had experienced this before and hurriedly held her breath again, suppressing the urge to vomit.

"How could this fellow let out such a smelly fart?"

The Queen was also complaining in her heart.

"Damn it\! Why isn't that little bastard done yet?"

"Are they fucking sore losers?"

"How many years of feces did he eat to have so many smelly farts\!"

The orcs' curses shook the entire cell.

Right at this moment, hurried footsteps suddenly sounded outside the heavy wooden door. Then, they started to hit it with heavy objects.

"The elven guards are here\! Everyone, guard well\!"

Loli hurriedly brought more orcs and guarded the door. At the same time, she instructed the other orcs to continue thinking of ways to go over and catch the Queen.

Only by capturing the Queen could they take the Queen hostage and leave this place alive\!

"Everyone, take a deep breath first, then hold your breath and follow me in\! We must cut that little bastard into pieces\!"

One of the tall orcs cried out and immediately raised his weapon, charging in first.

Seeing that their companions were so brave, the elven guards outside were about to break in. They did not dare to hesitate and immediately roared angrily. They held their breaths and rushed into the black fog.

"Charge into the cell and kill that little bastard\!"

"It's best to cut his anus into pieces or block it with a mace to prevent him from spewing out more smelly farts before he dies\!"

"However, we can't see\! If we kill the Elven Queen, won't it be over?"

"Idiot\! We can't even tolerate that smelly fart changing the color of the sky, let alone that Elven Queen. I'm afraid that the little elf would have fainted and fallen to the ground\!"

"Right\! Let's just charge in and slash randomly. We can definitely cut that smelly little bastard into pieces\!"

"Charge\! Charge bravely\! For survival\! For the Elven Queen\! Charge\!"

"Boom —"

Just as they rushed to the door, another terrifying black fog sprayed over and pounced at their faces\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Damn it, I did not breathe at all. How can this fart enter by itself? This is not scientific\! Ugh—"

The orcs immediately bent down and started to vomit.

At this moment, something even more terrifying was happening in the cell.

Chu Xiaoye was molested.

What was even more terrifying was that he was naked.

Every time he farted, he would turn into a lion. Otherwise, he could not let out at all. However, every time he finished farting, he would immediately turn back into an elf, holding a sword and guarding the door.

At this moment, the Elven Queen, who could not hold her breath anymore, pulled him into her arms the moment he turned back into an elf. She returned to her domineering state and suddenly kissed him on the lips, causing him to be unable to breathe and his face to turn red.

"Charge\! Continue charging\! Kill that little bastard\!"

"We can't wait anymore\! It's just smelly farts\! We're not even afraid of death, why would we be afraid of mere smelly farts? Ugh—"

The orcs started to charge again.

Chu Xiaoye pushed the queen away, raised the sword in his hand, and stabbed at the door of the cell, stabbing into the eyes of the first orc.

"Ah —"

The orc cried out miserably. He opened his mouth and suddenly sucked in more black smoke. He sat on the ground and covered his eyes as he cried out and vomited.

The other orcs immediately swarmed over and surged into the cell.

Chu Xiaoye occupied the doorway and quickly stabbed with the sword in his hand. Every time, he could pierce accurately into the orc's body. Although the orcs were holding weapons, they could not see him.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his sword and slaughtered cruelly in the dense black fog.

The entrance of the cell was soon filled with Orc corpses.

The orc behind was tripped and fell to the ground. Before he could get up, his throat was pierced.

The originally narrow prison door was already blocked by the orc corpses. It was even more difficult for the other orcs to enter.

They could not see at all and could only swing the weapons in their hands according to their feelings and advance step by step. However, every time they moved to the door of the cell, their lives would be pierced and they would fall.

In a moment, more than twenty orcs fell at the door of the cell and the corridor outside.

Chu Xiaoye gradually became bolder. He took his sword and walked out of the cell. Under the cover of the black smoke, he slashed and stabbed. In a while, he killed all the orcs that had rushed into the black fog.

At this moment, he really could not let out his farts.

Recently, he had not eaten meat and did not have many smelly farts. After letting them out this time, he probably wanted to conserve his energy for many days before he could have smelly farts again.

The black smoke started to gradually dissipate and the ground was filled with corpses.

The orcs guarding behind the door still heard the curses and roars of their companions in the black fog a moment ago. At this moment, they could not hear anything anymore.

At this moment, the impact outside was becoming more and more intense.

The entire wooden door trembled violently and let out a sound that was about to break.

The orcs panicked.

Loli raised the sword in her hand and shouted, "Everyone, follow me and kill our way into the cell to catch the Queen\! This is our last chance\!"

Hence, all the orcs roared and risked their lives.

If he did not risk his life now, he would never have a chance after the elven guards broke in.

Coincidentally, the black smoke that covered the corridor and the cell had already started to dissipate quickly and become weaker and weaker. They could already vaguely see what was inside. Furthermore, as they vomited, they seemed to have some immunity to this terrifying stench and did not feel that it was too smelly.

"Charge in\! Kill that little bastard\! Catch the Elven Queen\!"

The remaining orcs followed behind Loli and roared as they rushed into the almost dispersed black fog, charging towards the cell.

"Boom\!"

Right at this moment, the heavy wooden door finally broke open\!

Vilis dragged her huge sword with both hands, her silver hair flying. Her face was cold and anxious as she ran in.

Princess Annie immediately rushed in with her elven guards.

At this moment, Loli had already rushed to the door of the cell with the orcs and was about to rush in without care.

As long as they rushed in and held the Queen hostage, there would still be hope\!

However, they were suddenly dumbfounded\!

The cell was filled with corpses and the door was even stacked. It was filled with the corpses of their companions. All of them were in a miserable state. There was a large pool of vomit at the corner of their mouths and chests.

"Go in and look\!"

Loli kicked the corpse at the door and shouted anxiously.

However, the small jail cell was already filled with the tall and strong corpses of the orcs. No one could enter the door. Although she used all her strength to kick, the corpse still occupied the entrance and squeezed the other corpses around it, not moving.

Furthermore, the corpse's eyes were wide open and the corner of its mouth was filled with filth, as if it was mocking her.

"F\*ck your mother\!"

The young girl, who was originally a beautiful elf, suddenly cried and broke down to curse.

This was the first time she had seen such despicable and shameless dark methods that made her despair\!

"Whoosh\!"

At this moment, the huge sword loli had already swung the huge sword in her hand and spun like a whirlwind\!

Her petite body had already merged with the huge sword in her hand. The narrow passageway was almost filled with her rapid sword light. "Whoosh whoosh whoosh\!" The heads of a few orcs fell to the ground.

The huge sword loli suddenly jumped up and waved her sword. She quickly spun in midair like a crazy propeller and roared as she swept towards the tall orcs\!

Just as those orcs raised the weapons in their hands, those weapons were cut in half and their heads fell to the ground.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

At this moment, Denise and Fei'er's arrows also shot over.

Annie rushed over with her elf guard.

The orcs finally despaired and could only swing their weapons to make their last desperate struggle.

As for the girl named Loli, she seemed to have gone crazy from anger. As she kicked the corpses piled at the door fiercely, she swung the sword in her hand and slashed crazily. She cried and screamed, "Little bastard\! Come out\! Come out\! Let me kill you\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Denise's arrow pierced through her slender neck\!

Loli froze in place and slowly lowered the sword in her hand. She turned her head trembling and looked at the familiar female elves in front of her. Her face was filled with tears as she said, "Demons… You accepted a demon…"

With that said, he raised his body and fell straight to the ground, dead.

Soon, all the orcs were killed without leaving a single one alive.

Vilis was covered in blood. She stood at the door of the cell and looked pale at the corpses piled in the cell.

"Sister." "Night."

Princess Annie cried out with a sobbing voice as she looked fearfully at the terrifying corpses in the cell.

Catherine was also standing at the door of the prison, eager to enter, but she was blocked by the corpse and could not enter.

"Save me\!"

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye's cry for help came from inside. "If you don't save us now, I'll be crushed\!"

The tears trembling in Vilis eyes suddenly froze.

Then, she threw down the sword in her hand and quickly dragged the corpse at the door out.

Annie, Denise, and Fei'er rushed over to help.

Soon, the orc corpses that filled the entire cell were cleared out.

At this moment, they saw the two familiar figures hiding in the corner, almost pressed into one.

Their honorable queen was hugging the young man who was crying for help tightly in her arms, and the young man was naked\!

"Your Majesty, are you okay?"

The huge sword loli was the first to rush up. She grabbed Chu Xiaoye's arm and pulled him up roughly, throwing him to the ground. Then, she anxiously helped his queen up.

"Clothes\! Where are my clothes\!"

Chu Xiaoye realized that his clothes were gone. He reckoned that when they were transporting the orc corpses just now, they had also moved his clothes out.

"It doesn't matter if you wear it or not\! Who wants to see you shorty\!"

Seeing that the Queen was fine, the huge sword loli finally heaved a sigh of relief. She wiped the tears in her eyes and said angrily.

At this time, he almost lost his life and was still thinking about clothes\!

"You're looking\! Everyone's looking\!"

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the ground and protected his vital parts. He pointed at her, then at Denise, Fei'er, Annie, and the other wide-eyed female elves outside the prison.

"Roar—"

At this moment, Catherine suddenly jumped up and pounced into his arms.

The female cub must have been terrified just now.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly remembered that he could completely become a lion.

"I'll change\!"

He roared, but his body did not change.

At the same time, he felt his entire body ache and was exceptionally tired.

"Damn it\! Could it be that the smelly farts have expended all my energy?"

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart. At the same time, he seemed to have suddenly discovered a terrifying fact. Those smelly farts might not be waste gas, but a certain energy in his body—a powerful energy that could make him change his lion and elf status at will\!

"Eh, why hasn't it changed? Could it be that you feel that we haven't seen enough?"

The huge sword loli looked at him in surprise and mocked.

The queen hurriedly took off her robe and draped it over him. She personally helped him up and looked at him with a complicated gaze. "Night, you saved my life again. However, I want to know if there is…"

"Sorry\! Your Majesty, I have no comment\!"

Chu Xiaoye knew what she wanted to ask. Before she could finish, he immediately rejected her.

Wasn't he just asking, "How many farts do you have in your body?"

He would definitely not answer\!

Who would easily expose their bottom line?

Unless they were idiots\!

"Alright, I won't ask anymore."

Lanisi looked at the girl who had fallen at the door with an arrow in her neck. Her expression was sad.

"Your Majesty, Lord Night, Lady Loli has rebelled. There are so many orcs, how are you all okay?"

Fei'er could not help but ask. Then, she suddenly used her hand to fan the air in front of her nose again. She frowned and said with disdain, "When I came in just now, I smelled a stench and almost vomited. Is it the smell of orcs not bathing for many days?"

Chu Xiaoye:"…"

The expression on Lanisi face froze. She looked at him and said evasively, "Should, perhaps, probably."

Vilis had a puzzled expression and said in confusion, "Your Majesty, this cell is filled with Orc corpses. Did you kill them? With my sword skills, I'm afraid it's impossible to kill so many Orcs in such a narrow place. How did you do it?"

The huge sword lolita was very curious. She wanted to know how they killed so many orcs. Furthermore, they had the time and opportunity to use these orc corpses as protective shields and fill this cell.

Lanisi was about to speak when Chu Xiaoye hurriedly urged, "Don't be long-winded\! Go out quickly\! Don't you feel disgusted standing here, looking at these corpses and smelling this blood?"

With that said, he immediately brought Catherine out of the cell.

Lanisi hurriedly followed behind and said to the elf guards, "Clean the cell. Then, seal the entrance and don't let anyone in again."

Suddenly, she thought of Nalia at the back of the mountain.

"Nalia\!"

The Queen's expression changed and she hurriedly said, "Quick\! Follow me to the back mountain\!"

Chu Xiaoye was helpless. He could only wear the long robe that was dragging on the ground, hold his sword, and follow behind them.

However, just as he ran out of the cell, an elf girl with beautiful golden hair rushed over with two elven guards. When she saw the queen, she immediately heaved a sigh of relief and said happily, "Your Majesty, fortunately, you're okay."

When Lanisi saw her, her ugly expression recovered a little and she hurriedly said, "Myna, are you okay? How's Nalia?"

The golden-haired girl answered, "Your Majesty, we're all fine. Princess Nalia is also very good. The dozen or so orcs have been eliminated. Princess Nalia asked me to see you. It's good that you're okay."

Lanisi finally put it down and said, "Myna, let's go and see Nalia. I'm also preparing to bring Night to see her."

Myna hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, Princess Nalia said that if Your Majesty is safe and sound, there's no need to meet again. Furthermore…"

The golden-haired girl looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was wearing a long robe, and whispered, "Princess Nalia said that she doesn't want to see outsiders for the time being."

Lanisi frowned and said, "Night is not an outsider. He is the benefactor of our elves and a member of our elves. Myna, you should have told Nalia, right?"

Myna lowered her head and said, "Yes, Your Majesty. I told the princess everything. However, the princess is still unwilling to see Lord Night."

Then, she looked at Chu Xiaoye and said, "Sorry, Lord Night."

Chu Xiaoye had a nonchalant expression and said with a smile, "Miss Myna, you must have told Princess Nalia the rumors about me and the queen in the elf city these few days, right? It's natural that the princess hates me. I won't care."

Myna looked embarrassed and did not say anything.

Lanisi sighed and said, "Alright, Myna, go back and protect Nalia. Also, tell her that I'll be leaving in a few days. I hope to see her before I leave."

Myna lowered her head and said, "Alright, Your Majesty. I will definitely tell the princess."

With that said, she bowed and left with the two guards.

Lanisi spread her hands at Chu Xiaoye and said helplessly, "Nalia is like this. Even if it's a battle with the orcs and the survival of the elves, she won't come out until the last moment. I never understood her. Night, it's like I never understood you. Your fart…"

"Hey, hey, hey\! Your Majesty, you were talking nicely. Why did you go astray again?"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly interrupted her and said unhappily, "If Your Majesty still remembers me saving your life just now, don't mention that matter again."

Although smelly farts was a skill he relied on to survive, he could not deny that this skill really made him unable to raise his head.

Lanisi smiled and said, "Alright, I won't mention it again."

Then, he raised his hand and helped him pull the robe in front of his chest. He suddenly frowned and revealed a painful expression. "The wound hurts again. It might have been squeezed by you in the cell just now."

The moment he said this, the surrounding gazes immediately looked over uniformly.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly corrected him. "Your Majesty, don't talk nonsense. I was clearly pressed by the orc's body. I was just closer to you and had no choice but to press on you. Furthermore, you pulled me over."

Lanisi smiled frankly and held his hand. "Night, don't be nervous. I'm not blaming you. I just feel that my wound is very painful. We should take the time to heal it so that we can set off quickly, right?"

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the sky.

The sun set and the moon rose. The stars in the sky were like night lamps.

The queen had a deep plan\!

"Coo…"

Right at this moment, a hungry cry came from his stomach.

Lanisi hurriedly said, "Night, you're hungry, right? I'll bring you to take a bath and change into a clean set of clothes first. Then, we'll eat together."

The two of them had just squeezed together with the orc's corpse. They were covered in blood and smelled terrible.

Furthermore, the Queen felt that the terrifying stench must still be lingering in her clothes and hair. She had to take a bath to feel more at ease.

Chu Xiaoye saw her looking at him with watery eyes and suddenly thought of the domineering queen's kiss in the cell just now. His heart immediately trembled and he hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, please respect yourself. I can shower alone. I'm not used to bathing with others."

Lanisi expression froze and she could not help but laugh. "Night, what I mean is that I'll bring you to the bathing hall in the palace. There's a male bath hall there. I'll go back to my room to wash."

Alright, it was a misunderstanding.

Chu Xiaoye had just been naked and covered in blood. He was really uncomfortable now. He hurriedly urged, "Your Majesty, let's go quickly. My entire body is itchy and I'm very hungry."

He was a little strange. When he lived as a lion on the grassland, not only did he not hate blood, he also liked it very much. Even if his fur was stained with blood, he would not care.

Now, he felt especially terrible.

It seemed that not only were the energies in lions and elves different, their feelings were also different.

After transforming into an elf, he could not fart. This was something he was rather regretful about.

Otherwise, when he fought the enemy with his sword, he could completely take advantage of the enemy's carelessness and suddenly kill them with a fart\!

Lanisi brought him into the palace, turned left and right, passed through a long corridor, and came to a not very wide bathhouse. It was dense with fog, but there was no one.

Although it was called a bathhouse, it was actually a pool filled with hot water.

"There's a hot spring underground. The water here is circulating every moment. It's very clean and very warm. Night, you can jump down directly. However, it's a little deep. I wonder if you know how to swim."

Lanisi stood in front of the pool and looked at her with a burning gaze.

Chu Xiaoye also looked at her and said seriously, "Your Majesty, why aren't you leaving yet? Could it be that you're waiting for me to invite you to stay and shower together?"

Lanisi was stunned for a moment, and her face blushed. She looked at him with watery eyes and said, "This… This isn't good, right? After all, this is a male bathhouse…"

"Why aren't you leaving if it's not good?"

Seeing that she did not understand the look, Chu Xiaoye started to chase her away rudely.

He was really uncomfortable, especially when he thought of the ferocious faces and ugly bodies of those orcs.

This blood might be poisonous\!

He could not wait anymore. He wore the Queen's robe and jumped suddenly. With a splash, he jumped into the pool, causing a high splash and spraying the Queen's face.

He took off his robe in the water, swam to the shore, and handed it to the Queen. "Your Majesty, if you really don't want to leave, you can stay and scrub my back."

"Impudent\!"

The huge sword loli came again. She looked fierce and glared\!

Chu Xiaoye could not help but say, "Didn't you say that this is a male bathhouse? It's fine if the Queen came in, but you also came in. If you say that you're not drooling over my handsome and cute body, even a ghost would not believe you\!"

"Pui\!"

Vilis spat at the pool and even spat out some saliva.

Annie hurriedly said from outside the door, "Vilis, come out for a while. I haven't recovered my memories and have forgotten some things. I need your help."

Vilis looked at the Queen and said, "Your Majesty, I'll send you back to your room first."

After what happened just now, she was worried about letting Her Majesty stay here.

Annie said from outside the door, "Alice, Denise, Fei'er, and the other guards are guarding outside. Sister will be fine. Come out quickly. We need to go outside the castle."

Seeing that she was anxious, Vilis could only walk out quickly and say, "Princess, what's the hurry?"

Annie pulled her hand and brought her away. She said in frustration, "I vaguely remember that there's a honey cake seller on a street in the city. It's especially delicious. Vilis, take me to find it."

Vilis:"…"
