Chapter 187: Battle and Mutations

No one expected it.

This rain of blood continued for more than half a month.

At first.

None of the animals cared.

Because it often rained here.

However, when the rain did not stop for three days, the animals started to panic.

The grassland was covered in mud.

The water level of the river started to rise crazily and the river overflowed.

The grass on both sides of the river was submerged by the water.

The entire grassland was battered by the rain.

Be it herbivores or carnivores, they complained endlessly.

The continuous rain for ten days made Chu Xiaoye's territory by the river and the entire forest be drowned by the overflowing river water.

Standing in the bushes, almost all four legs sank into the water.

The herbivores had long disappeared.

Over the past few days, they could only catch fish in the water.

Catherine was afraid that he would not be used to eating them. Last night, she left the territory alone, braved the water and barged into the neighboring territory to hunt.

In the end, she was discovered by the scar-faced lion king next door.

The scar-faced lion king was furious. It brought more than forty lions and female lions and chased her all the way to this forest.

Because the bushes were full of rain, Catherine climbed up the tree immediately. After roaring a few times, they left angrily.

A lion could be unwilling to stand in the muddy water that was as deep as his legs.

Catherine felt that she had lost face in front of him and wanted to chase them. However, Chu Xiaoye stopped her.

As the Chino brothers did not know how to climb trees and could not always stand in the water to rest, Chu Xiaoye let them go to the distant border that was not submerged by the river.

The two brothers were about to break down from the continuous rain.

During this period of time, Chu Xiaoye was especially tired and always wanted to sleep.

Be it day or night, after eating and drinking his fill, he would lie on the tree with dense leaves and sleep, as if he could not sleep enough.

Catherine seemed to be the same.

In weather like this where there was continuous rain, other than sleeping on the tree, what else could he do?

When the rain finally stopped, the sky did not immediately brighten.

The murky clouds covered the sky, causing the entire grassland to appear dark and oppressive.

Chu Xiaoye was bored staying on the tree and decided to catch fish personally.

When he climbed down from the tree, he suddenly realized that the tree seemed to be much taller than before. The branches were thicker and the leaves were lusher.

The bushes soaking in the mud around them seemed to have grown a lot crazily.

In just half a month, the vegetation in the entire forest seemed to have suddenly grown a lot.

He jumped into the muddy water that was as deep as his legs and walked for a distance in the bushes. He realized that this familiar forest had become a little unfamiliar.

The bushes now were like a primitive forest beside the Amazon River. They were lush, dark, and cold. The muddy river water made the bushes look even more mysterious.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was in a daze, Catherine came behind him in the mud and scared him.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at her and saw the shock in her eyes.

Chu Xiaoye decided to walk out of the bushes and take a look at the grassland outside.

Right at this moment, Catherine, who was following behind, suddenly fell into the mud with a whoosh, causing a high splash.

Just as Chu Xiaoye thought that she had accidentally fallen, her entire body suddenly flew up from the water\!

At the same time, a thick python covered in yellowish-brown patterns suddenly jumped out of the mud, wrapped around her body, and smashed her into the water\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. With a whoosh, he jumped up. His right claw flashed with golden light and instantly cut the snake body wrapped around Catherine into two\!

"Whoosh\!"

The snake and Catherine fell into the water.

Catherine suddenly jumped up from the water and grabbed the python's head, shattering its entire head\!

The two parts of the python's body twisted and rolled violently in the mud, causing countless water splashes.

Chu Xiaoye walked to Catherine's side and stared at the python's body carefully.

This python was five meters long and its entire body was covered in hard scales. A row of fins grew on its abdomen. Clearly, it was not a land creature.

"Roarâ€”"

Just as he was feeling bewildered, the roar of a lion suddenly came from the direction of the river.

It seemed to be near his territory\!

"Whoosh\!"

He did not hesitate and immediately brought Catherine to the deep water and ran over.

If a wandering lion invaded, they could not ignore it even if they had to risk the dangers in the water. Otherwise, this territory would not be peaceful in the future.

When they ran out of the bushes with a splash, they saw the situation by the river.

On the other side of the river, there was a tall and strong white lion that was like a water buffalo\!

In the river, an intense battle was happening\!

The already muddy river water was dyed red with blood. Waves splashed and flesh flew everywhere\!

A group of green crocodiles were entangled with a group of patterned pythons and biting crazily\!

Those patterned pythons were the pythons that had attacked Catherine previously.

In the mud on both sides of the river, black crocodiles floated. Every time a python wanted to rush ashore from the river, they would attack crazily.

More crocodiles blocked the upstream, seemingly preventing the pythons from swimming upstream.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. On both sides of the river, the crocodile army was floating neatly. They were like soldiers guarding their territory, sniping at any python that wanted to go ashore from the river\!

As for the mysterious white lion, it stood on the other side of the river and looked solemnly at the river downstream, like a general commanding an army.

Occasionally, a python would break through the crocodile's defence and jump out of the water. When it pounced on it, it would slap it away and break it into two\!

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine were dumbfounded.

The chaos in front of them made them not know what was happening.

However, they knew that they could not let these pythons go ashore\!

Otherwise, this forest or the mud on the grassland would become their hunting ground.

His territory would be filled with danger\!

Even those tall trees would become the most dangerous place.

Chu Xiaoye immediately brought Catherine and walked over. He decided to stand behind the crocodiles and kill the pythons that had escaped\!

This was their territory, and they had to fight\!

However, they did not know if the crocodiles would attack them. They had to be careful.

When the white lion saw them, it was first stunned, but then it immediately roared angrily and looked at them with a dignified gaze, as if it was telling them to scram.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine ignored him and continued forward, stopping behind the crocodiles on the riverbank. They looked warily at the densely packed patterned pythons.

Obviously, these pythons should have swum upstream from the ocean downstream. However, they were stopped here by the crocodiles.

"Whoosh\!"

A python suddenly jumped up from the river. While the crocodiles in front were fighting, it passed over their heads and jumped behind them.

However, before it could enter the mud, Chu Xiaoye had already jumped over and cut its head off with his claw\!

The crocodiles in front of him were shocked, and the white lion on the other side was clearly shocked as well. It looked at him in surprise.

In order to avoid the misunderstandings of the crocodiles, Chu Xiaoye immediately retreated to his original position after killing the python and continued to watch the battle in front of him vigilantly.

At this moment, the two crocodiles beside him were tightly entangled by a python. The other two pythons took this opportunity to quickly swim ashore via the two crocodiles' bodies.

However, just as they were about to dive into the mud, Catherine suddenly rushed over and swung her claws, shattering the heads of the two pythons\!

The corpses of the two pythons immediately rolled and twisted violently in the mud.

The white lion opposite was shocked again and looked at her with a burning gaze.

The battle continued for a long time.

The entire river was almost dyed red with blood.

The corpses of pythons and crocodiles floated everywhere.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine had killed at least thirty plus pythons.

However, they were originally land animals. It was extremely exhausting to fight an enemy in the water. Sometimes, they would even be ambushed by a python that had sneaked up to them at some point in time.

Just as they were exhausted, a loud cry suddenly came from the sky\!

Then, a dense group of snow eagles flew over from the distant sky. They arrived in front of him in the blink of an eye and immediately lowered their heads, quickly diving down\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Their sharp mouths pierced accurately into the python's head. Their sharp claws pierced through the python's scales. They spread their wings and actually brought the pythons into the sky. Then, they threw them at the other pythons in the river\!

These snow eagles were all extremely huge. When they spread their wings, they were actually four to five meters long\!

Those sharp claws seemed to be made of steel and flickered with a metallic luster\!

Their sharp beaks were extremely sharp, like curved blades that flickered with a cold light\!

Dense waves immediately splashed in the river. Python corpses continued to fall from the sky\!

Before long, the river was filled with mangled corpses of pythons.

At this moment, the remaining pythons retreated in a hurry and dived into the water, escaping downstream.

"Roarâ€”"

The white lion immediately roared angrily.

The crocodiles guarding the two banks of the river immediately dove into the river and continued to chase\!

The hundreds of ferocious snow eagles in the sky also lined up and continued to fly down the river.

In a moment, the chaotic scene of flesh and blood just now quietened down.

Both sides of the river were dyed red with blood.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the scene in front of him in a daze.

This grassland was completely different from what he had imagined when he first came to the grassland.

The white lion looked deeply at him and then at Catherine beside him. It hesitated for a moment, as if it wanted to communicate with him, but in the end, it did not say anything. It turned around and ran downstream.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine's limbs were completely submerged in the water.

However, this white lion only had his lowermost calf submerged in the water. From this, it could be seen how tall and terrifying his body was.

Looking at the majestic white lion's back as it quickly left, Chu Xiaoye was secretly envious.

How good would it be if he could grow so big one day? At that time, just standing there would scare the animals on the grassland.

The water was filled with the corpses of crocodiles and pythons, but Chu Xiaoye had no intention of using them to fill his stomach.

Crocodile corpses were not delicious. Furthermore, they had prevented a disaster for his territory. He could not bring himself to eat them.

As for the python corpses, who knew if they were poisonous? He did not dare to try them easily.

When he brought Catherine back to the bushes, he suddenly realized that the cute violent bear mother and son pair had already come down from the tree at some point and were soaking in the mud, eating the python's corpse in big mouthfuls.

From the way they wolfed down the food, it was obvious that this python suited their tastes.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and could not stop them. He looked up and realized that the leopard family of four were also lying on the tree, eating the other half of the python's corpse with relish.

They looked like they were eating happily.

No matter what, this python was considered seafood. The meat was fresh, tender, fat, and rich in nutrients. To these never picky omnivores, it was indeed a good meal.

Many animals had a magical instinct, especially animals that lived in nature. They had a sharp perception of dangerous and fatal food.

Since the cute violent bear and the leopard were eating the python without hesitation, it was obvious that the flesh of these pythons in the sea was not dangerous.

Chu Xiaoye was no longer worried. Just as he was about to climb up the tree to rest, the terrified roars of the Chino brothers suddenly came from the grassland on the other side.

He was shocked and ran over without hesitation.

Catherine immediately followed behind.

They quickly ran out of the bushes, creating a high splash under their feet. Gradually, the mud started to become shallow and then disappeared.

The grassland far from the river was not submerged by the water, but the grass was still covered in water.

When Chu Xiaoye ran close with Catherine, he was shocked to discover that the Chino brothers had suddenly grown bigger. The mane on their necks had also become a thick dark brown\!

The aura of these two fellows also looked much stronger\!

However, they were baring their fangs and looking terrified. They roared and retreated.

In front of them stood two female lions about their size.

These two female lions were dripping wet, their fur was messy, their stomachs were shriveled, and their bodies were covered in scars. Clearly, they were two wandering female lions that had been chased out of a pride.

The nearby grassland was almost completely occupied by the various powerful prides. Over the past half month, they seemed to have suffered a lot.

The rain had just stopped when they discovered the smallest territory, so they decided to try their luck here.

After all, in such a small territory, the pride inside should be weaker and easier to bully.
