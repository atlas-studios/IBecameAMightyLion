Chapter 463: The Power of a Bear\!

It was as if a powerful strength and courage had suddenly been injected into him\!

The big black bear, Tibbs, who was originally trembling and almost peeing in fear, suddenly widened his eyes in anger and bared his sharp fangs. Like a burning flame, he pounced at the eight powerful lions with a whoosh\!

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Before the eight lions could react, Tibbs huge claws had already slapped out heavily\!

It straightened its upper body and bared its fangs that were like daggers. Its face was ferocious and its roar was like thunder. It was tall and strong, as if it was possessed by a demon god, and it sent the two nearly 800 kilograms of lions flying\!

Then, it immediately rushed towards the other lions\!

Like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, its huge iron claws slapped loudly. Every slap hit the lion's fierce and dignified face\!

As for the huge lions, they could not resist at all. Just as they raised their upper bodies and swung their claws, preparing to retaliate, they were sent flying with a slap. Then, they fainted on the ground, half of their faces collapsed, and their faces were covered in blood. It was a tragic sight\!

In the blink of an eye, six lions were sent flying\!

The big black bear, Tibbs, became braver and braver. He roared and pounced at the remaining two lions.

The thirty-over female lions that had just been flaunting their might and aggressiveness stood in place trembling in fear. They watched helplessly as the lions that had once been entangled with them flew out like leaves and landed, never to stand up again.

"Bang\!"

The remaining two lions were the furthest away from the big black bear, Tibbs, and their reactions were the fastest. Seeing this terrifying killing god pounce over, they did not hesitate and turned to run into the female lions. They slapped two of the female lions at the big black bear\!

The big black bear raised its upper body and attacked from left to right again, as if it was playing table tennis. With two slaps, the two female lions that flew over were sent flying\!

Its huge claws slapped the ribs of the two female lions and actually slapped the bodies of the two female lions into a cross shape. They flew seven to eight meters away and landed heavily on the ground, instantly dying\!

When the other female lions saw this terrifying scene, they did not dare to stay any longer and immediately cried out and dispersed.

The two lions used the chaos of the female lions to tuck their tails and flee with all their might. They were like stray dogs and no longer had their previous might and aura.

"Roar\!"

The big black bear roared angrily and its four hooves flew. It actually brought the little girl and chased after them.

Chu Xiaoye's pride was dumbfounded.

They only knew that this big black bear was huge and strong, but it was very timid and wretched. They were not sure of its exact strength. They never would have thought that this big fellow was so strong\!

Chu Xiaoye was rather excited, as if he had suddenly picked up a rare treasure and wanted to cheer.

"Roar—"

Seeing that the big black bear was about to continue chasing with the little girl, Chu Xiaoye immediately growled and ordered them to return.

Of course, his orders were directed at the human girl.

"Tibbs\! Go back\!"

The little girl was very obedient to his orders, and she had already developed to a point where she could understand many of his roars and actions very quickly and accurately.

This girl was definitely a treasure\!

The big black bear that had suddenly erupted like it had lost its mind immediately stopped without hesitation after hearing the little girl's orders. Then, like a demon god that had been possessed leaving, its fur fell, it put away its fangs, and its aura disappeared. In the blink of an eye, it turned back into an obedient kitten. As it wagged its little tail in a fawning manner, it turned around and returned.

The little girl opened her mouth and curved her eyes. She had bright eyes and white teeth. As she gently patted its head, her two slender legs knocked gently on its two sides of its abdomen. She performed as she said, "Tibbs, you did well."

The big black bear immediately shook its head and wagged its tail. It narrowed its eyes with excitement and enjoyment, trembling in excitement.

The little girl was wearing a white dress and riding a big black bear, bathing in the bright sun. Her golden hair fluttered as she returned in high spirits. Her aura seemed to have changed drastically. She no longer had her former timidity and hesitation, and she had become even more determined, brave, and confident.

Her blue eyes looked at Chu Xiaoye fawningly, as if she was a little general who had won a battle begging for praise, or some pitiful fellows begging for praise.

Chu Xiaoye was overjoyed, but his face still maintained the dignity and calm of a lion king as he looked at her calmly.

"Your Majesty, I let Tibos chase away those baddies. What reward do you have for Annie?"

The little girl walked over and did not stand on ceremony. She started to beg for rewards with a smile.

Chu Xiaoye grinned and raised his tail. He turned around and aimed his butt at her, as if he was saying, "Reward farts. Do you want to eat them?"

The little girl immediately covered her nose and snorted. She said angrily, "Annoying\! Petty\! Bad king\!"

The big black bear had long experienced this fellow's invincible fart. Although it had just displayed its might and was invincible, that was because it had been buffed. Now, it was still timid and careful. Seeing the smelly fart lion king move its butt over, it did not wait for the little girl's orders and immediately retreated four to five meters away. It held its breath and was terrified.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and did not tease them anymore. He growled and walked forward with the pride, preparing to find a suitable place to start dividing the territory.

The six unconscious lions gradually woke up, but their faces and bones had collapsed. They were deaf and blind and were on the verge of death. After struggling for a long time, they could not stand up and let out pitiful cries.

Fresh blood emitted a tempting smell. Soon, a group of tall and slender wild dogs smelled it and rushed over, preparing to eat.

"Ga —"

Right at this moment, a loud cry suddenly came from the sky\!

Then, a huge black shadow spread its wings and swooped down from the sky\!

The black shadow was huge and its front and back were seven to eight meters long. Its left and right wings were more than ten meters long and its entire body was green. It also had a lizard-like tail behind it. Its neck was thin and it had two rows of sharp fangs in its mouth. It looked fierce and actually looked like a legendary winged dragon\!

The wild dogs that were wolfing down the food excitedly immediately fled in panic like mice that had seen a cat\!

Before the huge strange bird could land, another fiery red strange bird also swooped down from the sky and let out an even more ear-piercing cry. Its aura looked even more ferocious and violent.

Just as the first strange bird was about to land, it immediately raised its head with a whoosh and turned around. It spread its wings and stuck to the grass on the ground, escaping\!
