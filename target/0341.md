Chapter 341: Untitled

The light was dazzling.

Two jeeps sped over.

When Chu Xiaoye arrived at the borders of the territory, the two jeeps were already only a few hundred meters away.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to call for Mixed Fur and the others to escape, the two jeeps suddenly became slower and slower. Then, they actually stopped.

Panicked cries immediately came from the car.

Soon, the door opened and seven to eight figures jumped out of the car. They held machine guns and started shooting at the red-eyed monsters that were rushing over from behind.

As they fired, they retreated.

Many red-eyed monsters fell to the ground, but they stood up and pounced even more crazily.

Terrified and anxious roars came from the crowd.

Two of the humans were pushed to the ground by the red-eyed monsters and their throats were bitten through. However, the machine gun in their hands continued to fire non-stop.

The remaining humans retreated in panic as they fired crazily.

A tall man protected a mother and daughter and ran towards the territory of the pride of the cold father in fear.

The humans behind him fell one after another.

The red-eyed monsters were extremely fast and their movements were ferocious. They did not seem to be afraid of their machine guns at all. Even though they swept the ground, they still roared and got up.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that there seemed to be some human-like things mixed in those red-eyed monsters. They looked like… zombies.

Some red-eyed monsters were actually tall cows, sheep, and all sorts of animals.

They seemed to have been cursed. Their eyes were scarlet and their faces were ferocious and cruel. They had completely lost their former nature and turned into bloodthirsty monsters\!

Those humans with guns were no match for him\!

Soon, other than the tall man and the mother and daughter, the other humans fell into a pool of blood and were bitten to pieces by the red-eyed monsters.

"Run\! For pity's sake run\!"

When the tall man saw the red-eyed monsters pounce on him, he immediately roared at the mother and daughter pair. He took out his dagger and turned to pounce on the monsters\!

"Chi\!"

The sharp dagger pierced into the neck of a monster and cut off its head.

The monster fell to the ground and struggled for a few times before dying completely.

The other monsters immediately surged forward and pounced at the tall man.

The man roared angrily and pulled the dagger in his hand crazily. He was fierce and brave. In the blink of an eye, he killed two more red-eyed monsters.

His body was also badly mutilated and dripping with blood.

More red-eyed monsters pounced and pressed him to the ground.

The man swung the dagger in his hand crazily. He turned around and roared at the mother and daughter pair, telling them to run quickly, but his eyes revealed despair.

Finally, blood sprayed and his head was torn off by a human-shaped monster. He stopped breathing completely.

As for the mother and daughter, they ran in fear and let out miserable cries. However, they were not careful and fell to the ground.

The golden-haired woman quickly got up, pulled the little girl up, and continued to run.

"Whoosh\!"

A red-eyed monster suddenly jumped up and pounced ferociously. It pushed the little girl to the ground and opened its mouth to bite the little girl's neck.

Right at this moment, the extremely terrified golden-haired woman suddenly let out a scream and pounced on the red-eyed monster. She opened her mouth and bit its nose\!

"Roar—"

The red-eyed monster felt the pain and immediately roared angrily. It immediately swung its head and wanted to throw her down.

However, the golden-haired woman bit its nose tightly and wrapped her arms tightly around its neck, lifting it off the little girl.

The little girl crawled up in fear, her face pale, trembling, and at a loss.

Seeing the red-eyed monsters chasing after her, the golden-haired woman hurriedly loosened her teeth and roared at the little girl, telling her to run quickly.

At this moment, the mother and daughter had already arrived at the border of the pride of the cold father.

Chu Xiaoye, who was about to retreat, realized that Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, the cold father, and every other member of the pride had arrived behind him and were baring their teeth and roaring.

To them, who had just won a battle, no matter how terrifying these red-eyed monsters were, as long as they dared to invade their territory, they would never forgive them\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and did not retreat again. He looked solemnly at the red-eyed monsters.

As for the human mother and daughter, sorry. He was a lion now and could not do anything. He had no reason to save them.

The golden-haired little girl fled in fear and crossed the border, but she suddenly stopped in her tracks and froze in place. Her eyes were filled with tears as she looked at the group of fierce lions in front of her with a pale face, almost fainting from fear.

Behind him, the golden-haired woman's miserable scream came.

The little girl's entire body trembled as she trembled and turned around. She happened to see her mother being torn to pieces by the red-eyed monsters and her blood splashing.

Her body turned limp and she knelt on the ground.

The group of red-eyed monsters immediately ran over again.

"Roar—"

The cold father roared angrily and walked out majestically. He stood at the border and bared his fangs, looking fiercely at the group of red-eyed monsters.

Then, he slapped the golden-haired girl to the ground.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail, Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, the Jerry brothers, the Chino brothers, and every member of the pride of the cold father bared their teeth and roared angrily, looking fierce.

When the other prides in the nearby territory heard the roar, they also roared and rushed over to help.

After all, their king was still here.

Little Curly Tail suddenly pounced in front of the golden-haired little girl and bit towards her head.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him and tilted his head, causing him to fall to the ground.

Little Curly Tail looked up at him with an aggrieved expression.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and walked in front of the golden-haired little girl. He extended his claws and rubbed her soft golden hair. Then, he shook the golden mane on his neck and turned his head to look around, including the cold father.

"She looks like me. Therefore, you can't hurt her."

Other animals could kill this little girl, but he would never let a member of his pride do such a thing.

After all, he was once a human.

The red-eyed monsters stopped and gathered together, looking at them with bloodthirsty and cold eyes. However, they suddenly quietened down, as if they were weighing their strength.

Among these red-eyed monsters, there were monsters that looked like humans and more monsters that looked like animals. They seemed to be instinctively afraid of this group of ferocious kings of the grassland.

Looking at their thinking appearance, Chu Xiaoye was secretly shocked. This group of monsters not only looked like they had thoughts and consciousness, but also intelligence. They seemed to be very different from zombies.

"Roar—"

The cold father could not hold it in anymore. Just as he was about to rush up and show his might, Chu Xiaoye slapped him down.

They had yet to cross the line, so what was the hurry? Unless it was his last resort, Chu Xiaoye did not want to provoke these strange creatures of unknown origins.

The cold father lay on the ground and raised his head, glaring at him. He was trembling in anger, as if he wanted to bare his teeth and roar, but he did not dare to. He could only turn his head and glare at Callie behind him.

Callie turned away and looked elsewhere.

"Roar —"

Among the red-eyed monsters, a human-shaped monster let out a roar. It lowered its head and lowered its arms as it walked over, as if it wanted to cross the line.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and flicked his claws.

The human-shaped monster ignored him and roared. It suddenly ran, jumped up, and pounced over. It was as agile as an ape.

It seemed to want to test the strength of this pride for its companions.

"Whoosh\!"

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and jumped up. He swung his golden claw and cut it in half\!

The human-shaped monster immediately fell to the ground, its head split in two, and its body twitched a few times before it died\!

Chu Xiaoye had just seen it clearly. Although these red-eyed monsters were invulnerable, they were most afraid of having their heads injured. As long as he cut their heads or cut their heads off, he could kill them.

The tragic death of this human-shaped monster immediately stunned the group of restless red-eyed monsters behind.

It seemed that their instinctive fear did make sense.

"Buzz —"

Just as the two sides were nervously confronting each other, a buzz suddenly came from the night sky.

Hearing this familiar buzz, Chu Xiaoye was shocked and immediately looked up.

Indeed, a huge black cloud suddenly appeared in the dark sky and was quickly landing.

They were a group of bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes that were the size of sparrows\!

As they landed, the entire night sky was almost covered.

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and let everyone surround him and stand closer.

It was impossible to escape. The more panicked he was, the faster he would die.

Fortunately, his smelly fart was enough to restrain these demon mosquitoes.

Just as he was accumulating strength and preparing to fart, the group of demonic mosquitoes with a murderous aura enveloped the group of red-eyed monsters and ignored them.

As for the group of red-eyed monsters, they seemed to have already suffered greatly from the demon mosquitoes. When they saw this scene, they did not even have the intention to resist and immediately turned to escape.

However, no matter how fast he ran on the ground, how could he outrun flying in the sky?

The black mass of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes rushed down like a storm and instantly surrounded the group of red-eyed monsters. They landed on their bodies and pierced the needle-like sharp mouthparts.

"Roar—"

"Ah —"

"Baa —"

The cries of all sorts of animals rose and fell.

There were wild beasts, humans, herbivores, and those red-eyed monsters actually let out their original cries at this moment of fear and despair.

Under the attack of the densely packed Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes, the ferocious red-eyed monsters quickly turned into withered corpses.

They struggled with all their might, ran with all their might, and bit with all their might, but they still could not escape misfortune.

Just now, those humans were chased by them, torn to pieces, and killed by them. But now, it was suddenly their turn.

The miserable scream did not last long before it returned to calm.

The red-eyed monsters that were filled with killing intent just now were only dried corpses on the ground. No one could escape.

After the group of bloodthirsty demon mosquitoes drank their flesh, their bodies became even larger and terrifying.

"Buzz…"

They flew up and floated in the air, looking at Chu Xiaoye and the other wild beasts of the grassland.

Then, they formed a huge black cloud again and flew over.

Mei Mei shivered and hid behind Chu Xiaoye.

Tilly crawled under his crotch and lowered her head to suck the pearl on her neck, praying silently.

The cold father, who had been preparing to flaunt his might just now, had already peed his pants in fear. He was trembling and did not know what to do.

Little Curly Tail raised his broken tail, bared his fangs, and prepared to fight.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he quietly curled his tail and started to accumulate strength.

However, when the black mass of Bloodthirsty Demon Mosquitoes flew close, they suddenly stopped in midair and did not take another step forward.

They seemed to have smelled something and stared at Chu Xiaoye for a few times before suddenly flying into the sky and leaving.

"Roar—"

At this moment, the cold father, who had already peed his pants, suddenly raised his head and roared at their backs, as if he was shouting for the thief to not leave and eat his claws\!

Then, he raised his hind legs and squeezed out some urine in front of everyone to show that he was marking the territory.

However, no one bothered with him.

The members of the pride of the cold father looked at the golden-haired little girl lying on the ground.

This golden-haired little girl was probably only seven or eight years old. She was wearing a snow-white princess dress, white long socks, white leather shoes, blue eyes, and white skin. She had a rather exquisite appearance and was clearly a child of a rich family.

However, why were they here?

Was she here to play or did she come specially?

What happened in the human world?

Chu Xiaoye looked at the little girl in front of him and was secretly puzzled.

The grassland had already undergone a tremendous change, and the animals and plants had evolved and mutated. The world of humans would never be calm.

This mutation might have already put the humans at the top of the food chain in danger.

All the creatures they had oppressed and killed might gather their courage and resist again.

As for whether humans could stand firm with their wisdom and strength again, no one knew.

The current him could not care less.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his gaze, turned around, and prepared to leave.

Little Curly Tail was stunned. He started baring his fangs at the golden-haired little girl again and was eager to pounce.

He liked this little thing's golden hair and wanted to tear them off and wear them on his neck. This way, he would be as mighty and beautiful as his brother.

Just as Chu Xiaoye turned to leave, the golden-haired little girl lying on the ground suddenly stood up and quickly followed behind him.

She seemed to have recognized this young lion's status in this pride.

Only he could protect her.

Only he did not show her the fierce gaze and hostile expression that he wanted to eat her.

In this dark and cold grassland, she was alone, helpless, and in despair. She could only hug her last hope and follow closely behind this young lion king, seeking a trace of safety that might not exist.

At some point in time, a crescent moon peeked out from the dark clouds.

The little girl's mind was blank. She followed Chu Xiaoye into the bushes like a puppet.

When Chu Xiaoye climbed up the Baobab tree, the little girl stood under the tree, looking up at him pitifully. Her big blue eyes were filled with helplessness.

Little Curly Tail deliberately bared his teeth at her and jumped onto the Baobab tree.

Mei Mei went to her side and stuck out her nose. She sniffed her scent and sneezed. Then, she opened her mouth and looked at her kindly to express her friendliness.

The little girl fell to the ground in fear, trembling, as if she was afraid that this dark-eyed lion would suddenly give her a bite.
