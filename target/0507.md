Chapter 507: Broken Soul Sword

Time was precious.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to spend this short night in bickering.

He extended his hand towards the giant sword fairy and said without blushing, "Lend me your sword to play with."

Vilis rejected immediately. "No\!"

She was the only one who could use her sword.

Queen Lanisi pulled out the sword at her waist and handed it over. She looked at him in surprise and said, "You know how to use a sword too?"

Vilis sneered and mocked, "He knows nothing\!"

After saying that, she could not help but laugh and said, "He indeed only knows how to fart."

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and reached out to take the Queen's sword. He weighed it in his hand and said, "It's too light."

Vilis snorted disdainfully and immediately raised her chin, showing the appearance of a great swordmaster. "A sword is not light. Only the person who uses it knows how to use it. No matter how light a sword is, it can kill. If you only have some brute force, no matter how heavy a sword you have, you can only swing it and not kill."

Obviously, she was mocking him. Other than being strong and only knowing how to shatter the motionless wooden door with one slash, he did not know how to use a sword to fight.

"Why don't we try?"

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and looked at her.

"Clang\!"

Without a word, Vilis immediately pulled out the sword on her shoulder. Her eyes were burning, as if she could not wait.

She had long wanted to use her superb sword skills to teach this fellow a lesson. Now that he had automatically delivered himself to her door, she could not ask for more\!

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and took a few steps back. "Your sword is heavier than mine and your sword arts are better than mine. Let me try my hand with two strikes first. Don't retaliate, okay?"

Vilis raised her chin slightly and held the sword with both hands. She leaned the huge sword in front of her and said with disdain, "I'll let you have five strikes. I'll only block and not retaliate. After five strikes, I'll defeat you with one strike\!"

"Alright\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not speak anymore. He immediately held his sword and rushed up.

Vilis narrowed her eyes, her silver hair flying and her face calm. When the other party rushed in front of her and waved the sword in her hand, she kicked with her right foot and raised the sword in her hand.

"Clang—"

An ear-piercing buzz sounded\!

The two swords collided and sparks flew\!

Chu Xiaoye's sword cut heavily on Vilis' blade.

Vilis stood steadily on the ground without moving.

"First move."

She said calmly. The elegance of a Great Swordmaster was vividly displayed at this moment.

Beside him, Annie exclaimed, "Vilis is so powerful."

The huge sword loli was even more pleased.

"Clang—"

Chu Xiaoye slashed a second time from another direction, but it was still blocked steadily by Great Swordmaster Lolita.

"The second move."

Vilis continued to remind him.

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and circled around her, slashing a third time.

Vilis did not even turn around to listen to the sounds. She extended her huge sword back and blocked it again.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but admire this little elf's superb swordsmanship.

However, he did not use up all his strength.

"There are still two more strikes."

The huge sword loli sneered.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of her, took a few steps back, and suddenly rushed up. He suddenly jumped up, swung the sword in his hand, and slashed down.

This was like his move when fighting enemies on the grassland, using strength to decide the victor.

"Clang—"

With a buzz, sparks flew\!

Vilis' arms trembled and her expression changed slightly. Her two feet almost fell into the mud.

Chu Xiaoye landed in front of her and the corner of his mouth curled up.

"Hmph, there's still one last move."

The huge sword loli deliberately appeared very relaxed.

This time, Chu Xiaoye decided to use his full strength.

This giant sword sprite was born with divine strength. Since it could block his first four strikes, it could probably block the last one too. However, it would definitely suffer a little.

Chu Xiaoye did not retreat anymore and stood in front of her. He held the sword with both hands and suddenly slashed forward with a whoosh\!

Vilis took a deep breath and raised her sword to block again.

"Clang—"

"Crack\!"

Sparks flew and the huge sword in Vilis' hand was suddenly cut off\!

Chu Xiaoye's sword continued downward with strength and hit the silver armor in front of her chest with a bang.

The others who were watching at the side were shocked.

Chu Xiaoye was also shocked and hurriedly sheathed his sword.

He never would have thought that his opponent's extremely powerful sword would be broken.

Vilis held the broken sword and stood in place in a daze. The silver armor on her chest was also cut open, revealing her pink undergarments and towering breasts.

This was definitely not the outcome Chu Xiaoye wanted.

Even an outsider knew clearly how important this huge sword was to this elven loli.

Furthermore, they were about to fight.

"Sorry, I…"

Chu Xiaoye's apology even made him feel a little weak.

Queen Lanisi walked over quickly and said apologetically, "Vilis, it's my fault. I forgot that my sword was made of Vanity Island's fine steel. Sorry."

She had not thought of this at all just now, because she never would have thought that this lion would be so strong.

"Clang\!"

The broken sword in Vilis' hand fell to the ground.

She held her chest with one hand and suddenly raised her other hand to slap Chu Xiaoye's face. She cursed, "Shameless\!"

There were tears in her cursing.

She ran away like a little loli who had been bullied by a bad uncle.

Chu Xiaoye covered his face, looking wronged.

He swore that he definitely did not aim there deliberately. Why was it so coincidental that he cut off her sword and happened to slash at the bulge?

Fortunately, he restrained his strength in the end. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"Your Majesty, your sword."

He sighed and returned the sword to the queen.

Lanisi looked at him with bright eyes. She did not reach out to take the sword. Instead, she removed the sheath at her waist and handed it to him. She said, "No, Night, from today onwards, this is your sword."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly said, "Your mother gave this to you…"

After saying that, he suddenly understood.

Lanisi said with a complicated expression, "Even if I don't give this sword to you, I won't use it again. Take it. The battle will start soon. Although you don't have sword skills, you have strength and agility. You can deal with ordinary orcs with it."

Chu Xiaoye looked at the sword in his hand. It was about four feet long, the blade was wide and sharp and cold. There were two blood grooves engraved in the middle. On the spot near the sword hilt, the emblem of the elves was engraved—a bird.

Even Vilis, the swordmaster, used an iron sword. From this, it could be seen how precious this sword made of fine steel was.

"Why don't you give it to Vilis?"

Chu Xiaoye suggested.

Lanisi shook her head and said, "She won't use this sword. To her, a sword that's too light will affect her swordplay."

At this point, the Queen smiled and said, "Don't worry, our craftsmen will soon make another one for her. A day is enough."

With that said, Chu Xiaoye was indeed at ease.

He took the sheath and put away the sword.

"It was once called Flame and was given by my mother. Now, you can give it a new name."

The Queen whispered.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment and said, "Let's call it Broken Soul. A cold light appears and the enemy's soul is broken\!"

However, when he turned into a lion during the day, how could he take this broken soul? If he carried it on his back, he would become a burden.

Lanisi seemed to have seen his worry and said, "You can find a sword attendant who will hold the sword for you and be inseparable with you."

"Inseparable?"

Chu Xiaoye subconsciously turned around and looked at Catherine.

However, he could not let Catherine be a sword attendant. He could not waste the abilities of this female cub.

Annie rolled her eyes and was eager.

However, the Queen's gaze made her not dare to speak.

"You will find it."

The Queen patted his shoulder and smiled meaningfully.
