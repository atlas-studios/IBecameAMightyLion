Chapter 320: Lion King Iron Tail

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and another black lion fell.

When Balo passed through the barren grassland and entered the desert, there were only three lions left behind.

He turned around and looked terrified. He stepped on the soft and hot sand and continued to flee in panic.

It was noon.

Chu Xiaoye was a little anxious.

When he saw that the black lion king was still walking on the ground in the desert without decreasing in speed, he hesitated for a moment.

At this moment, Tilly suddenly jumped over and swung her golden claw, shattering the spine of a lion and causing it to fall to the ground.

The little white lion continued to jump up and passed by the remaining two black lions, pouncing on the black lion king.

Before Chu Xiaoye could roar, her snow-white and light body flew out with a bang and fell heavily towards them.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up and swung his claws, bringing her steadily to the ground.

The black lion king only swung its tail and did not even turn around.

There was a scar on Tilly's head that looked terrifying.

If not for her strong physique and tough bones, her skull would have shattered from the tail and she would have died\!

The little lioness was furious. She bared her teeth and roared, but her body turned limp and she fell crookedly on Chu Xiaoye. She rolled her eyes and looked like she had been slapped unconscious.

Chu Xiaoye twisted his body and threw her to the ground, continuing to chase after her.

Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and the others followed closely.

No one bothered with her.

Tilly could only get up from the ground and chase after him.

Another black lion was exhausted and fell behind. Its life was ended by Chu Xiaoye's claw.

However, Chu Xiaoye became a little vigilant.

They had slowed down because of Tilly, but the black lion king had clearly slowed down as well.

Now, the distance between them was still the same as before, neither too far nor too close.

Just as he was feeling puzzled, Little Curly Tail suddenly roared angrily and jumped over, pouncing on the black lion king.

Just now, this black lion king had used its tail to slap Tilly away, which made him extremely angry.

Playing with his tail in front of his tail brother was humiliating him\!

"Whoosh\!"

When he pounced behind the black lion king, the remaining black lion immediately turned its head and opened its mouth to pounce on him.

Little Curly Tail twisted his butt and slapped him with his tail\!

The lion's mouth was instantly badly mutilated and dripping with blood. Its head tilted and it fell to the ground.

Before he could stand up, Little Curly Tail slapped him again. With a bang, his head shattered and he died\!

The black lion king did not turn around and continued to run forward, its speed clearly increasing.

Little Curly Tail roared angrily and swung his tail to chase after him.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and followed behind. He stared at the retreating figure of the black lion king and felt that something was wrong.

He raised his head and looked at the desert in front of him.

He could not see the end.

There was a lack of water in the desert, no plants, and very few animals survived. Lions would never come here often.

However, this black lion king did not even turn around and ran forward without hesitation. It did not change directions and seemed to be extremely familiar with this place.

This made him very suspicious.

Although he was uneasy, he had to eliminate the roots.

For the sake of the stability of the grassland, he had to kill this powerful black lion king. Otherwise, the other party would have any chance to take revenge and make a comeback.

"Pfft—"

An explosion\!

Behind Chu Xiaoye, he suddenly spewed out smoke and his figure jumped up. With a whoosh, he flew out and landed in front of the black lion king.

The reason why he only used this skill now was because this black lion king was now alone and had already exhausted a lot of its energy.

Perhaps it was still a threat to him, but it was not fatal.

If he had used this skill from the beginning, even if he stopped the other party, he would probably have suffered the ferocious attacks of the black lion king and its subordinates when Little Curly Tail and the others could not support him in time.

He would never underestimate this powerful lion king that led the entire black lion tribe.

The other party's leap by the river and the strength he used to slap those boulders were definitely not a match for the powerful black lion with a human mark on its leg.

Back then, the black lion was on par with him and fought for a long time.

Although his strength had improved, there was no need to risk his life to be brave in this situation where he had already won.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

He raised his golden claws and pounced at the black lion king in front of him. He prepared to test the other party's true strength and continue to expend his energy.

However, the other party clearly did not intend to give him a chance.

Just as he pounced close, this black lion king suddenly jumped and passed by three to four meters above his head. It landed six to seven meters away and continued to run.

Chu Xiaoye turned around, narrowed his eyes, and actually hesitated again.

From the black lion king's jumping movements and height just now, the other party's stamina was still greatly preserved, but it did not jump too far.

He had clearly jumped nearly twenty meters away by the river previously. Now, even in the desert, he could not have only jumped six to seven meters away.

Could it be that the other party deliberately did not jump far and deliberately attracted him to continue chasing?

Just as he was feeling bewildered, Tilly suddenly jumped over his head and roared as she pounced at the black lion king.

Little Curly Tail also wagged his tail and rushed over angrily.

Catherine stopped in front of him and looked at him questioningly.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and chased after her again.

Perhaps because of his saliva, these members who had been licked by him or treated with water had stamina that was different from other lions and were very strong.

They had been chasing until now and still did not fall behind.

Catherine and Mei Mei followed beside him.

Mixed Fur and Jerry brothers followed closely behind him.

The three huge and strong lions still looked energetic.

As for Little Curly Tail and Tilly, they had already run in front of him.

Suddenly, a sand dune appeared a few kilometers ahead. It was like a continuous mountain range that stood there.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with two golden lights and he saw them exceptionally clearly.

If he wanted to cross the sand dune, he would need more strength and slow down.

Perhaps, that was the place where this black lion king died\!

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued to chase.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail's iron tail slapped the black lion king's tail heavily, causing a series of sparks under the dazzling sun\!

The black lion king's tail was black and shining like metal, flickering with a cold luster\!

Little Curly Tail landed on the ground and swayed, almost falling.

However, he was not discouraged. He roared angrily again and rushed up.

The tail behind him actually spun quickly behind him. It spun faster and faster like the propeller of a helicopter, causing sand and rocks to fly and the wind to roar\!

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly accelerated and jumped out, instantly charging in front of the black lion king and scratching its eyes\!
