Chapter 559: Southern Tang Country

The originally quiet street was noisy.

Due to the fact that this town was rather prosperous and trade all over the world passed by here, Southern Tang attached great importance to this place and stationed twenty thousand troops here.

When they received the news, the general stationed outside the town immediately ordered his subordinates to rush over with 200 soldiers.

The death of the patrolling soldiers was enough to alarm the army.

The other patrolling soldiers of the town also came after hearing the news.

However, at this moment, Chu Xiaoye had already caught Catherine and Doya. He brought the girls and rushed out of the encirclement, charging out of the town.

His path was blocked and pursuers rushed over from other directions.

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and immediately abandoned his original direction, charging into the territory of the Southern Tang Empire.

Riding on the warhorse, through the dark night, he could clearly see if there were soldiers blocking the way. The other party was not prepared at all. Even if he had just received the news, he could not react in time.

Soon, they rushed out of the town and continued to run towards an unfamiliar plain.

The torch behind him swayed and there were still pursuers chasing after him.

The commandant rode his horse and continued to chase with the soldiers.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stop and ran with the girls.

Fortunately, the few warhorses that the fat girl gave them were all superior goods. Furthermore, they had mutated and had extraordinary physiques. They were still full of energy after running until now.

At this moment, the unconscious Vilis and the other two finally woke up from the bumping.

Lanisi interrupted to tell them what happened.

Vilis jumped onto her warhorse and said angrily, "I want to kill those bastards\!"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and said, "If you want to kill yourself and kill us all, go ahead."

Vilis blushed and said, "I told you to shut up\!"

Thinking of how she was almost abducted and sold to a brothel previously, she felt uncomfortable all over. The anger in her heart did not set off. She suddenly slapped her horse's butt and shouted, "Go\!"

Then, he ran in front.

When Doya heard the process of her being abducted and saved, her face was pale. She said to Chu Xiaoye, "Lord Night, thank you. If not for you…"

"If not for me, you would still be the Missy of Bingluo City."

Before she could finish, Chu Xiaoye turned around and smiled.

Doya was touched, but she did not know how to express it. She could only smile.

The pursuers behind could no longer be seen, but the danger was not resolved.

After dawn, they slowed down and continued forward.

This was a valley filled with flowers and grass.

The horse had been running for the entire night, and was thirsty and tired. Therefore, it was eating grass as it walked forward.

After passing through the valley, they came to a main road.

Due to having deviated from the original path previously, no one knew where this main road led. They could only walk forward in a fixed direction.

Before long, Catherine, who was scouting in front, suddenly stopped and jumped onto a big tree at the side with a whoosh. She narrowed her eyes and looked ahead, her tail starting to sway.

"There's someone ahead. Everyone, be careful\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately got down from the horse and instructed Lanisi and the others to wait here. He and Catherine went forward to investigate.

Lanisi looked at Denise, who was beside her, and Denise immediately followed.

If they were discovered and there were not many enemies, Denise's arrows could make the other party not dare to chase after them.

Chu Xiaoye soon saw a group of tall men with machetes.

These people were taller and stronger. They were bare-chested and had fierce expressions. At this moment, they were hiding sneakily on both sides of the road, and in the middle of the road was a big tree.

Obviously, they were a group of bandits that were preparing to stop and rob.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was carefully counting the other party's numbers, the sound of hooves suddenly came from behind. It was not the voice of Lanisi and the others.

"There are people behind too\!"

He immediately returned with Catherine and Denise, preparing to abandon the horses with Lanisi and the others and run into the forest at the side to hide.

But it was already too late.

A group of men in uniform blue walked over from behind with a few carriages.

At the front were three strong men riding tall horses.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the carriages with a flag stuck in each of them. The flag fluttered in the wind and the words "Dragon Might Escort" were written on it.

At this moment, he finally understood.

This was an escort team, and the ones ambushing on both sides of the road in front probably had long received the news, so they had long ambushed here and prepared to snatch the cargo.

At the thought of this, he secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He pulled the horse and gave the girls a look, letting them go to the side of the road.

"Who's in front?"

The escorts were very vigilant. When they saw someone appear on the road, they would immediately stop and ask.

One of the strong men riding a horse walked over with the knife at his waist in his hand. He sized up Chu Xiaoye and the others with a dignified gaze. Seeing that there was only one youth and the others were young girls, he relaxed and said, "Are you traveling?"

Chu Xiaoye nodded and said, "Yes, the horses are a little tired. Let's rest by the road for a while."

The strong man nodded and waved at the back. "The few young people traveling. It's okay, you can go now."

Chu Xiaoye looked carefully at the team behind him. There were more than thirty people in total, and all of them were big men with plain knives at their waists. They looked to be martial arts practitioners, but no one knew what was in the four carriages.

He had just counted the bandits in front of him. There were about fifty of them, and they all looked like ferocious figures who were not afraid of death.

If they fought later, this escort team might be completely wiped out.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was hesitating about whether to remind them, when the first carriage passed by them, the curtain at the window suddenly opened. A little girl stuck her head out and looked at them with her dark big eyes. Then, she said excitedly, "Sister\! Sister\! It's elves\! They're elves\!"

A girl's face also popped out from the window. She stared at them curiously and nodded slightly, taking it as a greeting. Then, she carried the little girl in and whispered, "Little Guai, don't be like this. It's very rude."

The little girl said anxiously, "Sister, I still want to look\! I still want to look\! There are so many beautiful elf sisters\!"

In the second carriage, a man's cough suddenly sounded. Then, a woman's voice sounded, "Old Master, when we return this time, we won't go to the border again. Your body is not good either. No matter how much money you earn, you can't spend it all. Furthermore, Li-er and Little Guai don't like to live there either. Little Guai should enter the school too."

The man sighed and said, "Since you've brought everything, you naturally don't intend to come again. There are more and more merchants here. Business is really difficult. It's better to return to our Suhang."

The woman smiled and said, "That's best."

When the second carriage passed by Chu Xiaoye, Chu Xiaoye finally could not help but say, "There's an ambush ahead\!"

The moment that was said, the entire team immediately stopped.

"Little brother, did you just say that there's an ambush ahead?"

A man protecting the carriage hurriedly asked.

The three men walking in front hurriedly reined in their horses and looked back.

Chu Xiaoye nodded and said, "We heard sounds just now. I went to the front to take a look alone and realized that there was a big tree in the middle of the road. A group of people ran towards the forest on both sides and hid in the ditches on both sides. If I'm not wrong, they should be bandits who blocked the way to rob us."

"Bandits?"

Everyone's expressions changed.

"Brother, could it be Liu Bazi and the others? Didn't we already fight them? They dare to stop the escort of my Dragon Might Escort?"

"It might not be them, or it might be someone else."

"How do they know about this dart? Could it be that there's a spy in our escort company?"

"Who doesn't know that we left the city in a majestic manner? It might not be a letter from a traitor. If it's a robber, there will naturally be their people in the city, watching the carriages that leave the city at any time."

"Stand here and protect the carriage first. I'll go over with Second Brother and Third Brother to take a look. If you know each other, just give us some hard money."

The three men at the front discussed for a while and immediately rode over.

Soon, they saw the big tree that was blocking the middle of the road.

At this moment, they had already confirmed the elf youth's words.

The bandits who blocked the way usually blocked a tree in the middle of the road. When they stopped to move the tree, they would suddenly attack and stop them from escaping.

"Which brother is preparing to have designs on my Dragon Might Escort? Please come out and meet me?"

The strong man riding the horse did not dare to move forward and immediately shouted.

However, there was no response in the forest on both sides of the road.

"Brothers, there's no need to hide. We have already seen you\! I, the Dragon Might Escort, have never offended anyone. I, Long Yaotian, know all my brothers who are here and have already fought. May I ask, which path are you from?"

The strong man shouted again.

At this moment, the bandits already knew that they had been exposed. They could only roar angrily and rush out of the ditches in the forest on both sides.

One of the bald men with a scar on his head shouted, "Long Yaotian\! Leave the jewels on the carriage and the two rich girls behind. I can spare your lives\!"

"Niu Kui\! It's actually you\! You snatched my Dragon Might Escort. Did you tell your boss?"

Long Yaotian was shocked and furious when he saw who it was.

The bald man named Niu Kui stopped talking and immediately rushed up with a murderous aura.

"Go\!"

Long Yaotian immediately turned around and fled with his two brothers. He shouted at his subordinates guarding the carriage, "Everyone, attack\! Kill these bandits\!"

The men in the escort company had all gone through all sorts of life and death trials. They immediately pulled out their knives and waited solemnly.

The little girl, who had been making a ruckus in the carriage to see elves, was so scared that she did not dare to make a sound.

"Kill—"

The bald man rushed over with more than 50 bandits and roared.

"Night, what should we do?"

Lanisi and the girls looked at Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye pulled out the sword at his waist and said, "What else can we do? We must attack. Didn't you hear what the bandits said? Not only do they want jewels, they also want rich girls. The few of you are much more tempting than the two rich girls. If the bandits win, they will never let you go."

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he finished speaking, Denise had already shot her arrow and hit the bald bandit named Niu Kui in the face\!

Before this leader of the bandits could react, he fell to the ground with a bang and rolled a few times, dying.

The other bandits did not retreat and still roared as they rushed up.

Denise's arrow shot out again.

Fei'er also started to aim and shoot.

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and rushed up with Lanisi and Vilis.

Vilis' spinning storm was already unbearable. In order to vent her anger regarding last night, she used all her strength and started to kill.

The warriors of the escort company were also good.

Before long, there were only a dozen or so bandits left.

Seeing that their defeat was decided, the ten-over bandits did not dare to stay any longer. They turned around and fled towards the forest at the side.

"Catherine\! Denise\! Fei'er\! Leave none alive\!"

Chu Xiaoye ordered.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine rushed up like lightning.

Denise and Fei'er chased forward as they quickly pulled the string and shot arrows.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

In the blink of an eye, the remaining ten-over bandits all fell to the ground. Catherine killed three, and the rest were killed by Denise and Fei'er's arrows.

Just Denise alone had killed at least twenty people.

This tall and charming silver-haired girl was really superb with her bow and arrow, causing Chu Xiaoye to praise her sincerely.

The reason why Chu Xiaoye wanted to kill those bandits was firstly because he was afraid that the other party would continue to bring people to pester him, and secondly, he was afraid that the other party was colluding with the soldiers.

At this moment, what they did in that town had probably been spread long ago. If the soldiers discovered them, it would be terrible.

"Thank you for your help\! I wonder where you're going. We can travel together. We'll pay for all the food and accommodation on the way. We'll cover them all as thanks to you."

The man named Long Yaotian walked over and said gratefully and respectfully.

He had finally seen what it meant by there was always someone better than you. Not to mention the two elven girls' superb archery, just the underage girl who was waving a huge sword could be called terrifying when she swung her huge sword. She could be said to be able to kill anyone in her way. No bandits could withstand a move from her.

In his opinion, these young elves were all extraordinary experts.

With them around, the journey would definitely be much safer. It was worth it to waste some money.

"Does anyone know the fastest way to Rakshasa Kingdom?"

Chu Xiaoye decided to ask for directions first.

"Rakshasa Kingdom?"

When Long Yaotian heard this, he immediately said, "Everyone must have taken the wrong path to Rakshasa Kingdom. You have to return immediately and walk through White Goat Town. There's a big road there that can lead to the border of Rakshasa Kingdom. If you continue forward, you will only walk further and further away."

Chu Xiaoye knew in his heart that the White Goat Town this person was talking about was definitely the town they had fled previously. They could not return to that place.

They had killed so many soldiers. Wouldn't they be walking into a trap if they returned?

"Is there any other way? We're not in a hurry to go to Rakshasa Kingdom. We still want to walk around Southern Tang. I wonder if there's a path to Rakshasa Kingdom if we continue forward?"

Chu Xiaoye did not show any change in expression and appeared very natural.

"This…"

Long Yaotian frowned and thought carefully. "Our Southern Tang has a few paths to Rakshasa Kingdom, but they're too far away. The closest one…"

Right at this moment, the curtain of the second carriage suddenly opened. A middle-aged man in good silk walked down and cupped his hands at Chu Xiaoye and the others. "Thank you for your help just now. I was on the carriage just now and heard this young volunteer say that he wants to go to the Rakshasa Kingdom, right?"

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he hurriedly said, "Yes, but we still have to walk around Southern Tang. White Goat Town will definitely not return."

The middle-aged man smiled and said, "That's good. The righteous warriors will follow us to Suhang. Not only is the scenery there good, it's also the richest place in Southern Tang. At that time, I can do my best as a host and accompany a few righteous warriors to walk around. On the east of Suhang, there's a harbor with many goods stopping there. Most of them are going to sea to other countries, and some are going to Rakshasa Kingdom. It's very fast to take a boat to Rakshasa Kingdom. It won't be more than five days. I happen to have a few friends there who specialize in running the business of Rakshasa Kingdom. At that time, I can let them bring you along."

Take a boat? Go out to sea?

Chu Xiaoye was delighted and hurriedly said, "Thank you."

If he could take a boat and follow those merchants to the Rakshasa Kingdom, he would definitely avoid a lot of trouble along the way. He would not have to worry about being eaten and sleeping while traveling. It would definitely be much more worth it than traveling like this.

The middle-aged man smiled and said, "I'm Qin Zhitan. In the car are my wife and my two daughters. When we return to Suhang this time, we will definitely thank you well."

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "My name is Chu. There's no need to call me a righteous warrior. They're my friends. Just call them girls. There's no need to be polite. When we go to Rakshasa Kingdom, we'll have to trouble Uncle Qin."

Hearing this word "Uncle Qin", the middle-aged man laughed out loud and immediately became even closer. He said, "Alright, alright\! This is not a place to talk. Let's hurry up. Why don't Young Master Chu and everyone sit on the horses? We can have a good chat."

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly rejected, "We don't like to ride carriages first. It's more comfortable riding horses."

He did not want to chat with others. For someone who had just met, it was naturally better to talk less lest he was accidentally cheated.

They were criminals who had killed Southern Tang soldiers.

Seeing him say this, Qin Zhitan could not force him anymore. He exchanged a few more pleasantries and got into the carriage.

The little girl also stuck her head out of the window and looked at Chu Xiaoye. "Brother Chu, are you an elf? I heard that you elves can fly and don't need to eat every day, right?"

Chu Xiaoye rode his horse and teased her with a smile, "Yes, we all know how to fly. We don't have to eat. When we're hungry, we can just catch a few disobedient children to eat."

The little girl widened her eyes and was stunned for a moment. Then, she rubbed her chest and said, "Fortunately, Little Guai is obedient. Little Guai is not a child anymore."

The girl's laughter came from the carriage.

Then, the little girl was carried back.

"Little Guai, be obedient. Don't stick your head out again. If not you'll be eaten by your elf brother."

The girl smiled and finished speaking. She picked up a book from the side and continued to read.

The little girl felt very bored and pouted. "Sister, stop looking. Why are children looking at poems? Talk to Little Guai. Do the elf brothers outside really eat disobedient children?"

The girl put down her book and looked at her with a smile. "What do you think?"

The little girl tilted her head and thought for a while before saying, "I don't know either. The elf brother and the elf sisters have just killed many baddies. They should be good people. Good people don't eat children."

The girl smiled and rubbed her little head. Her eyes flickered and she did not answer.
