Chapter 326: Spray Running

In the second territory.

It was still two black lions, a group of female lions, and some young cubs hiding in the camp.

Chu Xiaoye no longer had any mercy and eliminated them all.

The aura of the thirty-over lions leaving spread out and went to various parts of the forest.

However, a portion of them gathered and went further ahead, towards the forest at the edge of the oasis.

The smell of blood left behind by the black lion king had already disappeared. However, if the other party was really not dead, he must have mixed in with the group of lions and gone to a safer place to heal.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others and continued forward.

When the sky was about to turn dark.

He stopped and looked solemnly at the forest in front of him.

The night was the best disguise for the black lions, and for the black lions who were familiar with the terrain here, it was the best time to ambush.

Although he was eager to kill the enemy, he would never risk his life and Little Curly Tail's.

He pondered for a moment and decided to climb up the tree to wait and spend the night safely.

The wound on his abdomen and the eyeball that had been dug out could not be completely healed in a few nights.

Even if the powerful black lion king was still alive, even if he was given some time to heal, he would definitely not be able to recover to his former peak state.

After the sun set.

A crescent moon rose into the night sky.

This oasis hidden in the desert blew with the cool night wind under the bright moonlight and a faint fragrance of flowers drifted. It was quiet and beautiful.

The lake not far away was wrinkled by the wind and rippled with light.

Insects flew over the lake, but with a whoosh, it was caught by a fish that flew out of the water and fell into the water, disappearing.

In the distant bushes.

A mouse crawled out and rustled as it searched for food on the grass. However, it saw a black shadow flash above its head. It let out a squeak and was caught in the sky, landing on a branch not far away.

It was an owl.

Chu Xiaoye squatted at the highest point of the tree, his eyes flickering with a golden light. He scanned the surrounding forest and looked clearly at the real animal world in front of him.

A furry, snow-white body suddenly came to his side and stuck to his body. She mimicked him and looked around.

Then, she saw two wild dogs stacked together, trembling, not knowing what they were doing.

Then, she widened her eyes and froze there without moving.

Until Chu Xiaoye left, she had yet to recover.

The moonlight was bright and gentle like water.

Chu Xiaoye quietly climbed down the tree and walked towards the lake.

The air was filled with the coolness and sweetness of the lake water. From afar, the lake water was clear and beautiful, like nectar. It made his heart pound and he felt thirsty.

When he came to the lake, he felt even cooler.

A gentle breeze blew over, like a pair of slender hands gently tidying his face.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked at himself in the lake. He had messy hair and a dirty face. His golden fur was flamboyant and his eyes were dignified without being angry. Two small golden lights like needle eyes flickered in his eyes.

He was a little dirty, but he was indeed very handsome.

"Tsk tsk…"

The lion king by the lake praised himself in the mirror and became happier and happier.

Suddenly, a black shadow strangely appeared under the handsome face in the water.

"Eh?"

Chu Xiaoye widened his eyes and looked carefully. It was not his image. His huge triangular head, scarlet eyes, and slowly open mouth overlapped with his reflection.

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere\!

The black shadow suddenly broke out of the water, opened its bloody mouth, and bit at his handsome face\!

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He raised his claws and slapped it.

"Bang\!"

A crisp sound\!

The black shadow was sent flying and fell heavily into the lake.

It was a black python\!

"Whoosh\!"

Unexpectedly, just as its head fell into the water, its tail jumped out of the water and wrapped around Chu Xiaoye's neck at lightning speed. It suddenly pulled and Chu Xiaoye was caught off guard. With a whoosh, he was pulled into the lake and instantly sank.

At this moment, Catherine ran over quickly and was about to jump into the lake without care. With a bang, a water pillar suddenly rushed into the sky\!

Chu Xiaoye sprayed air from behind and broke out of the water. He dragged the python's tail on his neck and flew to the shore. He suddenly twisted his head and the huge python, which was six to seven meters long, was dragged up from the bottom of the lake and fell ashore in a sorry state.

Before it could react, Chu Xiaoye pierced his claws into its abdomen and dragged it to run crazily on the shore.

"Pfft—"

Air sprayed from behind him and his limbs jumped as if they were flying. With a few leaps, he disappeared from Catherine's vision.

Catherine froze in place, stunned.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Tilly, who had rushed over, quickly came to her side, but they could not see anything.

After a while.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye dragged the python and ran back from afar, like a gazelle chased by a cheetah.

He jumped into the sky and jumped more than ten meters. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared again, dragging a long black smoke behind him like a black dragon.

The pitiful python that had mutated and finally grown to six to seven meters long did not have the strength to resist at all. It was dragged behind weakly, its head bleeding and it had long fainted from fear.

Soon, Chu Xiaoye dragged the python and jumped back. With a bang, he threw it to the ground.

At this moment, the python's skin and flesh were already lacerated. Its head was broken and it was dead.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at it again. Instead, he tried to jump again and suddenly jumped more than ten meters away. Just as he landed, he jumped up again. With a puff, he spat out a stream of air and suddenly accelerated, jumping nearly thirty meters away\!

After landing, he ran for a distance before stopping.

With his intelligence, he actually only realized it just now when he jumped and ran like an antelope.

Back then, he had only used this airflow on the running method of lions and thought that it was very good to be able to speed up. He really did not expect that he could use this airflow and learn to jump and run continuously like the gazelle.

Although this jumping method was very inelegant to lions, or to a handsome lion king, and was very different and comical, it was definitely an impressive skill when facing an enemy\!

Of course, the prerequisite was to fight the enemy alone.

If there were other companions following behind, they would probably not be able to catch up to the enemy or be caught by the enemy. It would be bad if they fainted or sprayed their companions on the ground first.

Furthermore, when jumping, the higher the better. He had to control his speed well. Otherwise, he would be broken or fall flat on the ground. That would be embarrassing.

Now, he had three ways to run.

Ordinary running.

Gas spraying style running on fours.

Gas spraying gazelle style running.

If these three running methods could be mastered and interchanged easily, be it when chasing the enemy, escaping, or fighting, they would be like lions with wings\!

"Roar—"

Tilly, who was beside him, could not help it.

The little lioness covered her nose with her claws and looked at him in pain. She looked extremely disdainful, as if she was complaining. "Can you not pollute the air?"

Indeed, development and progress could not do without destruction.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his tail and retracted his gas. However, he suddenly remembered that when this little white lion pretended to be stupid, it seemed to be quite satisfied with his fart. It sucked it with relish and enjoyed it.

Although it was pretending, from the situation at that time, this little white lion was completely immune to his farts.

Now, she was clearly pretending to be unable to tolerate it.

Indeed, women liked to pretend.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked in front of the black python. He cut open its skin with his claws and realized that the python meat was fresh and smelled not bad. It could be said to be delicious.

Now, he was not too picky about food. He was very satisfied if he could eat his fill.

He called for Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine to share this fresh and juicy snake meat.

After eating and resting, he could continue fighting tomorrow.
