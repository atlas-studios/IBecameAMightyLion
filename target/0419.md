Chapter 419: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye took the initiative to attack and rushed over at lightning speed.

The hyena queen's golden eyes revealed surprise.

This young lion king indeed had something.

With her claw, even rocks would be cut in half. She had once smashed the heads of all sorts of ferocious beasts.

However, just as he slapped the young lion king's head, the other party only swayed his head a few times and was safe.

This was not just a symbol of strength. The other party's body was clearly extraordinary\!

The hyena queen stood in place and did not do anything else. She did not dodge quickly or show signs of fighting.

When Chu Xiaoye pounced in front of her and swung his sharp claws at her head, the hyena queen's eyes flashed. She only turned her head and easily avoided the sharp golden claw.

At the same time, her claws slapped out at lightning speed.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye was slapped in the head again and flew out, landing heavily on the ground.

There was only one more bright spot, but their strength was worlds apart. Their speed and strength had undergone a qualitative change, like the level of strength in some fantasy novels.

The ability Chu Xiaoye was so proud of immediately paled in comparison to the two lit up, or rather, the second-level hyena.

His speed and strength had already reached the peak of this level. He originally thought that he was already very powerful. Unfortunately, the other party was another level higher than him.

This slap really woke him up.

In this current where the entire world evolved and mutated, his little ability was really nothing.

He had only used his intelligence to win a few battles and kill a few weaklings. He actually forgot how hard he worked and improved when he was young.

When he was young, he trained and improved every day.

Chu Xiaoye fell heavily to the ground. His head was in pain and he was dizzy. However, the consciousness in his mind seemed to be enlightened and was exceptionally clear.

This time, the hyena queen did not give him a chance to get up. She jumped over with a whoosh, raised her claws, and slapped his head again.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped down from above and bit the hyena queen's neck\!

However, before the two rows of sharp teeth could close, the hyena queen's body trembled and she sent the figure flying, landing miserably on the ground.

It was a young female leopard with slender limbs and a soft body. Even though she looked fierce and angry, her eyes were watery. Clearly, she was in heat.

The hyena queen's eyes revealed surprise. She looked at the female leopard and then turned to look at the young lion that was getting up from the ground. She felt that it was a little absurd.

"Roar\!"

Belia was furious and fierce.

This smelly female dog actually dared to trample on her mate. Uh, to be more civilized, it was her future mate. Damn it\!

Leopards were not cheetahs. Under normal circumstances, leopards were not afraid of a lone hyena. If they were not too careful, they could kill the other party.

However, this hyena was clearly not an ordinary hyena.

Of course, she, Belia, was naturally not an ordinary female leopard.

Therefore, she was not afraid. Instead, she was a little excited and secretly happy. Damn female dog, good job\! You're the stepping stone for me to obtain mating rights\! After I defeat you in front of that kid, that kid will immediately be grateful and kneel in front of me in admiration. Oh, no, he'll be behind me, doing what a lion should do\!

"Roar —"

"Die\!"

Miss Belia roared angrily and rushed up. Thinking of the scene of that kid kneeling and licking her, she almost peed her pants in excitement.

"Bang\!"

However, in the next second, she was sent flying and hung upside down on a big tree at the side. Her head was lowered and she swayed. Her vision was filled with sparkling little stars.

When the hyena queen slapped her away and was about to pounce on her again, Chu Xiaoye had already recovered. A stream of air suddenly spurted out from behind him with a puff and instantly pounced in front of the hyena queen, grabbing her stomach\!

The hyena queen was clearly shocked by his speed, but her reaction was fast. She hurriedly jumped up diagonally and dodged narrowly\!

Chu Xiaoye passed by her, and his sharp golden claws brought with them some flesh and blood.

The hyena queen landed on the ground and looked at him in shock and coldness. Her stomach was trembling slightly and a shallow wound was left on it.

She seemed to find it unbelievable that she was injured and her stomach was almost ripped open\!

"Whoosh\!"

She was a little embarrassed and angry. She ignored the female leopard and focused all her attention on the young lion king.

Because she felt a threat from the young lion king's calm eyes.

Belia hung on the tree and shook a little before twisting her body and climbing onto a branch. She looked down and still felt dizzy and weak.

Although the slap just now did not shatter her head, it finally woke her up. The difference between her and this hyena queen was not small.

However, she would not admit defeat easily, let alone let her king fight alone\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Chu Xiaoye's claws finally slapped the hyena queen's claws\!

This was the first time he was fighting this hyena queen head-on\!

However, clearly, the strength that he had been proud of was no match for her.

A huge force surged from her claws and sent him flying.

Before he could land, the hyena queen had already caught up. With a whoosh, she jumped up and pierced her sharp fangs at his back\!

A dog could not change its habit of eating sh\*t.

As for the spotted hyenas, no matter how strong they were or how much they evolved, they could not change their habit.

For animals, they could be proud of any combat technique as long as they could win.

What the hyenas were proud of was their technique of digging anuses. As long as they touched it, any animal would have to lie down and instantly lose the ability to resist.

The hyena queen clearly did not want to dawdle with him anymore and wanted to end the battle quickly.

However, she would never have thought that the skill she was so proud of would be countered by the skill Chu Xiaoye was so ashamed of.

"Boom —"

Just as the hyena queen opened her mouth and her sharp fangs were about to pierce into Chu Xiaoye's back, an explosion suddenly sounded\!

At the same time, black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye and hit the hyena queen's open mouth and face heavily like a violent storm\!

The fur on his face flew back and the flesh on his face trembled non-stop, twisting and deforming. Even the two round and cute little ears on his head swayed. The dog tongue in his mouth flew out of the corner of his mouth and quickly trembled on his face. His dog eyes were wide open, as if the end of the world had arrived\!

The pitiful hyena queen was sent flying by a fart\!

She was a little stunned…
