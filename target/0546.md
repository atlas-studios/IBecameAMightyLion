Chapter 546: Hunting in the Grassland

Five days later.

They entered another country.

This time, Doya immediately became careful.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and could see the vast green grassland below, extending to the distant horizon.

There were no mountains or hills, only an endless grassland and a river like a silver belt.

"This is the Tutur grassland and belongs to the Mori Empire. It is said that the king who founded this empire has the bloodline of a ferocious beast and can command all sorts of animals on the grassland. I don't know if it's true. However, everyone here seems to have combat beasts. They are very brave and fierce in battle and have no contact with our Kast Empire. Therefore, we have to be careful."

Doya explained as she looked at the sky around her.

At this moment, the flying fire dragon suddenly hissed and started to land.

Doya hurriedly said, "Athies is tired and needs to rest and eat. Previously, when we were in the mountains, we planned to let it land to rest. Unfortunately, this girl is too stubborn. She thought that she could fly over this grassland in one go."

At this point, the girl sighed and looked down sharply. "I hope we don't encounter the Mori Empire's army. As long as we don't provoke ordinary orcs, they usually won't care about us."

The grassland was lush and filled with bushes. Even at a high place, it was difficult to discover if there were enemies hiding below.

Looking at this familiar environment, Chu Xiaoye was very excited. He said, "It's okay. Our luck isn't that bad. We'll rest for the night, eat something, and set off tomorrow morning. It's impossible for there to be orcs everywhere in such a big place."

Doya was still a little worried. "I hope so. If Athies isn't full, he won't be able to take off. He eats a lot. It's very dangerous to hunt here alone. Flying at a low altitude is too striking. Therefore, we have to help him hunt."

The fire dragon quickly landed and soon landed in a forest. It used the dense and tall bushes to cover its huge and striking figure.

It turned to look at Doya and let out a neigh, indicating that it was hungry, but it was lazy to move.

Even if it wanted to move, Doya would never let it move.

Doya rubbed its neck and comforted it softly. "Athies, stay here and don't move. We'll help you find food. If other pterodactyls discover you, we'll all suffer."

The fire dragon lowered its head, closed its eyes, and lay on the ground to rest.

Chu Xiaoye and the others climbed down from it.

Just as he landed, Chu Xiaoye turned into a lion. He jumped onto a big tree at the side with a whoosh and looked out at the grassland.

Catherine followed behind him and climbed up as well, looking at him excitedly with her dark eyes.

She liked this environment and him.

Only here would she feel that he belonged to her.

"Fei'er, what are you waiting for? Help Night pick up his clothes and sword."

Lanisi reminded.

Fei'er was looking up at Lord Night in a daze. When she heard him, she hurriedly bent down and picked up the things on the ground.

"We have dinner\! There's a group of water buffaloes on the grassland half a mile away. It's enough for us and Athies to eat our fill\!"

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree with Catherine and said excitedly.

Big water buffalo\! This King is here\! Quickly tremble\!

"Then let's go together\!"

Doya was eager to try and seemed to like the environment here very much.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the fire dragon, who was resting with its eyes closed, and said, "Is it okay to let Athies stay here alone?"

Doya smiled and said, "No problem. Athies' aura is very strong. Ordinary wild beasts don't dare to approach. When I came down just now, I also checked carefully. There are no orcs nearby."

Lanisi said worriedly, "Miss Doya, your body…"

This girl looked soft and weak. Other than a dagger hanging at her waist, she did not have any other weapons. She did not seem to have practiced fighting. She was afraid that when she went, she would encounter danger.

Although she had never been to the grassland, she knew how terrifying water buffaloes were. Even the ferocious beasts on the grassland could only avoid them when they encountered violent water buffaloes.

Be it the water buffalo's horns, iron hooves, or the ferocious impact, they could cause fatal damage to their flesh.

This girl was their guide through the various beast countries and was the favorite granddaughter of the City Lord of Bingluo City. If anything happened, not only would they be unable to explain to her, their mission might also be blocked.

Doya knew how worried she was and hurriedly said, "I won't implicate you. I promise."

She blinked her big eyes and looked at Chu Xiaoye with a begging expression. Clearly, she wanted to go very much. She knew that only this youth, or rather, only this lion, had the most say in this team.

"It's okay, go ahead. Catherine and I will protect you."

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at Catherine and said, "Catherine, stay beside Miss Doya. Don't let anything happen to her, okay?"

Catherine turned her head elsewhere, clearly unwilling.

The female cub had finally come to the grassland and naturally wanted to be released.

"Alright, let's go."

Chu Xiaoye took the lead and walked out of the bushes.

When hunting on the grassland, he and Catherine were the best hunters. However, no matter how good a hunter was, they could not compare to arrows.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye knew clearly that Denise and Fei'er were the experts at hunting in this team.

Although he was excited and wanted to flaunt his might on this grassland, he knew that he had to maintain his consciousness at this time.

The grassland here was not ownerless. Those strong and barbaric orcs might appear at any time.

He had to end the battle quickly\!

The water buffalo was larger and had abundant meat. If they added Athies, three of them should be enough.

Soon, he smelled the water buffaloes.

It was already dusk.

The sun hung on the horizon, swaying.

The water buffaloes would eat grass for a while before going to the river to drink water.

They had to take action as soon as possible and not let the water buffaloes run too far.

The grass was lush and covered their figures.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front and gestured for the girls behind him to bend down and quietly approach.

When they were still 100 meters away from the water buffaloes, Fei'er finally could not help but whisper, "Lord Night, the distance is enough. Sister Denise and I can shoot."

Their archery was perfect.

Denise could even shoot three arrows in a second, or even all three.

Chu Xiaoye looked in front of him and immediately lost his interest in ambushing them. He said, "Alright, prepare. In a while, Catherine and I will chase the water buffaloes away or lure them away. Otherwise, even if you shoot them, you won't be able to get their corpses. If the water buffaloes suddenly flare up and rush here together, you'll be doomed no matter how powerful you are."

"Night, then you have to be careful."

Lanisi held her sword and said with concern.

Chu Xiaoye did not say anything else and immediately rushed out with Catherine.

The water buffaloes that were leisurely eating grass were shocked to see the two lions charging over. They prepared to escape, but under the lead bull, they suddenly became brave.

"Moo—"

The water buffaloes were furious. Not only did they not run, they immediately gathered together and lowered their heads, charging over aggressively.

When the two sides were only ten meters away, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine immediately changed directions and ran to the left.

At the same time, Chu Xiaoye shouted, "Denise, Fei'er\! Shoot the three at the back\!"

In this case, if the water buffaloes in front only cared about running forward, they might not discover that their companions had fallen behind them. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him and Catherine to lure the water buffaloes away.

However, he said it too late.

When the water buffaloes turned around and continued to chase after him and Catherine, Denise and Fei'er's arrows had already shot out\!

They had never seen such a situation. The water buffaloes kicked like thunder and had a murderous aura. They ran together like a magnificent army. They were afraid that Chu Xiaoye and Catherine would be injured and had the intention to kill the enemy and kill the generals first. Therefore, without thinking, they aimed the arrows in their hands at the two water buffaloes at the front.

"Bang\!"

The two water buffaloes at the front had their heads pierced by the arrows and they fell to the ground. Hence, the water buffaloes following behind were also tripped by three to four.

Fei'er said excitedly, "Lord Night, I hit it\! Run\!"

This was bad\!

The intelligence of this group of water buffaloes had long evolved and were not something ordinary grassland water buffaloes could compare to.

When they saw their leader fall, they immediately stopped chasing. They then heard Fei'er's shout, and their gazes immediately looked at the hiding place of the few elf girls.

"Moo—"

The water buffaloes immediately changed directions and ran towards them with a murderous aura\!

"Not good\! Run\!"

Seeing that the situation was wrong, Lanisi hurriedly got up from the grass, pulled Doya up, and turned to run.

The water buffaloes' iron hooves rolled and they were aggressive, causing the ground to rumble.

Even the fearless Vilis' expression changed. She carried the huge sword and turned to run.

Seeing that she had gotten into big trouble, Fei'er cried as she fled, "Sorry… sorry…"

Denise was still calm. There was no panic on her calm and beautiful face. As she ran, she turned around and shot arrows. Every arrow could make a running water buffalo fall.

Her legs were extremely long and her movements were light. Her silver hair fluttered and she fluttered lightly in the grass like a butterfly.

The water buffaloes were even more furious. Their iron hooves were like thunder as they chased relentlessly.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine could only change directions and chase after them.

They were faster.

"Denise\! Stop shooting\!"

Looking at the water buffaloes fall, Chu Xiaoye felt that there was no need.

As a former lion king on the grassland, he knew how important these water buffaloes were in the natural food chain. Three of them were enough for them to eat, so there was no need to kill too many.

"Whoosh\!"

He increased his speed and caught up to the water buffalo at the back. Then, he suddenly jumped onto the back of the buffalo.

The water buffalo was running when it suddenly realized that a lion had jumped up. It was terrified and ran even faster.

Chu Xiaoye used it as a springboard and started to jump and run on the densely packed backs of cows.

Catherine followed closely.

Soon, Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the back of the water buffalo at the front and stood steadily. He looked at the girls running in front of him and said, "Hurry\! Run towards the bushes in front\!"

Denise deliberately fell behind and prepared to use arrows to stop the fastest water buffalo. Seeing that he was riding on the water buffalo and hearing him tell her not to shoot anymore, she could only give up.

With a few leaps, she passed Fei'er and Vilis and ran to Lanisi's side.

She did not want to fall behind and be watched by that fellow from above.

"Vilis\! Shortie\! Run faster\! Be careful not to be trampled flat."

Chu Xiaoye rode on the cow and urged loudly.

These female elves were very fast, but their legs were no match for their four hooves. They chased after the water buffaloes crazily and the distance quickly closed.

Vilis suddenly stopped and pulled out the sword on her shoulder. She turned around and glared at him with a cold expression.

She knew that she could not outrun this group of water buffaloes. Therefore, instead of escaping in a hurry and being trampled to death, it was better to stop and fight bravely to death\!

Lady Vilis would never be a coward\!

"Come on\!"

She held the sword with both hands and had a determined gaze, looking down on death\!

When the water buffalo Chu Xiaoye was riding on was about to charge over, she suddenly made way and aimed her sword at a water buffalo behind her.

If she killed the first water buffalo, the bastard on the water buffalo's back would definitely fall too. At that time, he might be trampled into meat paste by the iron hooves behind before he could react.

Although she was angry at that bastard, she did not want him to die.

"Shortie\! I'll leave Her Majesty to you\!"

She swung the sword in her hand and said angrily.

However, when the first water buffalo rushed past her, Chu Xiaoye, who was on the cow's back, suddenly extended his claws and shouted, "Jump up\! Catch\!"

Vilis was stunned for a moment before she immediately understood.

"Whoosh\!"

She held the sword with one hand and jumped up. She extended her small hand forward and grabbed his claws.

Chu Xiaoye was afraid of hurting her and did not flick his sharp claws. The moment her small hands grabbed his feet, he suddenly pulled her over and landed on the running cow's back.

Almost in a flash, the place where she originally stood was already drowned by the majestic herd of iron hooves.

A moment later, she was trampled into meat paste.

Although her spinning storm was powerful and her sword arts were superb, it was useless in front of this group of running water buffaloes.

Vilis landed on the cow's back, but she swayed and almost fell down again. Fortunately, she grabbed the golden fur on Chu Xiaoye's neck.

Chu Xiaoye trembled in pain. His four sharp claws pierced into the cowhide and he stabilized his body tightly. He said angrily, "Hug me\! Don't grab\! Your fur is going to be scratched off\!"

The mane on his neck was the symbol and dignity of a lion. Even a lioness could not touch it, let alone this shorty\!

Vilis ignored him. She still grabbed his mane with one hand and swayed on the cow's back.

If she hugged it with her hands, she would definitely throw away the sword in her hand. However, this sword was her life and she could not lose it.

Finally, there were bushes not far ahead.

The water buffaloes seemed to be exhausted from chasing and slowed down.

Their huge bodies made their running endurance not strong, and their anger and madness could only last for a short time.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to heave a sigh of relief, he suddenly realized that pairs of amber cold eyes had appeared in the dense grass in front of him.

"It's a pride\!"

There were actually prides lying in ambush here\!

It was very likely that the nearby pride had heard the movements of the water buffaloes and rushed over to ambush here.

"Lanisi\! Be careful in front\! There are lions ambushing\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted.

To these elf girls, the pride was definitely more dangerous than the water buffaloes\!

Chu Xiaoye looked carefully and realized that there were more than five strong lions\! There was even a black-haired lion that was even larger than the saber-toothed tiger\!
