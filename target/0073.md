Chapter 73: Little Leopard

What was dignity?

For a mother who was about to leave, being able to see her daughter in her last moments should be more important than dignity.

Furthermore, when she abandoned her daughter to survive, she had already lost her dignity.

She only wanted to see her daughter now.

She only wanted to know if she was okay.

Otherwise, she would not have chosen to end her life here.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine in front of the lioness, then turned around and left with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

They still had to train.

Birth, illness, and death were the natural laws of every life.

On this grassland, life passed away every moment. Who could change anything?

The lionesses were terminally ill and could not be saved.

Even if he could be saved, he would not do anything.

At most, he could only help her fulfill her wish and let them meet. He wanted her to have a daughter protecting her in her last moments and not let other carnivores eat her body alive.

This was enough.

He was a lion.

He was really just a lion.

"Roar\!"

"Come, train your muscles with me\!"

He brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to the forest not far away and started training.

Mei Mei looked at his graceful movements and leaned behind him in admiration. She wanted to rub against him to show her affection and please, but he kicked her face without any mercy.

Little Curly Tail gloated and deliberately went in front of Mei Mei, as if he was saying, "Come, it's the same if you rub my face."

Mei Mei slapped his butt\!

Little Curly Tail was furious. He immediately turned around and pounced on it.

The two little fellows started to chase and fight.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at them but ignored them and started training.

Now, his speed and strength were increasing, and his hunting skills were not inferior to that of a lioness. He was only lacking in size and teamwork.

Of course, he also lacked a mane.

A lion could not have no mane.

The mane made the lion look majestic without being angry. They made them look stronger, more majestic, and more handsome.

Without a mane, he would not even be able to get girls in the future, let alone dominate the land.

He had to grow up quickly and become a true lion\!

There were very few prey in the bushes at night.

He found nothing these few nights.

However, he did not starve.

The food stored on the Baobab tree could not be touched for the time being. He had to save it for the most difficult times.

Therefore, he learned to catch birds and dig their nests.

Although the taste was not good, he could still eat them.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were eating with relish.

As for Catherine, he did not know if she liked it or not. However, every time he deliberately threw her some in the grass, she would snatch it away.

Little Curly Tail loved to eat woodpeckers.

However, although there were many trees in this forest, woodpeckers were not common.

Woodpeckers liked to eat the brains of other young birds and always took advantage of their parents' absence to secretly fly into their nests, pecking the heads of young birds and eating their brains.

They liked to make nests in the trees, and they also liked to peck open the bark and suck the sap of the trees, causing harm to many trees.

Of course, they also ate the bugs in the tree.

Overall, they were not beneficial birds.

However, in nature, every creature wanted to survive. There was no such thing as good or bad.

"Roar\!"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was exercising, Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail ran over with their mouths open and were panting.

They were thirsty and wanted to drink water.

Every time their brother came out, he would bring a big bag of sweet water with him. It tasted much better than the water they used to drink in the river.

They had never discovered the secret on the Baobab tree, where a thick layer of animal skin was laid.

Therefore, they did not know where their brother got this water.

They only knew that their brother was very powerful and could get anything.

Regardless of whether he was hungry or thirsty, as long as he came to find his brother, his brother would definitely be able to resolve it.

Their brother was the king in their hearts, the omnipotent king\!

But this time, his brother ignored them.

"Roar\!"

Mei Mei was anxious. Her mouth was dry, and she stuck out her tongue again. She walked behind Chu Xiaoye and wanted to rub against him in a fawning manner.

Before Chu Xiaoye could kick her, Little Curly Tail, who was beside her, pushed her away with a look of disdain.

This stupid fellow, can you stop making your brother angry? How can a lioness like you rub his butt? That's for his younger brother—I, Brother Curly Tail, to rub\!

After Little Curly Tail knocked Mei Mei away, he hurriedly went behind his brother in a fawning manner and prepared to rub against him.

Chu Xiaoye was still merciless. He raised his hind leg and kicked him in the face.

Could these two fellows stop flattering him?

"Roar\!"

He called out majestically and walked towards the orchard with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

He did not bring any water tonight.

The ground of the orchard was full of mature fruits and there were also some green fruits on the branches.

There should be a lot of water stored in it.

He had wanted to try these things for a long time, but he did not know if the lion's taste buds and stomach could handle it.

Normally, it should not be a problem.

Lions' food was mostly freshly killed prey. Occasionally, they would eat some meat that was not fresh, and most of them had parasites growing inside.

Therefore, sometimes, lions would go and eat grass to let the grass enter their stomachs and then pull out those bugs.

Many lions had many bugs in their feces.

Of course, there were definitely no parasites in Chu Xiaoye's body.

Even if he ate parasites, they would definitely be killed by the things inside his stomach.

Or rather, they would die from the smell.

They came to the orchard.

Chu Xiaoye searched the ground for a while. Seeing that most of the fruits were rotten, he could not bring himself to eat them.

He raised his head and looked at the tree, preparing to climb the tree to pick some green fruits.

However, on the fruit tree beside him, a little leopard was digging its nest.

At this moment, she was lying in front of the bird's nest with her head lowered and her eyes wide open as she looked at him. The corner of her mouth was covered in the egg liquid of the bird egg and there were a few feathers on it. She did not seem to have thought that he would discover her and looked silly and adorable.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and stared at her for a while before looking away and preparing to go elsewhere.

However, it was already too late.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei had already discovered the little leopard on the tree.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail was immediately excited. Without any explanation, he jumped onto the fruit tree with a whoosh\!

Leopards and lions were competitors.

If they encountered the other party's cubs, they would never show mercy.

Usually, leopards were superb at climbing trees, and lions could not do anything to them.

But now, this little leopard had encountered three cubs who knew how to climb trees and were very good at it\!

Little Curly Tail was very fast.

Belita was terrified.
