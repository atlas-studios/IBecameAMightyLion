Chapter 369: Untitled

Fortunately.

After dawn, the rain finally stopped.

The sky was clear and blue.

The sun shone through the pure white clouds, bringing warmth to the grassland again.

The gazelle hanging on the tree had already shed all the blood and dust after the rain and was slowly baking in the sun.

When the little girl woke up, Chu Xiaoye had already left.

Outside the bushes, there was silence. A wild rabbit was pricking its ears and looking for food in the forest.

The little girl felt a little hungry.

The fruits from yesterday could not fill their stomachs.

The beef jerky in her pocket was also finished on the way.

She opened her pure and innocent big eyes and quietly looked at the wild rabbit that was hunting for food, afraid that she would disturb it.

She only crawled out of the bushes when the wild rabbit jumped away,.

What should she eat?

Just as she was frowning and thinking seriously, she suddenly realized that there was a piece of fresh meat hanging on the branch of the bushes beside her.

Not only had the flesh been removed from its fur, it had also been cut into many thin pieces neatly. Only its tail was connected, revealing transparent and bright veins under the sun, like a blooming flower.

The little girl was stunned for a moment. She looked around and carefully walked over. She stared blankly at the unknown flesh.

Her stomach let out a hungry growl, reminding her that it was time to eat.

The little girl looked around carefully again and reached out with her small hand to take off the piece of flesh that had already been cut into pieces.

The height was just right, and she could get it without even standing on her toes.

Looking at the transparent and tender piece of meat in her hand, the little girl swallowed her saliva and slowly placed it under her nose to smell. A fishy smell assaulted her nose.

However, compared to before, she felt much better and no longer felt disgusted.

She used her small hand to gently tear off a piece and placed it in her mouth. She closed her eyes and started chewing.

Blood flowed in her mouth and the stench filled the air. It still made her feel uncomfortable, but she did not stop at all. After quickly chewing a few times, she immediately swallowed it.

She closed her eyes and paused for a moment. Then, she started to eat a second piece.

Then, the third, fourth…

Soon, she ate this small piece of fresh meat clean.

Her stomach was finally full.

"So it's not that difficult to swallow\!"

The little girl finished eating the meat and felt that her stomach was full and she was very quiet. She no longer felt the discomfort of having eaten raw meat previously.

However, the stench in her mouth was still not comfortable.

She walked into the orchard and searched carefully. She picked up a green and yellow fruit on the ground, wiped it with her small hand, and started eating.

The sour and sweet juice immediately filled her mouth and chased away the strong smell.

A rustling sound suddenly came from the tree.

The little girl looked up and saw a monkey eating fruits on the tree. It widened its eyes and looked down at her curiously.

Perhaps it had never seen such a white little animal.

The little girl opened her mouth and revealed her white teeth. Her eyes curved as she smiled brilliantly. She raised her little hand and waved at it, greeting, "Hey, little monkey, were you the one who helped me pluck the fruit? Thank you."

The little monkey blinked its round eyes and stared at her. It did not understand why. It threw down the remaining fruit core that its subordinate had eaten and smashed it on the little girl's head.

Then, it clapped its hands on the tree and jumped around. It cried out in joy.

The little girl cried out and rubbed her head. She looked up at it, but she was not angry. She also had bright eyes and white teeth and laughed with it.

The man and monkey smiled at each other.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped up from a fruit tree at the side and instantly landed on the fruit tree where the little monkey was standing. It bit its neck\!

The little monkey could not react in time or resist at all. Its laughter stopped and its head immediately hung down.

The little girl raised her head and the laughter in her mouth suddenly stopped. She widened her eyes and looked at the figure and the little monkey in his mouth in shock.

Chu Xiaoye bit the little monkey's throat and threw it down.

"Bam\!"

The little monkey fell down and landed in front of the little girl. The little girl was so frightened that she let out a scream and jumped up. She retreated and her face was pale.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and looked down at her. His gaze was cold and dignified. He did not feel guilty or blame himself for his actions.

"Whoosh\!"

He turned around and jumped away from the tree, ignoring her.

The little girl looked up at his retreating figure and lowered her head again. She looked blankly at the little monkey's corpse on the ground and bit her lips, tears swimming in her eyes.

Little Monkey was so cute, why did he bite it to death?

"Whoosh\!"

The figure that had just left suddenly rushed back from the ground and stopped in front of her, looking at her fiercely.

The little girl's body trembled and she shrank her neck, but she was not afraid of him. She said with tears in her eyes, "You don't eat little monkeys. Little monkeys are so cute…"

Before she could finish speaking, Chu Xiaoye turned around and cut the little monkey's neck with his claw. Then, he grabbed the little monkey's head that had died with its eyes wide open and handed it to the little girl, as if he was saying, "The little monkey is so cute. I'll let you play with it."

"Ah —"

The little girl screamed in fear again and her face turned pale. As she retreated, she waved her small hands and fell to the ground. Her eyes were filled with tears. "I don't want… I don't want…"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her teasingly and threw away the little monkey's head. He then used his claws to cut the little monkey's body into a few pieces and started biting. His mouth was full of blood and dripping sounds. He even deliberately turned his head to show her.

The little girl's entire body was trembling and her face was pale. She cried, "You… you… you baddie\!"

Chu Xiaoye grinned and looked a little ferocious. He used his claws to take a small piece off the little monkey's corpse and cut off its fur. Then, he used his claws to quickly cut the small piece of flesh into many thin pieces. The roots were not completely cut off and he threw it in front of the little girl.

The little girl stopped crying and widened her eyes, looking blankly at the familiar piece of fresh meat in front of her.

Under the sun, the pieces of flesh were transparent and tender, still dripping with blood. They were so similar to the piece of flesh she had just eaten.

The little girl's lips trembled and her mind was blank.

Chu Xiaoye threw down the little monkey's corpse and walked over with his mouth full of blood. He pushed the piece of flesh on the ground with his claws and looked at her with a burning gaze. He bared his sharp fangs and looked threatening.

"Eat it\!"

The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes. Her exquisite and young face was filled with fear and a pitiful plea.
