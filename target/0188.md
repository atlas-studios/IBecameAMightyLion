Chapter 188: Animal Mutations

Two cowards\!

When Chu Xiaoye saw this scene, not only did he not help the Chino brothers, he even rushed up and slapped them.

If they were even afraid of two hungry wandering lionesses, how could they survive with him in the future?

It would be embarrassing if news of this got out\!

The Chino brothers were stunned by his slap. Seeing his angry expression, they immediately bit the bullet and took a step forward, baring their fangs at the two wandering female lions and roaring angrily.

In the end, when the two female lions looked at them disdainfully again, the two brothers immediately could not help but take two steps back.

Chu Xiaoye expected better from them and rushed up to slap them twice more\!

The Chino brothers could only roar angrily. They glared at the two wandering female lions and let out even louder roars\!

Chu Xiaoye wished he could claw them to death\!

The two wandering female lions originally thought that the Chino brothers were the lion kings of this territory. Now, seeing that this young lion was actually beating them up casually, they immediately understood.

It turned out that this young male cub was the true owner of this territory\!

"Roar—"

They immediately bared their fangs and roared at Chu Xiaoye.

They did not even care about the two strong adult lions, let alone this brat whose fur was dry and whose mane was not even fully grown\!

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, just as they bared their teeth and roared, a figure suddenly rushed in front of them. With two slaps, they were actually sent flying\!

The two female lions fell to the ground in a sorry state. Their ears were ringing and their eyes were blurry. Their faces were burning with pain.

They raised their heads and looked at the terrifying figure in shock.

Catherine stood where they had been standing and looked at them coldly. The claws of her feet extended silently.

Just as she was about to rush up and open the stomachs of these two blind female lions, Chu Xiaoye suddenly growled and stopped her.

Catherine turned around and saw him looking at the two female lions with a burning gaze. Her heart suddenly skipped a beat. Then, she slowly lowered her head, put away her claws, and walked to the side.

Every pride was made up of multiple female lions and fewer male lions.

The female lions played an indispensable role in the survival and reproduction of the pride.

Perhaps there could be no lion in the pride, but there must always be lionesses around.

This was a newly established territory.

As for him, he was a new lion king.

This territory needed female lions, and he also needed female lions.

A pride could only reproduce and grow without end if they had enough female lions.

Hence, she understood him.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the two female lions and stared at their sloppy appearances. Then, he turned around and looked at the Chino brothers.

An ugly woman and a coward were a perfect match\!

"Roar—"

The two female lions seemed unwilling to accept this. They suddenly jumped up and pounced at him.

Chu Xiaoye did not even turn around and slapped them twice, sending them flying again\!

The two female lions landed heavily on the ground. For a moment, they were dizzy and their minds were blank. They struggled a few times and could not get up.

At this moment, they were shocked to discover that this young lion king was the most powerful\!

"Roar—"

Seeing that their boss was supporting them, the Chino brothers immediately roared angrily and rushed up. They pounced on the two female lions and pressed them down, preparing to open their mouths to bite.

In the end, just as the Chino brothers opened their mouths, the two female lions let out a roar and bit their lower lips. They were extremely fierce\!

The two brothers immediately let out a scream and hurriedly jumped up from their bodies, wanting to break free.

However, their lower lips were tightly bitten by the two female lions and they could not break free at all. They were shocked and furious from the pain and used their claws to grab the faces of the two female lions.

Seeing that they were stuck in a deadlock and would definitely not be able to separate for a while, Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and left with Catherine.

The territory indeed needed female lions.

Not only for hunting, but also to take care of the territory.

It was not only the lion's responsibility to chase away the invaders and fight them. In his territory, the female lions had to unite and fight the enemy with the lion.

These two wandering female lions were hungry, but they were still strong. Facing the two lions, the Chino brothers, they were still fierce, brave, and imposing. Clearly, they had a strong combat strength and a determined and brave heart.

The scars on their bodies were the symbol of their glory and strength.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to keep them.

In the future, they would be in charge of hunting. The Chino brothers would be in charge of marking the territory and patrolling the territory. As for him and Catherine, they would be in charge of fighting.

The division of labor was clear, and everyone was responsible.

This fertile territory was enough for more members to join.

He needed to accept more members to be in charge of guarding the territory and fighting with Catherine. Only then could he leave in peace and go back to fetch Little Curly Tail and the others.

He did not want this territory to change owners after he brought Little Curly Tail and the others over. At that time, it would be embarrassing to face his brothers', sisters', and mother's gazes.

The forest was in a mess.

Many python and crocodile corpses floated over from the river, looking terrifying.

Due to the continuous rain, the scent markers at the borders of the territory had long been washed clean. Therefore, many carnivores rushed in and searched everywhere for food.

When they saw the corpses floating in the water, they immediately started eating excitedly.

The vultures in the sky also landed in groups.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine up the tree, afraid that they would disturb these free cleaners.

If these corpses soaked in the river were not cleared away quickly, they would quickly decay and spread bacteria. At that time, the entire forest and the grass near the river would be severely damaged.

When herbivores accidentally ate the grass there and got infected with disease and were eaten by carnivores, his territory would probably not be inhabitable any longer.

For animals that lived in nature, disease was their most serious threat.

An infectious disease was terrifying.

He had once seen a record. A lioness in a pride ate animals that died of illness and was infected with an infectious disease. She often foamed at the mouth and twitched all over. In the end, in a few days, the entire pride was infected with the virus.

Soon, the pride with more than ten members, big and small, died.

After their corpses were eaten by other carnivores, the disease might continue to be spread.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye would never allow any rotten food to appear in his territory.

Not long after.

In the bushes, in the mud near the river, many carnivores and large groups of vultures were gathered.

Even the hyenas, the lions' archenemies, came after hearing the news and formed groups.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him.

When the Chino brothers heard the hyenas' cries, they immediately found a reason to escape from the two female lions. They roared with their mouths full of blood, threatening the hyenas in the bushes.

The hyenas looked at the two brothers and did not seem to be afraid. They continued to swallow the corpses floating in the water.

The Chino brothers did not dare to go over and continued to stand in the distance, roaring while feeling weak inside.

There were many hyenas and they were in the muddy water that was as deep as their legs. The two brothers could not even walk, so how could they dare to charge over and fight?

"Roar—"

At this moment, two furious roars suddenly sounded from behind them, causing the two brothers to tremble in fear. They hurriedly turned around and roared as they retreated.

The two wandering female lions ignored them and jumped past them, charging ferociously at the hyenas.

The hyenas immediately fled in panic, but they were still unwilling to give up the delicious food in their mouths.

The two wandering female lions were already hungry. Seeing so much fresh meat floating in the water, they immediately wolfed it down excitedly.

The Chino brothers froze in place and looked at them in a daze, not knowing what to do.

Should they continue to chase them away, or should they stand here and watch helplessly as they invaded their territory and ate their food?

The two brothers raised their heads and looked at their boss on the tree. Seeing that their boss was looking at them disdainfully, the two brothers immediately felt ashamed. Their hearts warmed as they thought to themselves, We must not let our boss look down on us\!

This was their territory\!

These two despicable female lions actually dared to be so arrogant in their territory\!

If this could be tolerated, what else could not be tolerated\!

They could not tolerate it anymore\!

"Roar—"

They immediately raised their necks and opened their mouths, roaring angrily\!

After roaring, they roared again\!

After roaring again, they continued to roar\!

The two wandering female lions wolfed down the food as they roared with all their might, like pianists at a banquet performing beautiful music for guests who were enjoying delicious food.

At first, the other carnivores were very afraid when they heard their roars. When they saw that they were standing in place and did not even move, they immediately ignored them and continued to swallow the food.

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

After the two brothers roared continuously for more than ten minutes, their throats were immediately hoarse and their breaths slowly weakened. Then, they turned into pitiful whimpers.

Chu Xiaoye could not bear to watch. He turned around and looked elsewhere.

These two fellows were actually his subordinates. They were embarrassing\!

This feast of delicacies lasted for a day and night before it finally ended.

When the carnivores and the swarms of vultures left in satisfaction, all the corpses in the bushes and the mud by the river disappeared completely.

The fish in the river also took advantage of this chaos to swim ashore and clean the dregs at the bottom of the river.

When all the corpses were cleared, the two female lions that stuffed themselves did not leave. Instead, they went around to chase away the other carnivores that were still lingering nearby.

They had already treated this place as their home.

The Chino brothers were indignant and roared at them from time to time in a hoarse voice to express their indignation.

Unfortunately, the two female lions ignored him and were not even interested in looking at them.

When the Chino brothers looked for Chu Xiaoye to help them, Chu Xiaoye let Catherine go down and beat them up mercilessly.

The two brothers left with swollen faces and did not dare to complain anymore. They could only continue to roar at the two female lions, pitifully lying to themselves and using their cries to maintain their dignity as lions.

As for the two female lions, they took a yard after taking an inch and started to roar at them, urging them to pee at the borders of the territory and mark the borders again.

The Chino brothers were furious. As they roared angrily, they went to pee to show that their bodies had given in. However, mentally, they would never give in\!

Five days later.

The bushes and the mud on the grass finally retreated.

Under the sun and the cool wind, the damp ground quickly turned dry.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that the grass in the bushes was already as long as his legs. The roots of the bushes and trees seemed to have swollen and become even thicker.

Some of the exposed tree roots were even thicker than his body\!

After the river receded, the herbivores gathered and started to eat the more delicious and lush grass on the grass.

Chu Xiaoye felt like he had seen wrongly. These herbivores were almost bigger than before and their limbs were much stronger.

The black antelopes with long horns were actually taller than the zebras in the past and had become extremely fierce.

When a black antelope was drinking water by the river, its thigh was bitten by a crocodile and it was about to be dragged into the water. In the end, the strong black antelope actually dragged the crocodile ashore. It lowered its head and used the sharp horns on its head to pierce the crocodile's mouth\!

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine around the grass and river and was shocked to discover that all the animals had changed.

And herbivores changed more than carnivores.

They became taller and stronger\!

Carnivores also had changes, but compared to herbivores, the changes were not so absurd.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of the blood rain that had lasted for more than half a month.

The blood rain seemed to be absorbed by the vegetation and land.

Herbivores had to eat grass every day and it would not affect them when it rained.

Carnivores did not like to hunt when it was raining and could go without eating for a few days.

Could this be the reason?

He turned around and looked at Catherine.

The fur on the little lioness's body was even smoother and her body had grown a lot. Clearly, some changes had happened during this period of time.

As for him, a tuft of golden fur grew on his neck and his body grew quite a bit. Clearly, he had also changed.

As for the Chino brothers, they had obviously changed.

It seemed that both plants and animals on this grassland had quietly changed after experiencing the blood rain.

He suddenly raised his head and looked at the distant mountain range.

The other side of the mountain might not be calm either.

"Roar—"

On the grassland on the other side of the bushes, the roars of the Chino brothers and the female lions suddenly came. Clearly, an enemy had invaded\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and immediately ran over with Catherine.

When they passed through the bushes and ran to the other side of the grassland, they saw a black mass of giant water buffaloes in the distance, chasing the Chino brothers and the female lions.

The size of those water buffaloes was not inferior to that of elephants\!

The Chino brothers were terrified by this group of terrifying monsters. As they fled in fear, they peed and looked like they were crying for their parents.

As for the two female lions, they ran to the side and deliberately split the huge water buffaloes into two groups.

Then, they quickly split up and divided the herd that followed them into two small groups.

The Chino brothers brought a large group of giant water buffaloes and ran towards the camp in the bushes, crying out for help in fear.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it and immediately turned around with Catherine and returned to the bushes.

Only in this forest would the ferocious charge of this group of giant water buffaloes be useless.
