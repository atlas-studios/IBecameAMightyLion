Chapter 452: Untitled

"Plop\!" Water splashed everywhere in the night.

Chu Xiaoye jumped into the river and immediately crawled into the bottom.

The dark river bottom was exceptionally clear in his flickering golden eyes.

Soon, he discovered a figure at the bottom of the river.

At this moment, Alisa was rolling at the bottom of the river with all her might, causing the mud to fly and become muddy. She looked like she was in great pain.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and immediately swam over.

Sensing the abnormality of the water, Alisa, who was rolling in the mud, immediately jumped up and bared her sharp fangs. She looked over with red eyes, looking rather ferocious.

However, when she saw that it was Chu Xiaoye, she was first stunned. Then, she slowly put away her fangs. Her red eyes were exceptionally dark and her abdomen was heaving violently. She did not look like she was in pain but was extremely excited.

Her face had previously been sprayed with a lot of venom by the giant spider, but it was intact and not strange.

From the looks of it, the venom seemed to have entered her body and was torturing her.

Chu Xiaoye landed in front of her and immediately gestured for her to go up first. He also clearly said, "My saliva might be able to help you detoxify\!"

However, this female cub seemed to be a little impatient. She immediately pounced on him with red eyes and pushed him to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and did not resist.

However, things did not seem to be as simple as he thought.

This female cub seemed to have lost her mind. Her entire body was trembling and her eyes were red. She pressed him to the ground tightly, and her mouth was open. She looked fierce and terrifying.

"No\! This fellow wants to eat me\!"

A bad thought suddenly flashed in Chu Xiaoye's mind.

The female cub was many times stronger than usual. Her red eyes looked like they were on fire, and her entire body emitted a terrifying aura that pressed him until he could not move\!

Although he could not smell the scent on this female cub at the bottom of the flowing river, this female cub's current appearance was instinctively familiar to a lion.

Alisa was poisoned.

The juice that the giant poisonous spider sprayed before it died might not be venom or maybe it was, but after entering her body, it became another thing that made her excited.

She washed herself at the bottom of the cold river for a long time, but it was useless. Her painful body was about to explode.

Coincidentally, he took the initiative to send himself to her.

The river flowed and the night was blurry.

A silver moon hung in the night sky, shining on the water.

The towering tree by the river swayed the leaves high up in the cold night wind.

On the thick tree trunk covered in amber mucus, a black shadow like a python slowly crawled down and quietly crawled under the tree.

At the bottom of the tree, the members of the pride were resting.

Catherine stood by the river alone, bathing in the cold moonlight. She lowered her head and looked silently at the flowing river, as if she was a stone statue standing by the river, motionless.

The little girl was sleeping in the tree hole, her exquisite face filled with tranquility.

The big black bear was also lying at the root below, sleeping.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers took the initiative to patrol the surroundings.

No one noticed that above them, a thick and long black shadow was slowly crawling down the tree trunk.

His curled head seemed to have a few antennae. As he crawled down, he swayed left and right, as if he was checking the aura below.

It crawled into a tree hole.

Little Curly Tail was sleeping inside. Because he had been frightened during the day, he was sleeping very soundly and was even snoring. The tail behind him curled into a few circles and wrapped around his head like a hat.

The black shadow raised its head and quietly climbed in, crawling in front of him.

However, they did not continue forward.

It smelled a special stench from this young lion, seemingly the smell of the poisonous spider.

Hence, it quietly retreated.

It swayed its antennae and crawled to the right, entering the next tree hole.

Mei Mei and Molly slept inside.

The black shadow paused at the entrance for dozens of seconds, as if it was smelling the aura inside. Then, it retreated again.

It continued to climb to the right and soon crawled into the third tree hole.

The human girl was sleeping in this tree hole.

At this moment, the little girl was wearing a white dress and white socks. She had the fur of a leopard on her and was sleeping soundly. Occasionally, she would laugh and talk in her sleep, as if she was having a dream.

The black shadow stopped at the entrance for a moment, and the antennae on its head kept shaking. Then, it no longer hesitated and quietly climbed in.

It crawled to the little girl's feet, followed its ankle up, and wrapped around the slender ankle first. Then, it wrapped around it circle by circle and soon wrapped around the little girl's slender legs.

Then, it continued upwards. Suddenly, many feelers appeared on its body and they were swaying gently.

She climbed up to the little girl's waist and started to wrap it silently. Soon, she wrapped it a few times around the little girl's slender waist and continued upwards.

Right at this moment, the little girl suddenly moved. She raised her right hand and scratched her neck.

The black shadow immediately stopped at her waist and did not move.

After a long time, seeing that the little girl no longer moved, it immediately started to wrap around her again.

Soon, it wrapped around the little girl's entire body and started to wrap around her neck and face. The swaying antenna at the front swayed gently in front of her mouth and nose, as if it was sucking the little girl's breath.

At this moment, the big black bear, who was sleeping below, suddenly trembled and woke up from its dream. It opened its mouth and roared deafeningly\!

The other members who were resting around immediately woke up. They thought that an enemy was attacking and immediately roared.

Little Curly Tail crawled out of the tree hole with a whoosh.

Mei Mei and Molly immediately rushed out.

The little girl, who was sleeping soundly, suddenly woke up from her dream. She immediately opened her eyes and sat up.

Her neck and mouth were a little itchy.

She raised her small hand and grabbed, but she did not discover anything.

She stood up and walked to the entrance of the cave. She opened her sleepy big eyes and looked down, wanting to see what was happening below.

The big black bear had already stood up from the ground. Under everyone's nervous and puzzled gazes, it grabbed its head and felt a little ashamed.

It did not know why it suddenly jumped up and roared just now. It was completely subconscious and could not even control itself. Now that it thought about it, it seemed like it did not do it at all.

Why did he explain?

"I saw a pair of eyes there just now. Very terrifying eyes\! However, when I roared and jumped up to chase after it, it suddenly disappeared."

The big black bear decided to lie, a very good lie.

Then, it walked quickly out of the cave in a serious manner. It stopped at that place and expressed to everyone that those terrifying eyes had appeared here.

It widened its eyes and looked terrified.

Everyone looked at him suspiciously and then at the dark bushes outside.

From the appearance of the terrifying poisonous spider today, this place was indeed filled with danger. It was not surprising that wild beasts came to peep at midnight.

Therefore, no one suspected his lie.

However, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur and the Jerry brothers patrolling around were still puzzled.

They had been standing guard and monitoring the wind and grass around them. If a terrifying pair of eyes really appeared, why did they not discover them and were instead discovered by the big black bear that was sleeping?

Facing their questioning gazes, the big black bear was a little flustered.

"I'm going to pee."

The big black bear patted its butt and left. Who cares if you believe me or not. Anyway, I saw it and saw it with my own eyes\!

"Eh? Where's Brother? Why isn't he back yet?"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were a little strange. Their brother had been out for so long, why had he yet to return? Could he have encountered some danger outside?

Although his brother was strong and did not care about ordinary dangers, the dangers here were unexpected and terrifying. He could not be careless.

Little Curly Tail immediately growled and jumped down from the tree hole with Mei Mei and Molly, running out to find them.

Catherine was also gone.

This made them feel a little relieved.

On the tree hole.

The little girl lowered her head and looked at the hole for a while. Seeing that nothing happened, she yawned and her eyes were filled with tears. She turned around and entered the hole again, preparing to continue sleeping.

Just as she lay down, her little hand suddenly touched something. She looked at it and saw that it was a curled leaf.

Her vision could already see in the night.

This leaf was slightly curled, like a sprout that had just come out of the branch. It was cold to the touch. Clearly, she did not pick it up or spread it below. Where did it come from?

...

Morning.

The sky had just lit up and it was drizzling outside.

The cave at the bottom of the tree, which was already damp and dark, was even colder.

However, at least they could hide from the wind and rain here. They did not have to worry about being drenched and trembling like before.

The members of the pride had long woken up and were looking outside with their eyes wide open, waiting for Chu Xiaoye to return.

They were already hungry. It was time to go out and hunt.

However, their king had yet to return.

The strange thing was that Catherine, who had always been by the king's side, had long returned and crawled into the tree hole alone. She looked a little down.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei had returned with her. Although they did not know what happened, they knew that their brother was fine, so they did not look for him again.

It was noon when Chu Xiaoye returned slowly.

His fur was dripping with water and his eyes were blank. He looked dejected and in a daze.

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and jumped down from the tree hole. He said to him excitedly, "Brother\! We should go out and hunt\!"

Seeing that everyone was looking at him, Chu Xiaoye was a little guilty and flustered. The absurd scenes from last night surfaced in his mind, afraid that his humiliation last night would be seen.

"I'm a little tired. Go alone."

He jumped onto the thick tree root, climbed up, and crawled into the tree hole, never showing his head again.  

Little Curly Tail raised his head and looked at them in confusion for a moment. He swung his tail and let out a low growl, ordering everyone to set off. This time, his tail brother would lead them out to hunt\!

However, all the members of the pride, including his father and mother, gathered behind Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur.

"Let's go\!"

Blue Eyes growled and walked out with the pride.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment before he was embarrassed and angry. He immediately roared at Mei Mei and Molly, "Let's go to the other side of the grassland to hunt and ignore them\!"

Mei Mei hesitated for a moment, but still brought Molly and followed behind him.

Mei Mei originally wanted to call for Catherine, but she thought of how the lioness cub, who was cold to everyone except her brother, would definitely ignore her and gave up.

The pride split into two groups and set off from both sides of the cave at the bottom of the tree towards the grassland not far away.

The leopard family of four did not go out. Instead, they hunted in the surrounding forest.

The cute violent bear mother and son, the three warthogs, and the honey badger were the same. They liked this forest a lot.

This vast and lush forest was enough to feed them. The flat grassland was not suitable for them to hunt.

The little girl was hiding in the tree hole. When she saw that Chu Xiaoye had returned, she crawled over quietly like a thief.

Her tree hole was with Chu Xiaoye's tree hole, less than two meters away.

The big black bear went to the river to fish alone.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the tree hole with his head lowered and did not move, like a stone sculpture. The emotions in his heart were surging and unpredictable.

When the little girl crawled in sneakily, he did not even look up.

Every scene from last night kept appearing in his mind. He could not forget it and was extremely annoying, as if he was deliberately humiliating and mocking him.

The dignified lion king was actually forced into a passive state and the other party succeeded with force.

How humiliating\!

Although he had long made up his mind to become a true lion, he did not want to throw a lion like this\!

What made him feel even more humiliated was that after the despicable lioness cub succeeded, she actually caught a fish and stuffed it into his mouth as a reward or compensation.

She was such a bully\!

"King, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?"

The little girl stood up and carefully walked in front of him. She squatted down and asked softly, her little face filled with worry.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her in frustration. Just as he was about to slap her, he suddenly smelled a familiar scent.

"Eh?"

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and narrowed his eyes. He stared at the little girl in front of him and sized her up carefully. He suddenly discovered a trace of amber mucus on a strand of golden hair on her neck. It was the mucus that was smeared on his fur when he climbed this towering tree yesterday\!

However, the mucus was on the tree trunk on top and was at least ten meters away from the roots here. Furthermore, the trunk of this huge tree was extremely thick. Without sharp claws, it was difficult to climb up. This little girl could definitely not climb up alone.

Then, where did this trace of mucus on her hair come from? 

Could it be that he and Alisa had rolled on the ground yesterday and left it on the ground, and this little girl had accidentally gotten it?

However, no matter how stupid the little girl was, she could not possibly put her head on the ground and dawdle, right?

Chu Xiaoye looked suspiciously at the little girl in front of him and his eyes suddenly revealed a hint of surprise.

This little girl's skin seemed to be even fairer and more exquisite than before. Under his sharp gaze that could penetrate the night, her fair skin almost turned transparent and emitted a gentle and charming luster. The white jade could not be described with words. The aura on her body and breathing out emitted a faint fragrance, as if flowers had just bloomed. It had never happened in the past.

That exquisite and charming face was white and red. It was so tender that water could be squeezed out of it. The expression between her brows also changed greatly.

The little girl's entire body suddenly emitted a special aura that was different from before. It even made Chu Xiaoye feel refreshed\!

This was… evolution?

Chu Xiaoye widened his eyes and looked at her, secretly surprised.

He originally thought that this mutation was only related to animals and plants. Now, it seemed that even humans were starting to enjoy the benefits of this mutation.

However, whether it was benefits or not, he could not conclude so quickly.

The change in this human girl was a little beyond his expectations. She looked refreshing and energetic. He could not help but drool, wanting to eat her in one bite\!

Such tender skin and such delicious meat. It would definitely be delicious when eaten, right?

"Damn\!"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked by his sudden thought\!

He immediately swayed his head and forcefully chased away the thoughts in his mind. He swallowed the saliva in his mouth. However, when he smelled the fragrance and breath of this little girl, his heart accelerated and he drooled again.

It was too fragrant\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of Tang Seng's meat.

No\!

He could not eat humans\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stood up and walked past the little girl. He stood at the entrance of the cave and took a deep breath to calm his mind.

Could it be that he had exhausted too much energy last night and was hungry?

Right at this moment, Alisa suddenly walked in with a black antelope in her mouth. She raised her head and looked at him, her eyes flickering with ridicule.
