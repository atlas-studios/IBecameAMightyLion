Chapter 448: Untitled

"Roar—"

Alisa roared angrily, unwilling to be humiliated.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye also roared angrily and told her to shut up\!

Alisa flew into a rage out of humiliation and opened her mouth to bite his nose. However, Chu Xiaoye's mouth was also very close to hers. He did not show any weakness and also opened his mouth to bite her.

Hence, the two mouths bit each other tacitly.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the others, who were still hiding at the side, widened their eyes.

"Brother, you're really good at playing\!"

Right at this moment, the human girl also clapped her hands at the side and cried out in joy, "They kissed\! They kissed\!"

Chu Xiaoye was anxious and embarrassed. He immediately hugged the lioness in his arms and started to roll towards the river not far away.

This rolling posture shocked Little Curly Tail and the others.

"You can do this?"

The little girl widened her eyes and froze in place. She felt that she had seen this scene somewhere, but no matter how she thought about it, she could not remember.

"Plop\!"

Water splashed everywhere\!

Chu Xiaoye hugged Alisa and finally rolled into the cold river.

The two sides bit each other's mouths and looked at each other, showing anger and ferocity. After staying quietly under the water for a while, they felt that the atmosphere seemed to be a little awkward.

Chu Xiaoye was the first to let go.

Alisa bit for a while longer and let go, but she still glared at him angrily.

Chu Xiaoye was thick-skinned and glared at her too.

Two lions, one male and one female, lay at the bottom of the cold river like this. They stared at each other silently.

Fish swam over, passed through them, and swam again.

She glared until her eyes started to hurt and the atmosphere became even more awkward.

"Plop\!"

Right at this moment, a sound suddenly came from above.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw a figure quickly diving down.

It was Catherine.

The little lioness was very uneasy when she did not see his figure. Even if she knew his powerful ability in the water, she was not at ease. Therefore, she jumped down without hesitation.

However, the strong and agile Ripper on the shore seemed extremely clumsy in the water and was almost washed away.

However, when she saw that her king was safe and sound, all the dangers were insignificant to her.

Before Chu Xiaoye could chase her away with his gaze, she took the initiative to float up and climb ashore.

She seemed to know what the king wanted to do.

She knew that the king was different from other lions. He always expressed rejection and shyness towards such a normal thing. Now that he had finally made up his mind, he naturally did not want the other members to watch.

She should be happy for the king, but why did she feel a little sour?

Catherine stood on the shore, her entire body wet. She looked blankly at the river under her feet, looking dejected.

Even when Mei Mei and the others came to her side, she did not seem to notice.

Mei Mei looked at her with a complicated gaze, as if she could guess her emotions.

The little lioness was alone back then. She had no home, no warmth, and no food. She was saved by her brother. She had grown up with him and had always been protected by him. She had long had deep feelings for him.

Now that everyone had grown up, her brother had become a true lion and a majestic lion king. It was time to need a lioness. She should be the first and most suitable lioness, but her brother did not seem to like her at all and never gave her any hints or opportunities.

Now, seeing her brother being so intimate with another lioness, she was naturally very sad.

Mei Mei sympathized with her and approached her. She rubbed her head against her neck and comforted her gently. "Catherine, don't be sad. Brother is a lion king. He will need many female lions. It will definitely be your turn."

Catherine slowly turned around and her expression had already recovered its usual calm and coldness. Her dark eyes looked at her meaningfully.

Mei Mei's heart suddenly accelerated under her stare and she felt a little guilty. She could not help but lower her head and say shyly, "Alright, you can tell. I also like my brother."

Little Curly Tail, who was at the side, leaned over and wagged his tail. He opened his mouth and said nonsensically, "I, Little Curly Tail, like my brother the most\! None of you are worthy\!"

Molly, who was standing beside him, twitched the corner of her mouth and glanced at him, as if she was looking at an idiot.

However, this small action was immediately noticed by Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail immediately turned around and pounced on her, riding on her back skillfully. As he slapped her butt with his tail, he roared in reprimand, "Are you secretly saying bad things about me in your heart again? You're asking for a beating\!"

Molly was already numb from his bullying. She did not dare to resist and endured it silently.

She knew this bad fellow's personality very well, but she resisted. The more excited he was, the more he bullied her. If she did not resist, he would lose interest after bullying her for a while.

However, with Mei Mei here today, he would definitely not mess around.

Mei Mei immediately jumped and slapped Little Curly Tail's head. She let out a low growl. "Brother said\! You're not allowed to bully Molly again\! Do you believe that when Brother comes back later, I'll let Brother slap you to death?"

Little Curly Tail was slapped, but he did not dare to return it. He immediately obediently jumped down from Molly's back. He even opened his mouth and grinned cheekily. He went to her side with a fawning expression, hoping that she would not complain to his brother.

"It's just playing. I'm just playing. I didn't bully you."

He turned his head and looked at Molly. He narrowed his eyes and threatened, "Right, Molly?"

Molly turned her head and did not intend to care about him. However, she thought that the king's slap was terrifying. Every time she slapped him, she could send this kid flying. In the end, she could not bear to do so. She turned around again and nodded with a cold face.

Little Curly Tail immediately became pleased with himself and winked at Mei Mei. Even the person involved said that he was not bullied, so why did he care about other things\!

Mei Mei could not be bothered with them anymore. She looked down at the river and thought to herself, Why isn't my brother up yet? When I was young, I peeped at my father and aunts very quickly.

At the bottom of the river.

Chu Xiaoye was slowly tearing his claws off Alisa's fur. Under the soaking and washing of the river, the mucus on his claws was finally diluted and not as sticky as before.

Alisa's fur hurt from being torn, but she no longer struggled or became angry. Instead, she endured silently.

Chu Xiaoye used a lot of strength and finally pulled the four claws off her fur. Then, he immediately rubbed against the soil and rocks at the bottom of the river, rubbing away the mucus on them.

Alisa obtained freedom, but she did not leave immediately. Instead, she stood at the side and quietly looked at his sorry appearance.

When Chu Xiaoye finally finished cleaning the mucus on his claws, Alisa suddenly swam in front of him. She twisted her neck and looked at the remaining mucus on her fur. Then, she looked at him with a commanding gaze. "Help me clean it up and lick it."
