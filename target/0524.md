Chapter 524: The Orcs' Encirclement

"Whoosh\!"

Vilis suddenly stood up, raised the sword in her hand, and slashed the laughing girl's face, cutting her entire face and head into two\!

Blood sprayed and the laughter stopped.

The girl finally died.

Vilis held the sword with both hands. Her face was pale and her entire body was trembling.

Fei'er and Denise seemed to have their souls suddenly sucked out. They knelt beside the Queen and did not move.

No one would have thought that such a sudden change would occur just as they came out of the elf city and had yet to walk out of the snow forest.

The queen was ambushed and a sharp dagger pierced through her heart.

This would be a huge blow to them and the entire elf race.

Chu Xiaoye came in front of the Queen and looked at the dagger that had entered her chest. His heart could not help but tremble.

"Lord Night, save the Queen, please…"

Fei'er cried.

In her opinion, this Lord Night was omnipotent. In just two days, he had healed the Queen's deep arrow wounds. This time, he would definitely have a way.

Denise looked at him too.

Vilis held the sword in her hand tightly and placed her back against it. She said with a trembling voice, "As long as you can save Her Majesty, from today onwards, I won't call you short anymore… I'm willing to do whatever you want me to do…"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and whispered, "Sorry, I'm really helpless this time."

The dagger had already pierced through her heart and blood had already flowed into her mouth. No matter how strong his saliva was, there was nothing he could do.

Lanisi raised her trembling hand and grabbed the beautiful dagger at her waist. She looked at him and begged, "Night, bring them to… find Myna. You have to… bring Myna back… This dagger was once given to me by her. After seeing it, Myna might… might…"

Blood surged out of her mouth and she could not say anything else.

A painful expression appeared on the Elven Queen's face.

Chu Xiaoye reached out and took the dagger from her waist. With a whoosh, he took it out of the sheath and placed the sharp tip of the knife against her neck, wanting to give her a quick death.

No one stopped him.

Fei'er cried non-stop.

Lanisi's eyes revealed a trace of begging, hoping to help her relieve her pain quickly.

However, Chu Xiaoye's hand was trembling.

He could not do it.

He thought of the girl's kiss on him that night and of the girl's snow-white skin and gentle appearance in a hot spring. He also thought of the soft hair that slid and caressed his body.

He looked up at the girl and slowly put away the dagger.

"Your Majesty, if you can tolerate it, I'm willing to try."

He raised his other hand and grabbed the dagger that was inserted into her heart. His eyes trembled.

Lanisi did not answer because she could not speak.

"Pfft\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly exerted strength and pulled out the dagger from her chest.

Lanisi's body trembled and blood sprayed out.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly lowered his head, opened his arms, and hugged her tightly. Then, he used his mouth to block the bloody wound.

Sweet blood surged into his mouth.

His head started to buzz and his entire body started to tremble.

At that moment, he seemed to have returned to the grassland. Under the blue sky and white clouds, he ate meat and drank blood.

It turned out that his elf body had not forgotten the smell of blood.

However, at this moment, he maintained his rationality and closed his throat, not letting the blood of the Elven Queen flow in.

Under the stimulation of blood, saliva started to flow out of his mouth.

Saliva mixed with blood and rolled in his mouth.

He took a deep breath and used all his strength to vomit the blood in his mouth back to the wound. However, the blood in the wound was already flowing out quickly and flowing down the corner of his mouth.

"Go back\! Go back\!"

He was shouting with all his might in his heart.

Suddenly, a familiar heat surged in his body and rushed up, squeezing into his mouth through his throat.

Then, the blood in his mouth was finally spat back into the wound and mixed with the blood that surged out. A stream of air rushed out of his mouth, into the Queen's wound and into her heart.

The blood mixed with his saliva seemed to have changed directions and started to flow back into the Queen's heart.

Chu Xiaoye hugged the queen tightly, his entire body trembling.

Finally, blood no longer flowed out of the wound.

However, he suddenly felt his vision turn black and he almost fainted. It was as if he had exhausted all his energy or as if all his blood had been sucked dry.

He fell limp in the Queen's arms.

The Queen, who was on the verge of death, suddenly opened her eyes again. Her originally gradually enlarging blue eyes regained their luster.

Chu Xiaoye finally could not hold on and fainted.

The dagger he took out from the queen's waist also fell to the ground. The originally cold blade suddenly lost its luster and dimmed.

Chu Xiaoye had a dream.

In his dream, he suddenly became a person, a person who ruled the world and made all men and women submit. Then, he suddenly became a lion again, a lion that made all lions and female lions submit. The scene changed repeatedly. One moment, he was a human, and the next moment, he was a lion. However, no matter what form he took, he always stood high in the most dazzling place and looked down at them and them at his feet.

He was a king, an eternal king.

When Chu Xiaoye woke up, the sky was already filled with stars.

They could not walk out of the snow forest before the sky turned dark. Instead, they hid in a snow cave.

Queen Lanisi did not die. Instead, she leaned against the corner of the wall and leaned beside him. She held the dagger that High Priest Myna had given her and was in a daze.

The snow forest was no longer the guardian forest of the elves. Orcs often appeared here.

Therefore, they could not live.

Fortunately, the moonlight was not bad tonight and the snow cave was quite bright.

Catherine hugged her huge sword and guarded the door, motionless like a statue.

Fei'er and Denise guarded beside the Queen, looking at her in a daze, as if they still could not believe that their Queen had actually returned to life.

The wound on Lanisi's chest was already bandaged and she looked quite energetic. She did not look like a person who would definitely die if his heart was pierced by a dagger.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in the dark, finding it difficult to calm down.

It seemed that even as an elf, his saliva was still useful, and the mysterious energy in his body was still there.

However, he still suspected whether these things could really revive a dead person?

"Your Majesty, are you okay?"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly said.

This sudden voice suddenly frightened the elf girls who were immersed in silence.

"Night, you're awake?"

Lanisi's voice was trembling and she could tell that she was very excited.

After Chu Xiaoye slept, he felt a little tired and did not feel any other discomfort.

"Your Majesty, your wound…"

Fei'er, who was beside him, suddenly knelt in front of him and hugged his hands. As she lowered her head to kiss him, she said excitedly, "Lord Night, can you take Fei'er as your disciple? Can you pass your saliva to Fei'er? In that case, Fei'er can save many people. As long as Lord Night is willing to take Fei'er as your disciple, Fei'er is willing to do whatever you want her to do. Please, Lord Night."

"Come, open your mouth."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said.

Fei'er was stunned for a moment, but she did not hesitate. She immediately raised her little face obediently and opened her mouth.

"Pui\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly spat on the ground at the side and said, "Alright, Fei'er, I've already passed my saliva to you. Lick it up. After you lick it up, you'll obtain my true teachings and can save many people."

Fei'er looked at him in a daze and said, "Really? Lord Night?"

"It's fake."

Chu Xiaoye did not want to tease this stupid little thing that was even more stupid than stupid. He pushed her head away with his hand and looked at the Queen beside him. "Your Majesty, did I really save you?"

Lanisi nodded and leaned on his shoulder, hugging his arm. She said gently, "Night, you've saved me so many times. I feel that you're born to be the man I'm destined to be. If we can return alive this time, Night, I hope to marry you, okay?"

At this moment, she had abandoned her dignity and pride as a queen.

After being reborn in death, she no longer had any hesitation.

The cave was quiet, as if they had suddenly fallen asleep.

Everyone looked at him in the dark, waiting for his answer.

Chu Xiaoye did not answer and asked again, "Your Majesty, are you sure that I really saved you?"

Lanisi raised the dagger in her hand and said with a complicated gaze, "There's also Myna. When Myna gave me this dagger, she once told me that she injected a very special energy into this dagger. If I encounter a person who is very important to me, that person will be able to stimulate the energy in the dagger and give me a new life. I did not believe it at the time, but now…"

Her eyes flickered with tears as she looked at the youth beside her and said softly, "Night, you're the person who's very important to me and the man I'm destined to be. You can't escape, but don't escape, okay?"

Chu Xiaoye raised his hand and took the dagger in her hand. He looked at the dim blade on it and was silent for a while before saying, "Now I believe that there is really magic in this world. Even if it's not magic, it's an energy similar to magic."

The Queen leaned against his body and leaned against her shoulder. She was as gentle as a little bird relying on a human. She no longer had the pride and dignity of a queen and said gently, "Night, promise me that you'll let me marry you, okay?"

Chu Xiaoye said impatiently, "Your Majesty, I'm talking about a very serious matter now. Do you know magic?"

The Queen looked at him with her watery eyes and said, "Night, I'm also saying something very serious now. Marry me, okay?"

Chu Xiaoye rejected cruelly, "No\! I'm a lion\!"

The Queen hugged his arm tightly and said, "Alright, I like lions. Furthermore, I can also become a lion, a female cub like Catherine."

The moment that was said, Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He looked at her in disbelief and said, "You… You know magic too?"

The Queen narrowed her eyes and suddenly opened her mouth, letting out a roar from her throat. Then, she let go of his arm, bent down, and lay in his arms. She used one hand to gently grab his chest and blinked her beautiful blue eyes. "Look, I've become a cub."

"…"

Chu Xiaoye's expression was stiff and his face twitched.

Was this a lion? This was clearly a female cat in heat\!

This scene stunned everyone.

Denise and Fei'er were already dumbfounded.

At the entrance of the cave, Vilis twisted her head. Her neck seemed to be stiff and she did not move.

The Queen's sudden change made them even suspect that this was a fake queen. The true queen had long died.

"Your… Your Majesty, please respect yourself."

Fei'er said weakly.

The Queen still lay in Chu Xiaoye's arms like a kitten. She raised her beautiful face and blinked her beautiful eyes. "What is self-respect? Can you protect me like Night and love me? If not, go away."

Fei'er was dumbfounded.

At the entrance of the cave, Vilis suddenly said, "Your Majesty, how can you be romantic at this time? The future of the elves is on you."

The Queen still looked up pitifully at Chu Xiaoye, thinking of the kitten that was asking for food. She said, "The future of the elves is not me, but Night. Only if I marry him will the elves have a future. Vilis, please help me beg Night, okay?"

Vilis:"…"

"Nonsense\!"

Chu Xiaoye reprimanded her. Just as he was about to push away the queen's body, he suddenly thought that the wound on her chest was definitely not healed yet. He could only knock her head with his finger and say, "Your Majesty, before my pride is safely transferred in, don't think of obtaining me\! Even if you forcefully obtain my body, don't think of obtaining my heart\! My heart belongs to the grassland\!"

The Queen blinked and said, "But, the grassland is green, Night."

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and closed his eyes. "I want to rest. Please get up, Your Majesty."

The Queen got up obediently, but she still tilted her head and leaned on his shoulder, as if she did not want to be too far away from his body for a moment.

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes and recalled carefully. Although they had skin contact and had kissed and seen each other, they did not do anything out of line. That night in the hot spring, he almost could not control himself and fell into her trap, but he still persevered in the end.

In other words, he did not do anything to her. Even if he did not marry her, it was natural and he should not be cursed by the world.

At the thought of this, he relaxed and decided to feign civility first and talk about it in the future. Anyway, the future was long.

"Over there\! Go over there and take a look\!"

"We have already sealed all the exits of the snow forest. The Elven Queen will never escape\! Even if she's already dead, we have to find her body\!"

Suddenly, the cries of orcs and noisy footsteps came from the forest outside. From the sounds, there were many people.

Lanisi's expression changed and she sat up.

She suddenly thought of a terrifying thing. There must be spies among the elves\!

Not long after they left, they encountered two groups of orcs before they could walk out of the snow forest. Clearly, the news had already reached the orcs before they set off.

The orcs were already prepared\!

Vilis stood up and quietly took a few steps back. Then, she slowly pulled out her sword and guarded at the front.

Denise and Fei'er hurriedly picked up their bows from the ground. They nocked their arrows and aimed them at the hole.

The footsteps of the orcs were getting closer and closer, as if they were running everywhere.

"Look over there again\! There are many caves here and underground. We have to find every place. We have to find the Elven Queen\! The General said that whoever can catch the Elven Queen can go to the Elven Camp and enjoy all the elves there for free\!"

The footsteps of the orcs became more and more hurried. When they heard this reward, it seemed that all the orcs were excited. They fought to be the first to find the Elven Queen.

"Captain, there's a cave here. There seems to be something inside\!"

Suddenly, an orc's voice sounded from outside.

Then, the footsteps of a group of orcs rushed over.

"The elves inside, listen up\! As long as you come out, I promise not to hurt you\! Whoever hands over the Elven Queen first can obtain the highest reward in our tribe—become the woman of all the warriors in the tribe\!"

"Hahahaha…"

"Little elves\! I've already seen you\! Come out quickly\!"

The orcs outside roared, threatened, and deliberately provoked them. However, there was still no movement in the cave.

"Damn it\! Seems like you want to do this the hard way\! Let's charge in, what are you afraid of\!"

An orc held a sickle-like weapon and roared as he rushed to the entrance of the cave, preparing to snatch the credit.

When the other orcs saw this, they hurriedly tightened their grip on their weapons and followed.

"Roar—"

Suddenly, a roar came from the black cave\!

Then, a colorful tiger rushed out with a whoosh and pushed the first orc to the ground, biting his throat\!

"It's the tiger\! It must be the little elves' war beast\! Kill it\!"

When the orcs at the back saw this colorful tiger, although they were afraid, they were even more excited. There were definitely elves hiding in the cave.

"Charge\!"

The orcs swung their weapons and rushed towards the colorful tiger.

The ferocious tiger roared and pounced at another orc. It opened its bloody mouth and bit his entire face\!

"Ah —"

The orc let out a miserable scream that was exceptionally sharp and loud in the dark forest of snow.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

When the colorful tiger bit the orc's face, the other strong orcs rushed up and raised their weapons, slashing hard at the ferocious tiger's head, back, legs, and tail.

After the pitiful and majestic tiger let out its last roar, it fell into a pool of blood. It still bared its fangs and revealed its killing intent\!

"Kill this animal\!"

The orcs raised the weapons in their hands and rushed up, chopping this colorful tiger into meat paste.

In the snow cave not far away, the sword in Catherine's hand was trembling.

This colorful tiger was from their Elf City and had almost become her battle beast. It had a good relationship with her.

"Captain\! Look\! There's another cave here\!"

Suddenly, one of the orcs discovered this cave.
