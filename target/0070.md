Chapter 70: The Might of the Golden Claw\!

The night grew darker.

The exhausted pride fell asleep.

The cold father also returned from the hill and returned to the bushes to rest.

The low growl of his neighbor, the Seno brothers, only lasted for a moment before they stopped.

The hot weather made their mouths dry and they did not dare to expend too much energy and water.

It was quiet in the bushes.

Catherine lay in the bushes with her eyes open. She was dizzy and could not sleep.

Mei Mei placed the deer meat in front of her.

Although she was hungry, she did not have the strength to eat.

She felt weak all over and felt her body getting hotter and hotter, her bones hurting more and more.

She felt like she was about to die.

She was sick.

Perhaps it was a disease that could make her never stand up again.

Her mother was not far from her in the neighboring territory, but she did not miss her.

Even though she was about to die, she had no intention of seeing her again.

She was just an abandoned child.

She had long lost her home and family.

Now, in her heart, there was only that figure that let her life regain hope and light.

Moonlight poured down like water.

He lay quietly on the Baobab tree, seemingly asleep.

He must be very tired today.

Unfortunately, she would never see him hunting again. She would never be able to eat the food he left behind.

Catherine's vision grew blurry.

Her body was burning hot, but her heart was cold.

Just as she was about to close her eyes and fall asleep, a figure suddenly appeared in front of her.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of her with the water bag in his mouth.

The little lioness looked sick and was seriously ill. She might lose her life.

On this vast grassland, be it adult lions or young cubs, they were all afraid of disease.

Many lions died silently from illness.

In the dry season, disease was especially prevalent.

The little lioness's body was fragile. She ate one day and went hungry the next and did not have her mother's care and concern for her. It was inevitable that she would be depressed and have poor immunity.

Chu Xiaoye was not a doctor. Even a doctor could not do anything in this situation.

He could only come over to give her some water and spit in the water.

He was not sure if his saliva could kill the bacteria in her body. He could only try.

If she could not be saved, she had to be resigned to her fate.

In this cruel animal world, life withered every moment. She was not alone.

Catherine raised her head with difficulty and widened her eyes, looking at him in a daze, as if she was dreaming.

He was here.

He had brought water to see her.

Did he know that she left?

At the last moment of her life, she was happy to be able to stay so close to him, to be able to see him so closely, and to be cared for by him.

Even if she died now, she would be satisfied.

She did not dare to look at him. She lowered her head in shame and stuck out her tongue, licking the water in the water bag gratefully and reservedly.

The water was sweet and fragrant.

A cool sensation flowed down her throat and into her body, seemingly extinguishing the hot flames in her body.

She suddenly perked up and continued to lick the water in the water bag.

Such sweet and cool water\!

Was this a psychological factor?

Perhaps, it was because he had sent it over.

Seeing that she was enjoying her drink, Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and pushed the deer meat on the ground in front of her. Then, he rubbed her head to comfort her.

He seemed to be saying, "Girl, don't be afraid. It's okay. You should eat and drink. I'll bury your corpse if you die."

Catherine raised her head and looked at him with watery eyes. She was in a daze, as if she had suddenly become stupid.

She had never enjoyed such gentleness, such an intimate gesture that made her heart race and warm up.

Her eyes trembled and she could not help but extend her head forward, wanting him to continue touching her.

But.

Chu Xiaoye had already turned around and left, crawling into the bushes at the back.

He planned to see if there were any more prey nearby.

For a sick cub, fresh meat would definitely be more nutritious and delicious.

Catherine watched his retreating figure, and her eyes gradually narrowed in drunkenness.

Her appetite suddenly increased and she seemed to have recovered some strength.

She lowered her head, drank the entire bag of water, and ate the deer meat clean.

Then, she quietly lay in the bushes and fell asleep.

The night was quiet and the moonlight was bright.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the orchard at the back and hid in the dense grass for a while. He did not see any prey.

Until dawn, they still found nothing.

It seemed that life would become more and more difficult in the future.

As for whether that female cub could survive the illness, he could only leave it to fate.

"Roar â€”"

Just as he stood up from the grass and was about to turn around and leave, a familiar roar suddenly came from the forest not far away.

It was the cry of a little leopard.

However, this cry seemed to be filled with fear. Her voice was trembling.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and walked over.

A sharp stench suddenly assaulted him, making him almost want to puke\!

In front of him, there was a thick patterned python coiled at the bottom of a big tree\!

The little leopard was wrapped around the tree trunk by the python. Although it struggled, it was useless. It let out low cries and its eyes were filled with fear.

She did not know where her mother went.

Under normal circumstances, pythons were on leopards' recipes.

However, as long as there was a chance, the python would eat the leopard cub and not show mercy\!

The little leopard had clearly been caught by the python after being alone.

If her mother were beside her, it would not dare to attack even if it was given a few more guts.

At this moment, in fear and despair, this little leopard suddenly saw the despicable cub.

She was stunned for a moment before she immediately howled in panic.

She seemed to be saying, "Save me\! Save me\!"

Chu Xiaoye circled behind the python.

The python's head immediately turned around vigilantly. It opened its mouth and spat out its smelly tongue. It looked at him coldly, as if it was threatening him.

Chu Xiaoye's mood was terrible when he thought of how he was almost strangled to death by a python when he was sleeping on the tree.

Although they were not the same, they still made him disgusted and angry\!

"Whoosh\!"

He started to circle around the tree\!

The python's body was tightly wrapped around the tree. When it turned, its movements were much slower.

After Chu Xiaoye turned a few times and saw that its reaction was too slow, he immediately lost the interest to continue playing. He waved his right claw and, with a whoosh, grabbed at its head\!

A golden light streaked across the night like a meteor\!

"Bam\!"

The python's flat and ferocious head instantly fell to the ground.

The wounds were neat, as if they had been cut by a sharp blade\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked\!
