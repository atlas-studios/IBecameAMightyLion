Chapter 374: Untitled

"Boom\!"

The kicks were like thunder and the ground trembled\!

Under Chu Xiaoye's lead, the pride rushed out aggressively. However, in less than a minute, they suddenly changed directions and fled back in panic.

The little girl sat on the tree with her eyes wide open and had yet to put down her little fist.

Her king had already taken the lead and ran back. He crawled into the bushes and jumped onto the Baobab tree. He stood beside her with his head held high and chest out, looking as majestic as ever.

The members of the pride fled back to the bushes.

Those who could climb trees went up the trees and those who could not ran deeper into the bushes.

On the grassland, the black mass of giant water buffaloes surged over like a black wave, carrying wild and violent killing intent and a terrifying aura that could destroy the world\!

There were more than 100 water buffaloes all over the grassland. Every one of them was huge and was almost comparable to an adult elephant in the past. They were at least thousands of kilograms\!

The two huge horns were like two curved blades. They were thick and sharp and stood high on their heads. When they ran, they lowered their heads and charged with all their might like a well-equipped strong army\!

They would kill anyone who stood in their way\!

Be it the rolling iron hooves or the densely packed sharp horns, they were fatal weapons to the pride. No one dared to fight them head-on\!

However, the pride had long been experienced in dealing with such a strong army of iron hooves.

As long as they fled into the bushes and used the complicated terrain to scatter the water buffaloes and slow them down, they could naturally defeat them one by one and kill them one by one\!

Chu Xiaoye stood on the Baobab tree and looked calmly at the water buffalo army approaching aggressively. He did not panic.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, and Molly deliberately let out fierce roars from another Baobab tree at the side to attract the water buffaloes.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the other members of the pride of the cold father hid.

This forest was extremely vast, and the sparse and low trees and bushes inside also grew crazily under the two rains of blood. They were already lush, tall, and thick, like a large forest.

If the water buffaloes ran in, they would definitely be separated by all sorts of trees and bushes and their speed would unconsciously slow down.

At that time, it would be the best opportunity for the pride to attack\!

However, the opportunity did not come easily.

Just as the huge water buffaloes were about to run into the bushes, they suddenly stopped in unison.

"Mooâ€”"

At the same time, with a loud moo, the huge water buffaloes immediately split into two groups. One continued to guard the bushes, and the other left to eat in the grassland not far away.

Chu Xiaoye, who was standing on the tree, immediately revealed a grave expression when he saw this scene.

The intelligence of this group of water buffaloes seemed to have improved qualitatively. Not only did they not fall for the trap of charging into the bushes, they even guarded the outside and split into two groups to eat in shifts.

Furthermore, looking at the scene, the goal of this group of water buffaloes was very obvious. It seemed that they would never stop until they achieved their goal\!

The grass here was lush and grew very quickly. It was enough for more than a hundred water buffaloes to eat for a long time.

Furthermore, they could go to other territories to eat grass.

However, what about the pride?

The gathering and mighty charge of the water buffaloes had already frightened the other herbivores. The herbivores on this territory and the animals in the bushes had all fled and disappeared.

Only the pride could not escape.

This was their territory, their soil, and their new home that they had painstakingly built. How could they abandon it so easily?

Furthermore, if they were chased out of their territory by this group of water buffaloes, how could their pride survive on this grassland in the future?

Therefore, the problem placed in front of Chu Xiaoye looked a little serious.

The water buffaloes seemed to have long understood the terrain here and knew that behind the bushes was a river. Although the top and bottom of the bushes were also grassland, they were already the territory of other new prides.

Other than that river, no matter which direction, the water buffaloes could quickly charge over.

They wanted this pride to retreat from this territory and cross the river. Or, they would guard this territory and die\!

The water buffaloes and pride were enemies to begin with. However, the situation today was definitely not simple. It was very possible that the water buffaloes were taking revenge on their former hatred. Or perhaps, the water buffaloes had already sensed how strong this pride was in advance and had to eliminate it as soon as possible.

No matter what the reason was, Chu Xiaoye knew that today's matter could not be resolved peacefully. Either you died or I died. No one would retreat.

The water buffaloes naturally would not retreat, and neither would their pride.

He had just brought the pride of the cold father over from the other side of the mountain and given them a new home. At this moment, if they fled again, they would let down his reputation as a lion king.

The noisy night quickly quietened down.

More than fifty giant water buffaloes guarded outside with a murderous aura. The other fifty were eating grass not far away.

They seemed to be clamoring. "Coward, come out if you have the ability\! Don't you feel any anger watching helplessly as we invade your territory, watch helplessly as we eat all your grass and destroy your home?"

The pride was naturally furious.

Little Curly Tail bared his teeth and roared. Mixed Fur walked out of the forest and wanted to rush out to fight, but Chu Xiaoye, who was standing on the tree, did not give any instructions.

Usually, they could move freely and not be restrained, but at this moment, it displayed the importance and absolute authority of a lion king.

If Chu Xiaoye did not give the order, no one dared to act rashly.

The members of the pride walked out of the bushes and looked up at him, waiting for his orders.

The water buffaloes had already stopped running. The terrifying hooves and iron no longer had fatal strength. If the pride rushed out, they could take advantage of the chaos to kill a few.

This way, the other water buffaloes started to panic. Then, their formation was in chaos and they started to escape. Then, they could chase after them wantonly.

The thoughts of the pride seemed very reliable, because they had learned from their previous battles with the water buffaloes.

However, they did not know that things were different now.

Although the water buffaloes had stopped running, their hooves were already fatal to lions because they were too big\!

Furthermore, not only did their speed and reaction speed not deteriorate, they looked even stronger.

Furthermore, the horns on their heads were two sharp curved blades. A random poke and stab would cause the tragedy of having their stomachs cut open.

Furthermore, their previous performance and current position were that of attacking at any time and moving together. They would not be confused by the pride's attack.

As for the formation being in chaos and escaping, that was even more impossible.

The other group of water buffaloes that had split up were paying attention to the situation here at all times.

All sorts of signs indicated that the intelligence of this group of giant water buffaloes was already many levels higher than before. They would definitely not collapse just because a few members fell.

At that time, the pride with too much difference in size would probably not even have the chance to turn around and escape again.

Chu Xiaoye would not take this risk.

Even if a member died in battle, his heart would ache. The members of the pride that he had painstakingly gathered could not fall in front of a herd of wild cows\!

Wait\! Continue to wait\!

Chu Xiaoye's silence expressed his intentions.

Blue Eyes also meant that in the current situation, he could not rush out to die.

He turned around and left, walking into the depths of the bushes. He prepared to go in another direction to see if there was still a way out.

Chu Xiaoye looked down. The other members of the pride were still nervous and waiting solemnly, looking like they could fight at any time.

He would be tired.

Chu Xiaoye growled and told everyone to lie down and continue to rest, ignoring the water buffaloes outside.

The other party was clearly very afraid of this forest and did not dare to enter.

He could just watch from the tree.

As long as the other party dared to rush in, it would be a chance for the pride.

The female lions were very obedient. Although they were still uneasy, they still lay down.

Mixed Fur and the Jerry brothers, took the initiative to walk to the grass at the edge of the bushes and lie down, always monitoring this group of giant water buffaloes.

The Chino brothers were uneasy. They could not stand or lie down, and they paced back and forth.

The cold father's mouth was still covered in blood. Clearly, he had been injured previously. Perhaps because he had just discovered that the water buffaloes had invaded the territory, he relied on the might of the pride to charge forward bravely and was sent flying by a hoof. Fortunately, his bones were surprised and he reacted quickly and fled back.

Little Curly Tail was unwilling to accept this. He still roared on the tree and let the water buffaloes come in to fight to the death. Unfortunately, the cows ignored him.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and glared at him, telling him to shut up before making him quiet down.

The members of the pride were not sleepy at all, but they no longer had the nervousness and fear from the beginning and slowly calmed down.

At least, it was safe in the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the river behind the bushes.

He hoped that some herbivores would appear there tomorrow.

Only when he was full would he have the strength and patience to continue waiting. 

No matter what, he would not give up this home and try his best to not let every member of the pride die.

The night returned to calm, but the killing intent still did not dissipate.

Chu Xiaoye lay down on the branch and prepared to sleep for a while, waiting for dawn.

After dawn, the water buffaloes' vision would change for the better. Perhaps, they would be much braver. At that time, they would easily make mistakes.

"Cooâ€¦"

A strange sound suddenly came to his ear.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that the little girl was hugging the tree trunk with a red face. She smiled at him sweetly, seemingly not afraid at all.

The soft fur of the gazelle wrapped tightly around her delicate and slender body. Her slightly curled golden hair hung loosely in front of her chest and matched perfectly with the brown gazelle skin.

The moonlight was like water, quietly flowing on her young and exquisite face. Her blue eyes were bright and beautiful like sapphire.

What a beautiful person.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but curl his tail and glare at her. He twisted his butt and gestured. "Did you fart just now?"

"Pfftâ€”"

Before the little girl could answer, he squeezed out a little fart.

A small wisp of black smoke curled up.

Although it was only a small fart, the smell was still terrifying.

A worm that was happily eating supper on the leaves behind immediately froze and fell down, dying on the spot.
