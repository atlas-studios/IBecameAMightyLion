Chapter 391: Untitled

The night was silent.

The slight noise only sounded once before it stopped.

In the surrounding forest, there was only the wind and the sound of leaves. No other sounds could be heard.

However, the next moment, Chu Xiaoye jumped up from the ground with a whoosh and shot towards a bush on the right like a bolt of lightning\!

The Jiela sisters happened to be lying beside the bushes. Before they could react, Chu Xiaoye had already brushed past them and landed in the bushes with a whoosh.

At the same time, a slender figure suddenly jumped out from the other side of the bushes and quickly flew towards the forest\!

Its speed was still very fast\!

However, just as it ran for a distance, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and landed in front of it. He raised his claws and slapped it away\!

It was a grayish-yellow fox\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the thin and short animal in front of him and was clearly stunned.

The fox fell into the grass and struggled for a few times before standing up. However, it was trembling and did not dare to escape.

At this moment, the members of the pride had long woken up and surrounded him.

"Ji Ji\! Ji Ji\!"

Right at this moment, a few strange cries suddenly came from the bushes.

The fox hurriedly turned around and called out, looking terrified and anxious.

Mixed Fur walked close to the bushes and swung its huge claws, revealing a few small furry heads inside. They were actually a nest of little foxes\!

The few little foxes cried out as they trembled, looking very terrified.

It turned out that after this fox mother settled these little foxes here, she went out to find food. When she returned at night, she realized that this place was already occupied by the pride.

Facing this group of terrifying ferocious beasts, the fox mother was terrified and helpless. She could only approach secretly and wanted to bring the children away quietly, but Chu Xiaoye caught her.

Mixed Fur looked at Chu Xiaoye and waited for his orders.

As long as it was a carnivore, they were their competitors. When they encountered the other party's cubs, they would naturally be merciless and kill them all.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the terrified and desperate fox in front of him. His tense heartstrings relaxed, but he felt a little disappointed.

He originally thought that it was that vicious and powerful enemy, but he did not expect it to be a little fox that was protected her cubs.

Just as he was thinking about how to deal with these foxes, Catherine, who was still on the tree, suddenly flew down with a whoosh and pounced at the Chino brothers at the back of the pride\!

Her movements were fierce and fierce\!

The raised silver claws flickered with a cold light in the night\!

The Chino brothers only had time to widen their eyes, but they did not have the time to react\!

"Whoosh\!"

A second before Catherine landed, a figure suddenly jumped up from the grass behind the Chino brothers. With a flash, it rushed into the forest at the back and disappeared\!

Chu Xiaoye only saw a thick tail covered in stripes. That tail was so familiar that he and the entire pride of the cold father had nightmares and could not sleep at all\!

It was a tiger\!

Catherine landed behind the Chino brothers and hesitated for a moment, not chasing after it.

She seemed to have seen through the other party's strength at a glance and felt fear.

Little Chino, who was standing at the side, felt his butt turn cold and the pain was unbearable. He turned around and was shocked to discover that his entire tail had been cut off\!

If Catherine had not discovered the tiger early and pounced over in time, his entire butt would have been cut off\!

"Roarâ€”"

At this moment, Little Chino suddenly jumped up from the ground and cried out in pain.

The pride was shocked and hurriedly surrounded him.

Chu Xiaoye ignored the fox in front of him and walked over quickly to check the wound on Little Chino's tail.

His broken tail was lying hot in the grass. It even twitched.

The tiger's claws were actually so sharp\!

Other than Catherine, no one else saw the enemy just now.

Even Chu Xiaoye only saw a familiar tail.

Therefore, Little Chino's current miserable state made the other members of the pride even more terrified and flustered.

They did not even see the shadow of the enemy before Little Chino's tail was cut off. How could such an enemy make them feel terrified?

Even the two old generals, mixed fur and blue eyes, were secretly shocked.

The strength of the enemy exceeded their expectations.

He had just come to the forest and had yet to find a place to stay when he encountered such a strong enemy. How could he live in the future?

Little Chino lay on the ground, still crying out miserably.

The mood and atmosphere of the pride suddenly became even more depressed and nervous.

The fox took advantage of the fact that the members of the pride were not paying attention to it and immediately crawled into the bushes, leaving in a hurry with the few little foxes.

At this moment, no one cared about their lives.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked in the direction the tiger left in, his eyes flickering with golden light.

On the grassland, the pride would not be afraid of any competitor. At most, they would fight and exchange their lives\!

Here, the advantage of the pride was gone.

They could not discover the enemy at all and were in a passive state everywhere. They were attacked, but they did not dare to chase, afraid that they would be ambushed again.

The dense forest and bushes with a short and narrow vision left them at a loss. They could not do anything to the enemies who were good at ambushing and proficient in this forest.

Chu Xiaoye understood everyone's worry and hesitation about their future. He was the same.

However, there was a process of adaptation at any start.

When they became familiar with the forest environment and the combat skills here, they might not be inferior to the natives here.

The current situation did not allow them to regret it.

They already had no way out and could only advance. They could only force themselves to adapt to this new environment.

This mountain was still corroded by the sea. No one knew when it would collapse.

Therefore, they had to continue forward and go to the forest further away to find soil that was more suitable for them to survive.

However, before that, he had to take revenge for Callie.

This tiger killed Callie and ambushed Little Chino not for food or hatred, but to declare its sovereignty, show off its absolute status and strength here, and chase them away.

"I'm the king here\! Wanderers who fled from the grassland, this is not a place you can stay\!"

Tigers usually lived alone. In every territory, there was only one tiger, and the members of the pride would consume a lot of food every time. Therefore, every moment Chu Xiaoye's team stayed here, the tiger would be even more irritable and angry.

Chu Xiaoye was not afraid that the other party would not come out.

If it did not come out, the pride would stay here until the food and resources in this territory were exhausted, causing the nearby herbivores to not dare to come over\!

Chu Xiaoye confirmed his plan and let everyone continue to rest. They did not have to be afraid or flustered.

Little Chino, who had its tail broken, finally quietened down and lay on the ground, feeling dejected and lingering fear.

Chu Xiaoye chewed a few leaves and smeared them on his wound.

The little girl walked over and rubbed Little Chino's head, comforting him gently.

Little Chino did not appreciate it. He swung his head and pushed the little girl to the ground.

He hated this useless little thing who only knew how to pretend to be pitiful\!

"Bam\!"

Big Chino suddenly slapped him on the head and glared fiercely at this stupid brother, waking him up.

Could this fool not see how much the king doted on this little girl?

Even Little Curly Tail and the others did not dare to bully this little girl. You fool, did you eat the guts of a bear?

Little Chino looked at him aggrievedly and did not dare to resist. He slowly lowered his head.

How could he not understand? It was just that his tail was broken. He was distracted and extremely terrified and helpless, so he could not help but be angry.

The little girl stood up from the ground and was not angry. She smiled at him sweetly and retreated to the side. She sat under the tree at the side and raised her head to look at the night sky.

A crescent moon was faintly visible.

What should she do?

Every member of the pride had their value. As for her, she had eaten and drank for so long and had been protected by the pride for so long. What should she do to repay them?

She seemed to be unable to do anything.

Her weak body had no strength, speed, or useful skills like a warthog or a honey badger. What could she do?

Right, she knew how to sing.

She only knew how to sing.

In the past, when she was sad and crying in low spirits, her mother would sing for her. When she could not sleep when she was young, her mother would also use her voice to coax her.

The ballads seemed to have a magical power that could change a person's mood.

However, would it be useful to lions?

Regardless of whether it was useful or not, she only had this small skill.

The members of the pride were all very depressed, sad, afraid, and confused. The silence made her panic.

Therefore, the little girl decided to sing a song to relieve the stiff atmosphere.

She was a little shy, and her pink face was dyed red. Her heart was beating rapidly and she felt nervous and embarrassed. However, no one here would laugh at her.

She gathered her courage and sang.

The song was childish, but it carried a tone that surprised and shocked the pride. In the quiet night and the cold forest, it flowed slowly like a stream.

Perhaps every animal could sing, but only their own species seemed to understand.

However, at this moment, the little girl's singing seemed to really have a magical charm that made all the members of the pride's heartbeats and breaths follow it, rising and falling rhythmically.

The night was quiet, and only the little girl's voice drifted in this ancient forest.

The little girl's face was red. She did not know if she sang well or if everyone liked it. She only felt that her mood suddenly improved a lot.

Little Chino, who had its tail broken, also turned its head and looked at her in a daze.

After the little girl finished singing, she smiled at him sweetly again, showing her snow-white teeth and clear eyes.

That tender and exquisite face was as warm as the spring wind and as bright as the sun. There was no fear or confusion about the future.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked in front of her. On a whim, he extended his claws and scratched the ground in front of her. "Very good\!"

The smile on the little girl's face froze and her body trembled. She suddenly raised her head and widened her eyes, looking at him in shock and disbelief\!

It was as if she had seen an alien.

It was even more terrifying than seeing an alien\!

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth and curled his lips. Then, he used his claws to scratch the ground a few more times and immediately covered the string of marks just now.

"Chiâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly let out a human-like laugh, then turned around and left, climbing up the tree.

The little girl had miscalculated.

Even here, there would still be people mocking her. However, she would never know or understand.

The little girl lowered her head and stared blankly at the blurry marks on the ground in front of her, as if she was dreaming.

No one could understand her current mood, not even Chu Xiaoye.

She suddenly left the human world and entered the animal world. She was slowly adapting to the life and environment here and was trying her best to integrate into the pride. Just as she was about to forget her identity as a human, she suddenly saw human language.

The little girl was stunned.
