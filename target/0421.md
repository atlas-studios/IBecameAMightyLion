Chapter 421: Untitled

The death of the hyena queen marked the end of the battle.

When the spotted hyenas that were already retreating saw the hyena queen fall, they no longer hesitated and immediately howled as they fled in all directions.

The cold father, who was covered in wounds, killed until his eyes were red. He roared as he chased and bit.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others also continued to hunt with the returning female lions, not preparing to let go of a hyena.

Seeing that the crisis was over, Chu Xiaoye did not stop them. The pride needed to fight and kill often to maintain their original courage and fighting spirit.

He turned around and looked at the young lioness cub that had almost drowned in the mud pit. He was quite shocked by her performance today.

Although this appearance was unfamiliar, the aura on him seemed familiar.

If this lioness had not succeeded in her sneak attack and terrified this hyena queen with her intelligence, the outcome of the battle would be unpredictable today. Even if she won, she would have to pay a heavy price.

However, although this lioness had done a great job today, Chu Xiaoye felt uncomfortable when he thought of how low-key and reserved she was along the way.

Could it be that this fellow was hiding some secret?

Seeing him staring at her with a burning gaze, Alisa immediately regretted her rash actions just now. She should have continued to keep a low profile and continued to be ordinary until she found an opportunity to chase him off the throne and replace him.

It seemed to be an opportunity just now.

If she did not help, this fellow might die or be seriously injured. Then, her chance would come.

However, at that time, more than half of this pride would be dead or injured. Then, it would be meaningless for her to take over this pride.

Furthermore, she did not want this fellow to die.

Although this fellow was despicable and his farts were especially smelly, his strength could not be underestimated. Furthermore, he was hiding secrets and improving at a godly speed. If she could take him for her own use, he would definitely be of great use to her future grand ambitions\!

Furthermore, no matter what, this fellow had saved her life back then.

The help just now could be considered returning his favor.

The next time, when this fellow completely despaired, she would suddenly make a move and make him give up his position willingly and submit to her\!

Alisa secretly planned to replace him, but she looked at him calmly without any guilt of hiding a secret.

She was secretly pleased.

This fellow probably never would have thought that the enemy that almost slapped his male symbol back then was her—the grassland queen, Alisa\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at her carefully for a while. Seeing that he could not see anything, he stopped thinking and turned around to walk in front of Belia.

Belia's mouth was broken, her jaw was tilted, and her mouth was full of blood. She was lying on the ground, looking at him pitifully with her round eyes.

Blue, his wife, and Belita also rushed over covered in blood and looked at her sadly.

Animals could only wait for death when they suffered such injuries.

For animals like them who relied on their sharp teeth to bite their prey, breaking their mouths meant that they could not eat and could only starve to death.

As her biological father, Blue had always been taking care of her carefully. Now that he saw her in such a miserable state, he was naturally sad.

The daughter was going to starve to death in front of her father. This was a tragedy between leopards.

Blue walked in front of Belia, lowered his head, and rubbed her neck gently with his head, as if he was comforting her or telling her about his failure as a father.

Belia raised her claws impatiently and slapped his head away. Saliva flowed from the corner of her mouth as she looked at Chu Xiaoye with watery eyes.

Blue turned around and looked at the young lion king, his eyes begging.

Of course, he knew his daughter's wish.

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a moment before walking in front of Belia and looking at her gently.

Belia raised her head excitedly and stuck out her neck, preparing to accept his rubbing. She even twisted her butt and curled her tail, her eyes filled with fawning.

She was expressing her love and begging for sex.

Even if she died, as long as she could be intimate with him once before she died, she would die without regrets.

Blue turned around and took a few steps away.

The female leopard nudged Belita with her head and also turned around with her.

Belita looked confused and secretly turned her head to peep.

Catherine stood at the side and watched with flickering eyes. She did not move, like a stone sculpture.

Alisa glanced at him from the corner of her eyes and turned her head away. She snorted coldly in her heart. What's so good about this fellow? Even leopards like him\! He only likes to fool around. He really can't achieve anything great\! Mating and whatnot are the most annoying\! It's better to dominate\!

The atmosphere was a little ambiguous.

Although everyone turned their heads, they were secretly looking, as if they were waiting for something.

Belia lay on the ground and twisted her waist and butt with all her might. She looked at the young lion in front of her with watery eyes and asked for sex shamelessly.

Who could bear to refuse this female leopard's last wish before she died?

Everyone turned their heads and looked at the young lion king with bated breath, waiting for him to take action.

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a while before finally taking action.

He took another step closer to Belia, his entire face almost touching hers.

Belia's breathing was rapid, and her eyes were filled with peach blossoms. She was so excited that her entire body was trembling.

"Bang\!"

Right at this moment, no one expected this young lion king to actually raise its claws and slap Belia's jaw fiercely\!

Everyone was shocked\!

Blue jumped up and prepared to stop him.

Even if you did not like to mate, even if you were unwilling to mate with a leopard, you could not kill her directly\!

Everyone knew how strong this young lion king was. With that slap, even a strong lion could not withstand it, not to mention an injured leopard.

"Crack\!"

Indeed, the crisp sound of bones suddenly came from Belia's jaw.

Under everyone's shocked and puzzled gazes, Chu Xiaoye took a few steps back, extended his claws, and hooked them at Belia. He looked at her with a burning gaze, as if he was tempting her. "Come over and mate."

Belia, who was lying on the ground, suddenly jumped up excitedly and pounced over, rolling in front of Chu Xiaoye. Then, she turned around and had her back to him. As she twisted her butt and wagged her tail, she grinned foolishly and even spat out her tongue excitedly.

At this moment, everyone was shocked to discover that the female leopard's broken mouth was actually closed\!

Blue, who was about to rush over, immediately froze in place, his eyes wide with disbelief.

Belia waited for dozens of seconds and saw that there was no movement behind her. She turned around and saw that the bad fellow had actually turned around and left after teasing her\!

"Roar —"

She cried out fiercely. Just as she was about to jump up and chase after him to settle the score, she suddenly realized that her mouth had recovered\!
