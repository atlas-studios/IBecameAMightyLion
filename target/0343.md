Chapter 343: Untitled

Two days later.

The wounds on Little Curly Tail and the others had already healed.

Morning.

Chu Xiaoye set off with the pride.

His old home was reluctant to part, but his new home was filled with anticipation.

Every member of the pride of the cold father had mixed feelings.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the forest that was growing larger and larger for the last time, as well as the two lush Baobab trees. He said goodbye in his heart.

Birth and growth were all in this territory.

Now, he was going to leave to find a wider space and a better home.

It was inevitable for most creatures to like the new and dislike the old.

No one did not want a better one. It only depended on whether you had the ability and courage to do so.

The pride walked slowly along the river.

Even when they entered the territory of other prides, they did not stop at all.

When the lion kings ran over angrily with their companions and female lions, wanting to fight to the death with these invaders, they realized that their true king was here. Hence, all their anger and killing intent instantly turned to respect and fear, and they retreated obediently.

Even the pride that did not know this young lion king was terrified when they saw the few huge lions with mixed fur and blue eyes and retreated.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye's team was unimpeded.

However, this team looked a little strange.

Other than the ferocious pride, there was also a pair of slender female leopards, a fat and healthy warthog that had abandoned its wife, and a fearless Brother Flat Top.

Furthermore, there was a human girl with golden hair and blue eyes wearing a white dress.

They set off in the morning and walked non-stop until evening.

To animals, such a difficult journey was nothing. Usually, it was even more difficult to find food during the dry season.

However, for a human girl of only seven or eight years old, this was definitely a very painful torture.

The little girl followed closely behind Chu Xiaoye. Even though she had already fallen a few times from exhaustion and was dizzy and about to faint, she still did not fall.

Because she knew that falling behind meant death.

That delicate and trembling figure was determined and tenacious. As the wild beasts of the grassland migrated, it formed a strange scene.

Chu Xiaoye did not deliberately slow down or look back at her. He did not comfort her or let her rest for a while.

Since she chose to follow them, she had to not be a burden to them.

He would never delay the migration of the pride for a strange human girl.

When the sun was about to set, the little girl fell again.

This time, the little girl struggled on the ground a few times and actually did not get up again. Her legs were extremely sore and her entire body had long lost its strength.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and led the team down the hill to drink water by the river.

After walking under the sun for the entire journey, everyone was already thirsty.

Since even he was unwilling to care about the human girl, the other members of the pride naturally did not care.

This creature was too weak for them and was not suitable for their team.

Even if it was the warthog Pit or Brother Flat Top Little Honey, they each had their own strengths and uses. They were much stronger than the human girl.

The cold father could not understand why his unfilial son did not eat her in one bite.

Could it be because they both had golden fur?

This river was relatively quiet. There were only some birds drinking water by the river, and there were no large animals.

There was no sign of the crocodile in the river.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was lowering his head to drink water with his team by the river, cries of "Ahhhh" suddenly came from the hill.

The group of annoying hyenas disappeared when the black lions wreaked havoc in the grassland. After the black lions were eliminated, they suddenly returned uninvited and appeared in large numbers.

At the same time, the trembling scream of the golden-haired little girl came from the hill.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and quickly jumped up the hill to look at the group of murderous hyenas.

There were more than twenty of them. They were circling the golden-haired girl excitedly, trying to approach her, looking very careful.

They did not seem to have seen such a strange creature with upright legs and fur.

The little girl stood there, waving her hands and chasing them away with a trembling voice. Her blue eyes were filled with tears and were filled with fear and despair.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

What made Chu Xiaoye not know whether to laugh or cry was that this golden-haired little girl suddenly mimicked the cries of those spotted hyenas and started to bark childishly. She even lay on the ground, as if she wanted to disguise herself as their own kind.

This adaptive intelligence seemed to be exclusive to humans.

The ferocious hyenas seemed to be a little stunned for a moment, but they could tell from the smell if this creature was their kind.

Therefore, they ignored her and continued to roar as they approached.

The little girl immediately stood up and retreated in fear.

The few spotted hyenas surrounding her bared their fangs and prepared to bite.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye walked over.

Although he did not roar, his striking golden mane and strong lion smell were immediately discovered by the spotted hyenas.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas immediately faced a great enemy, thinking that this young lion was here to fight them for prey.

As Chu Xiaoye approached, the hyenas surrounding the little girl immediately ran away in panic and made way. However, they did not run far. Instead, they shouted provocatively not far away.

The little girl immediately turned around and ran towards Chu Xiaoye. She fell in front of him. Her little face was pale and her eyes were filled with tears. She was clearly terrified.

Chu Xiaoye walked to her side and looked down at her. Then, he raised his head and looked coldly at the twenty-plus spotted hyenas.

A group of clowns dared to be arrogant in front of him?

The hyenas had a natural fear of lions. Furthermore, this was a lion with a dense mane that was so conspicuous.

Therefore, even though they had many dogs and were strong, they still only dared to provoke from the side and did not dare to take the initiative to attack.

This also gave them a chance to survive.

Although lions and hyenas were old enemies, Chu Xiaoye had already decided to leave this grassland with the pride, so he did not want to kill them casually.

This grassland not only needed lions, it also needed this group of cunning and ferocious carnivores.

Without them, those herbivores would reproduce in large numbers and quickly. The grass on the grassland would also be quickly exhausted and become bare. At the same time, rotten meat would be everywhere and all sorts of bacteria and viruses would wreak havoc. In the end, all animals and vegetation would probably pay a heavy price.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye ignored them and turned around, preparing to leave.

The little girl immediately followed behind him.

However, his retreat suddenly fueled the arrogance of the spotted hyenas. They thought that he was afraid.

Therefore, the hyenas immediately rushed over ferociously under the hyena queen's lead.

At this moment, the blue-eyed, mixed fur, the Jerry brothers, and the members of the pride of the cold father walked up the hill one after another and looked at them suspiciously, as if they were looking at an idiot.

It was just a group of hyenas. They did not care at all just now, so they drank the water calmly before coming up.

However, what was happening now? This group of bastards actually dared to charge over?

Were they tired of living?

"Ahhh\! Ahhh\! Ah… Ah… Oh…"

When they saw the huge Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and the members of the pride of the cold father, the twenty-plus ferocious hyenas suddenly stopped in their tracks. The arrogant "ah oh" in their mouths suddenly turned into a trembling voice, becoming smaller and weaker before finally disappearing.

"Ahhh —"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly mimicked the little girl's tone and called out to them, his voice dragging out.

This cry not only frightened the spotted hyenas, even the blue eyes, mixed fur, and Little Curly Tail behind him were shocked\!

Their king actually learned to bark like a dog?

The golden-haired little girl beside Chu Xiaoye also widened her eyes and looked at him in shock.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly blushed.

Just now, he was still a child and felt that it was fun. He subconsciously mimicked the little girl's appearance and called out. Actually, he regretted it just as he called out.

Now, seeing everyone staring at him strangely, he immediately felt embarrassed.

A dignified lion, a dignified lion king, actually learned to bark. What was going on?

In his anger, he jumped up and suddenly pounced at the hyena queen in the pack of spotted hyenas. He slapped her until her brain exploded and she flew out, instantly dying\!

"I'll let you lead the way\!"

Chu Xiaoye glared.

This scene terrified the other hyenas.

Their powerful queen was killed instantly\!

"Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas immediately dispersed and fled in fear. They tucked their tails and were terrified like stray dogs\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and turned around to look at the golden-haired little girl. Then, he walked down the hill and went to the river to drink water.

The little girl hurriedly followed behind him and came to the river. She looked at the flowing water of the river. Her mouth was dry, but she seemed to be hesitating.

In her previous life, she would never drink this dirty river water.

However, the extreme thirst made her feel terrible.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and licked the water. He looked at her reflection in the water, as if he was observing the expression on her face.

Humans who were used to living a good life could not adapt to the cruel life of animals.

Even if they could put down their dignity and image to eat meat and drink water like animals in order to survive, their bodies and the immunity in their bodies could not adapt.

Sooner or later, the disease would find them and let them know how difficult it was to survive.

Furthermore, the human in front of him was only an underage girl. She was white, tender, and delicate. Her physique was even worse.

Perhaps, before Chu Xiaoye could abandon and chase her away, she would fall behind and die silently.

Chu Xiaoye drank the water and looked at her coldly, preparing to leave.

At this moment, this delicate golden-haired little girl suddenly lay down and started to drink water in the river. Her two fair little hands were holding water, and her eyelashes were trembling as she drank greedily.

Her slightly curled golden hair fell into the water and formed a strange and beautiful scene in the river that was illuminated by the setting sun.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment, and his eyes revealed a hint of surprise.

He was a little impressed that this little girl could put down her human identity so quickly and compromise determinedly for survival.

Just as the little girl was lying by the river and drinking the river greedily, Chu Xiaoye's gaze suddenly focused and he rushed over.

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere and a bloody mouth full of fangs suddenly jumped out from the water and bit the little girl's head.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's golden claw had already slashed over\!

"Whoosh\!"

Before the water could fall, blood had already splashed out\!

The two halves of the giant crocodile's mouth were cut off by the sharp golden claws and fell into the water.

The huge crocodile fell heavily and rolled in the water in pain, instantly dying a large area of the river red.

Many other crocodiles swam over.

The little girl fell to the ground, her eyes wide with fear.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the river and brushed away the few drops of blood on his claws casually. He even stuck his claws into the water and washed them a few times.

As for the few giant crocodiles that were quickly swimming over, they were only fighting to snatch the corpses of their companions and did not come over again.

The little girl looked at the figure beside her in a daze, feeling more and more that staying by his side was the safest. She immediately got up and leaned behind him while trembling.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"Coward\! Little weakling\!"

The leopard, Belia, let out a mocking cry at the little girl.

The little girl ignored her and snuggled tightly beside Chu Xiaoye. She stared blankly at the bloody battle in the water, seemingly not as terrified as before.

From yesterday to today, she had already experienced too many terrifying and bloody things.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward along the river.

Soon, a large group of animals appeared by the river in front of him. There were hyenas, wild dogs, jackals, and other carnivores. There were also zebras, gazelles, gnus, and other herbivores. There were also rhinoceroses, water buffaloes, and other large animals.

Before the sky turned dark, they came to the river to drink water.

There were naturally many crocodiles hiding in the river.

When Chu Xiaoye appeared from afar with the team, there was immediately a commotion among these animals.

However, no one left.

When Chu Xiaoye and the others walked close, these animals panicked and made way.

However, the tall water buffaloes and the rhinoceroses ignored them. They still stood in place and even looked at them provocatively.

Be it before or after evolution, as long as they were healthy and formed groups, they would never be afraid of these lions that bullied the weak and feared the strong. They would even take the initiative to attack and trample their cubs to death.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the arrogant water buffaloes and seemed to recall the fear of being dominated by them when he was young.

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and went forward to rub against him to show that he was hungry.

Before everyone left, they had not eaten for two days. Including today, it had been three days.

At this moment, since they had encountered prey, and it was an extremely arrogant prey, they naturally could not let it go.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and prepared to take the lead and charge forward to kill the water buffalo leader.

However, just as he was preparing to charge, the little girl behind him suddenly raised her two small hands and grabbed his tail tightly.

Chu Xiaoye's expression froze and the killing intent he condensed immediately broke through.

"Bang\!"

He hesitated for a moment, but still raised his hind leg and kicked the little girl to the ground.

How could a human girl catch the lion king's tail?

He would fight whoever dared to touch his tail\!
