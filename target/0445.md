Chapter 445: Untitled

It was a little strange.

The super huge tree was adjacent to the river and was surrounded by lush bushes. Not only were there all sorts of trees and grass in the bushes, there were also all sorts of colorful fruits and fruits.

Normally, such an environment would attract many carnivores to set up camp here as their territory.

However, Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and walked all the way, but he did not see any ferocious beasts coming to chase them away, nor did he smell the border marking that was filled with a pungent smell.

Could it be that this grassland was still ownerless?

That should not be the case.

Be it grass, fruits, or water sources, they could attract many herbivores to look for food and drink water.

Such a good environment had always been a place every carnivore tribe had to fight for. However, why was this place cold and empty? They only saw herbivores hunting in groups of two or three, but no carnivores?

Something was wrong\!

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and brought the pride with him. As he walked slowly towards the bushes beside the super huge tree, he observed the surroundings carefully.

"Whoosh\!"

Not far away, a figure suddenly jumped out of the lush grass and quickly pounced at a black antelope that was lowering its head to eat grass\!

Its strong body, speed like an arrow, and beautiful patterns indicated its extraordinary identity as a hunterâ€”a strong cheetah\!

The cheetah was smaller than the leopard, but its speed was much faster than the leopard.

However, the black antelope's reaction and speed were also very fast\!

Before the black antelope could see the enemy clearly, it only heard the sound and knew the terrifying identity of the newcomer. It immediately jumped up from the ground and jumped into the distance.

The cheetah's four hooves flew like they were riding the clouds and were extremely fast. The bulging muscles and bones on its shoulders rose and fell under its beautiful fur, making it extremely beautiful. In the blink of an eye, it had already caught up to the black antelope.

Right at this moment, the black antelope suddenly stopped and changed directions, jumping towards the pride\!

This extreme operation caught the rapidly running cheetah off guard. It hurriedly stopped in its tracks and turned to chase after him again\!

Every time the black antelope jumped, it could reach more than ten meters. After using an emergency brake to get some distance from the cheetah, it immediately perked up and jumped even faster.

Usually, at this time, most cheetahs would give up.

Although they were very fast, their endurance was not good. Running at high speed was a very exhausting thing. Even if they used their last bit of strength to chase the prey, they would still be benefiting others in the end.

In the end, not only would their efforts be wasted, they would even be attacked by other predators.

However, this cheetah was clearly hungry or had a cub at home that needed to be fed. Therefore, when it saw that the distance was widened again, it still did not give up and continued to run and chase after them.

As they got closer and closer to the pride, Little Curly Tail was wagging his tail and his eyes were shining. He was prepared to take advantage of the situation to snatch food from the cheetah. As for the black antelope, it suddenly turned around and ran towards the lush forest.

In the blink of an eye, the strong and agile black antelope crawled into the dense bushes and disappeared.

When the cheetah caught up to the bushes, it suddenly stopped in its tracks and stopped there, panting. It did not chase after him again.

Although cheetahs were not as agile as leopards in the bushes, their speed and strength in the bushes were definitely much stronger than the black antelopes that entered the bushes.

The black antelope's jump completely lost its effect in this dense forest full of thorns.

If this cheetah could chase relentlessly into the bushes, it could definitely catch up to the other party.

However, this cheetah gave up now.

It stood there and panted heavily for a while. Then, it suddenly turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye and the other uninvited guests.

It did not show any fear and only slowly retreated a few steps. Then, it turned around and left calmly.

Be it lions or leopards, they could not catch it on the grassland. If it did not take the initiative to court death.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye had never thought of doing anything to it.

He finally saw a ferocious beast hunting here. The worry in Chu Xiaoye's heart finally lessened.

He looked up at the terrifyingly huge super tree that was like a demon and continued to bring the pride forward.

The leaves on the top of the super huge tree had already formed a huge green cloud that covered the entire forest, making this forest look rather dark and damp.

If the vegetation in the bushes wanted to catch some sun, they had to pray for the charity of this huge tree.

Perhaps this super huge tree was afraid of being lonely. Although it was trying its best to expand its coverage, it also left many gaps, allowing the weak companions beside it to feel the warmth of the sun.

Many colorful flowers and all sorts of unknown fruits grew in the bushes.

These plants that were still full of life in the dark and humid environment attracted many small animals to hunt.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the pride into the bushes, the little animals on the tree watched curiously with their eyes wide open. They did not flee in panic.

Perhaps they had never seen lions, or perhaps they thought that they were very safe on the tree.

Chu Xiaoye stopped Little Curly Tail from breaking the confidence of these little animals. He brought the pride and moved through the bushes towards the super huge tree standing by the river.

It was difficult to walk in the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye liked this place, but he did not like the dark environment of this forest.

Furthermore, there was a rotten smell floating in the bushes. Some animal must have died in there, but no carnivores came to clean it.

This made him feel a little strange.

Suddenly, Alisa, who was walking at the side, quickly left the pride and crawled into a nearby bush, disappearing.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat and he immediately followed.

When he crawled out of the bushes, he hit Alisa's butt.

Alisa immediately jumped away and turned around, glaring at him in disdain and anger.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and looked at the fresh corpse on the ground.

To be precise, they could not be considered corpses.

The strong black antelope from before was lying motionless on the ground with its eyes wide open.

Its abdomen was heaving violently. Clearly, it was not dead yet and there were no wounds on its body. However, its eyes were filled with fear and its entire body no longer had any strength.

After escaping from the leopard's mouth, it should have left energetically. Now, it was lying here and looked like it was about to die.

What had it experienced?
