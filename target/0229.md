Chapter 229: Escaping the Tiger's Mouth\!

"Roar —"

The male tiger suddenly threw the female tiger to the ground and opened its mouth to bite.

The female tiger struggled with all her might and bit his thigh\!

The male tiger was furious. He originally only wanted her to surrender and did not want her life. Seeing that she was still resisting stubbornly, his killing intent immediately rose and he bit her neck\!

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly lit up behind his head\!

The male tiger was experienced and immediately sensed danger. It hurriedly tilted its head to the side and wanted to roll out, but its thigh was bitten by the female tiger's teeth.

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw cut across his ear and cut off one of his ears\!

In the splashing of blood, the male tiger suddenly roared angrily. The claw that was bitten by the female tiger yanked hard and actually pulled out of the female tiger's mouth.

Just as he was about to turn around and jump up, Chu Xiaoye had already pounced forward and pierced his back with his claws\!

If the male tiger wanted to escape, its spine would definitely be cut by a claw. At this critical moment, he did not retreat but advanced. He suddenly opened his mouth and bit at Chu Xiaoye.

The bloody mouth sprayed out a stench, and its sharp fangs were covered in scarlet blood. Chu Xiaoye hurriedly retracted his claws.

"Whoosh—"

Right at this moment, the female tiger pounced forward again and hit the male tiger hard with a bang.

The male tiger was caught off guard and fell to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to pounce on him. His right claw flashed with golden light and before he could get up, it suddenly pierced into his abdomen. With a "chi", he opened his stomach\!

"Roar —"

The male tiger's roar sounded in his ears like thunder.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly jumped up and retreated.

The female tiger also rolled to dodge.

The tiger whose stomach was cut open actually bled and internal organs flowed out. It jumped up from the ground and pounced at them crazily, as if it wanted to die with them.

However, he only ran two steps before he fell to the ground with a bang. His entire body twitched a few times and his vision turned black. He died\!

Chu Xiaoye stood four to five meters away and looked at his huge body and ferocious face with lingering fear.

If not for the female tiger's draining of his strength and her final desperate bite, he might not have had a chance to approach him, let alone cut open his stomach.

This male tiger's strength was definitely the most terrifying among the enemies he had encountered so far.

Even the female tiger with terrifying strength and sharp claws was no match for him.

If not for the fact that this male tiger had designs on the female tiger and was unwilling to kill her, this female tiger would not have been able to last until now.

Lust kills.

This was the same logic for animals.

The corpses of the two male tigers lay in the snow, probably dying with grievance.

The female tiger lay at the side, panting and dripping with blood. She was clearly seriously injured and her energy was exhausted. It would probably be difficult for her to stand up.

Earlier, her motherly love had made her crazy and she did not know pain or fatigue. Now, after the danger was resolved, she immediately felt powerless and her entire body was in pain.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this was the best time to escape.

He looked at the female tiger and realized that she was looking at him too.

The mother tiger's eyes were filled with relief and love and gentleness, as if she was looking at her child.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and was a little puzzled.

"Roar\!"

The little white tiger, Luo Mei, ran over to her mother's side and licked the wounds on her body lovingly.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and prepared to leave.

If he did not leave now, when would he leave\!

At this moment, the female tiger suddenly let out a low whimper, as if she was begging.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that the female tiger's eyes were filled with tears, as if she was a human mother looking at him pitifully and begging him.

The female tiger raised her claws with difficulty and pushed the little white tiger's head, looking at him.

The little white tiger also turned around and looked at him.

Chu Xiaoye finally understood.

The female tiger knew that she would die and could not protect this little white tiger anymore. She wanted to let him bring it away.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the little white tiger and saw that it was looking at him pitifully. His heart could not help but soften. He thought that if he left like this, the little white tiger, who was not protected by the female tiger, would definitely be killed by other predators.

At that time, perhaps they would be separated and not even their bones would be left.

He flicked his golden claws and decided to do it himself. He would dig a pit and bury the mother and daughter in it, letting them die together and never be apart for all eternity.

He turned around and walked to the little white tiger's side, starting to dig at the snow on the ground with his claws.

"Wu…"

At this moment, the little white tiger suddenly whimpered and stuck out its tongue to lick his head. It looked at him with tears in its eyes, as if it was begging him.

Feeling the moisture on his forehead, Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. Then, he raised his claws and slapped her to the ground.

This was the first time he slapped her in front of her mother.

Her mother could no longer bully him\!

Therefore, not only did he want to bully her, but he also wanted to bully her mother\!

He walked to the female tiger's side and looked at the wounds on her body. Then, he stuck out his tongue and licked them.

The female tiger looked at him gently and was not angry.

Although she did not understand his intentions, she knew that he did not have any ill intentions.

The little white tiger hurriedly got up from the ground and was not angry. It went to its mother's side and licked her wounds with him.

Chu Xiaoye slapped her again, causing her to fall to the ground.

The little white tiger lay on the ground and let out an aggrieved roar, but did not dare to stand up again.

Chu Xiaoye smeared a layer of saliva on the mother tiger's fatal wound.

However, there were wounds on the female tiger's neck, face, mouth, and butt. They looked a little serious.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was hesitating about whether to be bold and touch the tiger's butt, a few terrifying tiger roars suddenly came from the depths of the forest.

The female tiger's ears pricked up and her eyes revealed joy.

The little white tiger immediately got up from the ground with an excited expression and roared at Chu Xiaoye proudly, as if it was saying, "Kid, you're doomed\! My brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts are all here\! Let's see if you still dare to slap me\!"

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her again, causing her head to tilt. She circled around in place before falling to the ground.

When the little white tiger raised its head in a daze and was about to beg for mercy, it saw that the figure had already disappeared in front of her like the wind and rushed to the foot of the distant hill.

She was stunned for a moment and hurriedly stood up. She stared blankly at the figure that was quickly disappearing into the distance until it completely disappeared from her vision.

She stood in place, not knowing what to do.

At this moment, a group of tall adult white tigers ran over aggressively from the forest.

Dora looked at her daughter with flickering eyes.
