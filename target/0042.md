Chapter 42: Little Curly Tail

"Bam\!"

But.

Not only did his brother not praise him, he even slapped his head again\!

Little Curly Tail tilted his head and looked at his brother in confusion.

Could it be that he accidentally provoked his brother?

Chu Xiaoye's face was cold. He raised his claws and pretended to want to continue slapping him.

Little Curly Tail immediately jumped up and ran towards his mother with a wronged expression.

He seemed to be saying, "Mom, Mom, Brother is so rude, violent, and difficult to please\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and slowed down, waiting for Xi'er and Mei Mei.

This kid was stupid.

Walk slowly, pretend to be tired, and wait for Mei Mei and her mother to catch up. Then, you could walk slowly together.

By lying on the ground and not leaving, you are blatantly challenging Father's authority\!

Furthermore.

Since you want to do a good thing, you have to do it all.

You have to take care of Aunt Xi'er's feelings and dignity. If you lie down and wait for her, she will feel terrible.

Of course.

This was just Chu Xiaoye's wishful thinking.

Little Curly Tail would definitely not understand this.

Xi'er might not understand either.

However, after spending some time together, he knew very well that many animals were much smarter than humans thought.

Their emotions, status and identity, their family system, their management of their territory, and even their attitude towards enemies were extremely similar to that of the first humans.

"Roar—"

Seeing that he had fallen behind, the lion immediately growled, its eyes filled with coldness and anger, as if it was urging him.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at him and immediately pretended to be panting and exhausted as he continued to walk slowly.

If he lay down like Little Curly Tail did just now, the lion would have already rushed over and slapped him.

In this animal world, where only the fittest survived, sympathizing with the weak would only implicate the entire tribe and make them weaker and weaker.

The lion looked at him coldly and quickened his steps.

He needed to drink water.

Callie, who was pregnant, was also in a hurry to replenish her water.

The three female lions and Lars followed closely behind him and walked towards the river at the foot of the hill.

Aisha brought Little Curly Tail and stopped in place, waiting for Chu Xiaoye, who fell behind.

The lion glanced at them and ignored them, leaving coldly.

Seeing that he had gone far, Little Curly Tail turned around and ran to Chu Xiaoye's side. He circled around him and roared.

He did not believe that his brother could not walk anymore.

His brother's strength and energy were the most powerful among his siblings. He was many times stronger than him.

His scream seemed to be saying, "Is brother for real, is brother for real\!"

Chu Xiaoye was dizzy from his spinning. He glared and curled his tail. Before he could turn around and aim his butt at him, Little Curly Tail immediately fled with a whoosh and ran behind his mother to hide.

Aisha stood in place and looked at him, then at the lion and the three female lions that were gradually disappearing into the distance. Her eyes were filled with anxiety.

Without the lion leading the way, how were they to drink water later?

The river was filled with danger.

Chu Xiaoye knew how worried she was. However, if they did not wait for Xi'er, the mother and daughter would be killed by some carnivores before they could reach the river.

He could not be so selfish and cold for the time being.

Mei Mei walked to his side and rubbed her head against his body, as if she understood why he was walking so slowly.

Xi'er walked with difficulty, looking at him gently with her remaining eye.

Two female lions and three young cubs walked slowly on the grassland. Without the lead of the adult male lion, they walked towards the dangerous river.

Along the way, Xi'er rested three times.

During this time, they also encountered a group of wild dogs looking for food. There were about twenty of them.

Seeing that Xi'er could not move freely and that there was only one healthy adult lioness beside her, the wild dogs prepared to take the opportunity to bully her and show their might.

In the end, before they could surround him, Little Curly Tail shot out like an arrow that had left its bow. He rushed into the pack of wild dogs and bit the head of a wild dog\!

The other wild dogs immediately panicked and fled\!

Although wild dogs were like hyenas and fought in groups, their size and bite strength were far inferior to that of hyenas.

As for courage, it could not be compared.

Hence, in front of Little Curly Tail, they were just younger brothers.

However, it was obvious that Little Curly Tail did not have any experience in hunting enemies.

When the wild dogs were frightened by his ferocity and fled in all directions, he immediately loosened his mouth and put down the wild dog in his mouth.

The wild dog's mouth was filled with blood as it lay on the ground motionless.

Just as Little Curly Tail was turning around to show off to Aisha and Chu Xiaoye, the wild dog lying on the ground suddenly jumped up and turned to escape\!

Little Curly Tail was dumbfounded.

His embarrassment turned into anger. Just as he was about to continue chasing, Aisha hurriedly called him back.

However, he seemed to feel that it was too embarrassing. He ignored his mother and still chased after the escaping wild dog angrily\!

In the end, he had just taken a few steps when a strong wind suddenly blew from behind him\!

A figure shot over and slapped him on the head, causing him to fall to the ground\! 

Little Curly Tail ate a mouthful of dust in a sorry state. Just as he was about to jump up and roar, he suddenly saw a familiar face\!

"Wu…"

His angry roar immediately turned into a whimper and he looked very wronged.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him coldly. He turned around and walked towards his mother.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment before he immediately understood. He hurriedly got up, lowered his head, and followed him back to his mother's side obediently.

He did not listen to his mother, so his brother wanted to beat him up.

But.

He did not know that other than this, Chu Xiaoye was also angry at his stupidity and rashness.

He was not wrong to enter the wild dog pack alone to kill them. He could catch them off guard and immediately deter the other hyenas.

However, he should not have given chase afterwards.

Even a rabbit would bite when it was anxious.

If he chased too far and was ambushed and surrounded by their tribe, he would be beaten and bitten to death even if he had three heads and six arms\!

This kid still had to be taught a good lesson.

This was to prevent him from becoming overconfident and dying because of that\! 

He was thinking about teaching Little Curly Tail.

His mother, Xi'er, and Mei Mei looked at him in a daze, wondering why he caught up to Little Curly Tail who was running in the distance with a whoosh\!

Furthermore, he slapped the strong Little Curly Tail to the ground\!

Was this speed wind or lightning?

This strength, was it a water buffalo or an elephant?

On a hill not far away, a herd of strong water buffaloes appeared. They had probably just gone to drink water and were preparing to leave.

Aisha immediately brought them around the herd.

Water buffaloes were very strong and not to be trifled with.

They would take the initiative to attack the pride and kill the cubs with their sharp horns and heavy iron hooves.

However, at the thought of going to the foot of the hill to drink water later, she was worried without the lion leading the way.

They hoped that the lion, their king, would still wait for them by the river.
