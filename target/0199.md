Chapter 199: The Lion King's Submission

"Chi\!"

Little Curly Tail's sharp claws cut open the hyena's open mouth and extended behind its neck to its tail\!

He stopped behind the hyena.

The hyena roared and turned around. It looked at him with scarlet eyes and suddenly lowered its chin. Blood flowed out of the cut the sharp claw made\!

A mangled wound appeared on its mouth to its tail\!

However, it did not scream or escape. There seemed to be no fear in its blood-like eyes.

It still pounced forward.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment. He suddenly turned around and swung his tail like a divine dragon. The curled tail behind him suddenly straightened and slapped his face, sending him flying.

On the other side.

Mei Mei had already cut open the hyena's abdomen and its intestines flowed out.

However, the hyena still pounced at her ferociously.

The two spotted hyenas no longer seemed to be in pain or fear. Even though they were injured, they still attacked crazily.

While Little Curly Tail sent the hyena flying, he followed closely. Just as he landed, he bit its throat\!

The hyena struggled for a while before it completely stopped breathing.

As for the hyena whose stomach had been cut by Mei Mei, blood flowed all over the ground as it died from shock.

Although the two hyenas had been killed, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei still had lingering fear.

They had never seen such hyenas.

Be it personality or appearance, they were greatly different from ordinary hyenas.

Little Curly Tail looked up at the grassland outside the border.

Now, animals had mutated and plants were growing crazily. The entire grassland seemed to be in chaos.

He wondered if his brother was okay.

He could not feel at ease without his brother around.

Three days later, rain fell again.

The rainwater turned into a normal color this time and only lasted for two days.

Chu Xiaoye paid attention to the river at all times.

The river water flowed peacefully, and no more riverbed flowed out. No strange sea creatures attacked again.

On this day.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was resting on the Baobab tree, the roars of the Chino brothers suddenly came from the border.

Then, the roars of the Jiela sisters also sounded.

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed over with Catherine.

It turned out that when the neighboring pride was chasing a strong water buffalo, they had broken into their territory.

The Chino brothers, who were patrolling the territory, immediately issued an alarm.

When Chu Xiaoye and Catherine arrived, the Chino brothers and Jiela were roaring at the pride formed by three lions and more than ten female lions.

The territory could not be trespassed and sovereignty could not be violated\!

At this moment, even the always timid Chino brothers were roaring angrily and not backing down.

The territory of this pride bordered their territory and the territory of the blue-eyed lion king. It belonged to another super pride.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine had seen the three lions and ten-over female lions.

Last time, Catherine trespassed their territory to hunt and killed two female lions and disfigured a male lion. In the end, Chu Xiaoye brought her back. The two sides had already become enemies.

This pride was only a branch of the super pride and was stationed at the border all year round.

Now, he suddenly barged in, probably not just to accidentally barge in while hunting.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them carefully and immediately understood.

The three lions and ten-over female lions had also mutated in the rain. Their bodies were now taller and stronger than before. Therefore, they wanted to take revenge?

One of the lions had half its face covered in scars and looked ferocious.

At this moment, he was staring at Catherine with hatred. Clearly, he still remembered how she disfigured him that day.

Seeing that Chu Xiaoye and Catherine had arrived, the Chino brothers roared even louder, looking like they were ready to pounce on them and risk their lives.

The three lions looked at them and saw that they were also tall and strong. Thinking of the abnormal strength of this young lion and the female cub that day, they immediately felt a little guilty.

The female lions behind them relied on the fact that they had many members and became much stronger. They were not afraid and continued to bare their fangs, roaring and unwilling to retreat.

Their two sisters were killed by Catherine. Therefore, they had to take revenge on this ferocious lioness cub today\!

Catherine did not look at them. Instead, she turned around and looked at her king.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and was about to take the initiative to attack and teach them a lesson when a low growl suddenly came from the grassland not far away\!

Then, the tall and majestic blue-eyed lion king rushed over aggressively with a pride formed by more than twenty lions and female lions\!

His thick wine-red mane and huge and strong body all displayed his ferocious and powerful aura as a lion king\!

They crossed the border and entered Chu Xiaoye's territory. Then, they came to Chu Xiaoye's side and bared their fangs at the pride next door, letting out a deafening roar.

The three lions and more than ten female lions in the neighboring territory immediately peed their pants in fear. They did not hesitate anymore and immediately turned around and fled\!

They were stationed at the border all year round and naturally knew this blue-eyed lion king.

This blue-eyed lion king was an existence on the same level as their king. Its strength was extremely terrifying and was definitely not something they could provoke.

And the other party's super pride was even stronger than their entire pride.

However, they never would have thought that this super pride was actually in cahoots with this pride\! No wonder that female cub and male cub dared to be so bold\!

However, what they did not expect was that after they left, the huge and famous blue-eyed lion king actually lowered its noble head and chose to submit to the young lion in front of so many subordinates.

For a powerhouse who had been famous for a long time, only a stronger person could make them submit willingly.

To the blue-eyed lion king, the young lion king in front of him was not only stronger, he had also saved his life and the lives of his children\!

The twenty-over lions following behind him formed a pack. There were only eight adult female lions, and the rest were his children.

That night, after he was treated by this young lion king, when the sky was about to brighten, he suddenly felt that his wound was no longer so painful. He immediately left without saying goodbye and returned to his territory to find the pride.

Because he knew that once he died, the adult lions in the pride would kill his children.

Fortunately, he returned in time. Before the lions could attack, he killed them with lightning speed.

He occupied the pride again.

At the same time, he chased away the ten-over female lions that had betrayed him, leaving only the eight adult female lions that had been taking care of the cubs in the camp.

After a few days of recuperation, the wounds on his body had already recovered. What surprised him and made him thankful was that the wounds on his legs had healed and he was no longer limping.

Ever since his hind leg was broken, he thought that he would be a cripple for the rest of his life. Unexpectedly, he actually revived from the dead overnight and healed his leg.

Therefore, he was not only respectful of this young king's strength, but also grateful.

Without him, he and his children would have long lost their lives.

Therefore, he decided to bring the pride and submit to this young king and give him all the territory.

Today, when he heard the roars of the Chino brothers and knew that an enemy had invaded, he rushed over with the pride without hesitation and prepared to fight.

Of course, he would be a little unwilling to give up the throne. However, he knew that the grassland was undergoing a huge change. There would be more and more experts like him in the future. Only a lion that was stronger and had more room to grow could protect this territory and his pride.

And this young lion in front of him was the best choice\!

He had to recognize reality.

However, he was still a little uneasy.

Would this young king, like other lions, kill the young cubs after occupying the pride?

Therefore, before submitting, he had to understand this problem.

This time, he brought the young cubs over to see their reaction.

The blue-eyed lion king lowered its head to express its submission. At the same time, it was secretly observing this young lion king to see if he was willing to let his children survive.

If he was unwilling, he would rather abandon his territory and leave with the cubs.

In the past, he would definitely not give up his territory and survival for the sake of cubs.

But now, he already had many more feelings for his family in his heart. Before the storm, these feelings were even clearer.

He would never watch helplessly as his children died miserably in front of him.

The atmosphere seemed a little awkward.

Chu Xiaoye looked at him but did not accept his submission. Instead, he raised his head and looked at the female lions and young cubs behind him.

Those young cubs could not be considered cubs anymore.

The youngest was even larger than Catherine. The oldest, a young male lion, had inherited his father's size. He was larger than the Chino brothers, but only two years old.

Most of these young cubs were more than a year old and were older than Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the eight female lions again. They were all strong, tall, and strong.

He knew that once he accepted this pride, these female lions and young lions would be his in the future. He could do whatever he wanted with them.

However, now was not the time.

He had to bring Little Curly Tail and the others over first before continuing to expand the pride. Otherwise, once he was injured or fell into a dangerous situation, these strong young lions would immediately become the most unstable factor.

Just like that night the blue-eyed lion king was suddenly attacked by its pride.

Animals' loyalty was the most unreliable\!

Furthermore, he had saved the blue-eyed lion king, not this group of young and impulsive lions.

How could they suddenly become subordinates after being master willingly?

This territory was theirs to begin with.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye would not consider these for the time being.

He growled and looked at the blue-eyed lion king in front of him, letting him bring his pride back to his territory.

The blue-eyed lion king raised its head and looked at him in surprise, clearly in disbelief.

He had come to surrender, bringing with him a strong pride and a vast and fertile territory. Shouldn't this young lion king be extremely excited and accept it without hesitation?

"Roarâ€”"

Seeing that he was still not leaving, the sisters immediately roared and walked over, glaring at him fiercely.

Catherine flicked her claws with a cold gaze.

This was their territory\!

As long as their king did not welcome them, no one could dream of staying\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the young lions.

There were lions and female lions inside. They had blue eyes, were big, and had very good genes.

At this moment, their gazes were wild and unruly. They looked angrily at the roaring sisters, as if they were preparing to pounce on them and bite them at any time.

Obviously, they did not respect this weak pride, nor were they willing to become servants like their father.

The two-year-old young male lion had a sparse burgundy mane on his neck. Just like his father, he was mighty and strong.

At this moment, he bared his fangs and looked fiercely at the sisters, roaring provocatively.

However, as he growled, his father, the blue-eyed lion king, had already turned around and pounced over. He suddenly slapped him on the head and slapped him to the ground with a bang\!

He bared his fangs, shocked and angry, but did not dare to resist.

The blue-eyed lion king swung its claws and was merciless. It slapped him in the face and roared angrily, as if it was teaching him to shut up\!

The young lion's face was covered in blood. He could only close his mouth in fear, but he looked at Chu Xiaoye with even more hatred.

He did not understand why his father lowered his head to this country bumpkin who was even weaker than him\!

No matter how powerful the other party was, how could he resist their pride?

When the blue-eyed lion king turned around and walked towards Chu Xiaoye, the young lion got up from the ground and continued to bare its fangs at Chu Xiaoye, its eyes filled with resentment and provocation.

It was as if he was saying, "Kid\! Don't think that I'm afraid of you just because you have my father's support\! Come over if you have the ability. Let's fight?"

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly jumped out from behind Chu Xiaoye and passed by the blue-eyed lion king, pouncing on the young lion\!

The blue-eyed lion king was shocked. It hurriedly turned around to stop him, but with a "chi", the figure had already flashed past his eldest son\!

Before the young lion could react, he suddenly felt a chill in his abdomen. He did not even feel any pain. A stream of blood shot out of his abdomen with a puff\!

Then, with a whoosh, the internal organs in his stomach fell out\!

He stood frozen in place, twisting his neck and lowering his head. He looked blankly at the large patch of blood on the ground and the intestines in the pool of blood.

"Bam\!"

He fell to the ground, his eyes wide open in death.

Catherine slowly turned her head and looked at the other young lions. Her sharp right claw was still stained with scarlet blood.
