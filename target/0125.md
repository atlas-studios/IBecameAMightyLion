Chapter 125: Decision

"Whoosh\!"

Under Chu Xiaoye's meticulous guidance, Catherine started to practise diligently.

Although her actions were a little clumsy and comical, she soon grasped the trick.

Her archery was becoming more and more accurate\!

The warthog digging the pit in front of him dug faster and deeper.

Only in this way could he protect his life.

Seeing that Catherine was having fun, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately came over. They were extremely excited and were eager to try.

Chu Xiaoye did not stand on ceremony and chased them away with a slap.

This was not for playing\!

This was an unorthodox method. Now, it was only used to deal with the ferocious tiger with abnormal strength. It could not be used as a survival skill in the future.

If he was used to playing, he would be doomed.

He continued to train his muscles\!

Under Chu Xiaoye's strict supervision, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei could only continue to practice those strange actions from before.

From today onwards, they had to train tirelessly every day.

Only by improving every day could he face the increasingly complicated grassland environment in the future.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Catherine's shots became more and more accurate and her movements became faster and faster\!

As for the warthog, it had already dug deep and could not be seen. One could only see mud flying everywhere in the pit.

Chu Xiaoye admired this pig's diligence.

He decided to let it go in the future and leave it in the camp. It would continue to be a slave and he would let it live well until it died of exhaustion.

The threat of that ferocious tiger had yet to be resolved and it would attack them again at any time. Therefore, they had to eat their fill.

Be it working or fighting an enemy, they could not starve.

If they wanted to eat, the cold father and the female lions naturally had to eat as well. He could not let them watch helplessly.

Although he was very worried about the amount of food on the tree and letting the pride become lazy, he had no choice but to let Mei Mei climb up the tree to get food.

He could only think of other things after he eliminated this threat as soon as possible.

Mei Mei also looked hungry, but she did not dare to make the decision on her own. After hearing Chu Xiaoye's orders, she immediately went to get food excitedly.

Seeing the dried prey fall from the Baobab tree, the cold father and the lionesses quickly stood up excitedly and hurriedly ran over to snatch it.

The cold father's roar was filled with the dignity and deterrence of a lion again\!

For a piece of food, the four female lions actually bared their fangs and started fighting the cold father.

Then, the four female lions turned hostile and started biting and fighting each other. It seemed like they had a deep hatred for each other.

Especially Maya, who had children that needed to be fed.

At this moment, she was exceptionally fierce. She bit whoever she saw and was merciless\!

When Mei Mei saw this scene, she hurriedly took another prey from the storage room and threw it down.

The cold father roared, picked up the prey in his mouth, and turned to run.

Chu Xiaoye walked back from the bushes and looked at the four female lions who had turned against each other. His heart skipped a beat. He hurriedly raised his head and gestured for Mei Mei to continue throwing the prey.

It seemed that they were really hungry.

His actions would probably make them more and more greedy and selfish.

When lions were hungry, they could hunt together. Not only could they sharpen themselves and train their cooperative skills, making the pride stronger, but they could also strengthen their relationship very effectively.

The food that they obtained without any effort brought them nothing but laziness, relaxation, selfishness, and even more greed\!

Chu Xiaoye increasingly felt that he was not actually helping them when he came to this pride. Instead, he was quietly changing the habits and rules they relied on to survive. From this, he would affect the survival and reproduction of the pride in the future.

It looked good in the short term.

However, in the future?

For the first time, he started to doubt himself.

He raised his head and looked at the distant grassland.

Perhaps, the one who was expelled from the territory by the cold father should not be Lars, who had the personality of most lions. Instead, it should be him, who looked very outstanding but was always interfering with the normal development and survival of the pride.

"Roar\!"

Just as he was in a daze, Mei Mei bit a piece of meat and placed it in front of him.

Chu Xiaoye returned to his senses and lowered his head to look at the prey on the ground.

He realized that he was getting hungry faster and faster, and his appetite was growing exponentially.

Some time ago, half a warthog was enough.

Now, an entire warthog was not enough.

He knew that his body was different from other lions. The stronger he was, the more energy he would need to expend. The amount of food he would need to eat would be even more terrifying.

He needed to grow up and fully integrate the energy in his body. Therefore, he could not always starve.

However, this pride, this territory, and the food and resources here were clearly not enough to support his growth.

This grassland was becoming more and more restless.

He had to become stronger as soon as possible in order to resist foreign enemies and protect the pride.

The pride of the cold father and the two newly born cubs could not all migrate together.

Most lionesses on the grassland stayed in the same pride from birth to death.

They were unwilling to leave or give up the territory and home they were born in.

Even if this home was not friendly to them.

Then, what should he, a cub who thought he was very smart, do?

The sun was like a fire, tormenting his confused and conflicted heart.

He raised his head again and looked into the distance.

He was afraid.

However, he had no choice.

This should be a sign of maturity.

Perhaps, there was still a blue sky, a green grassland, and a group of stronger prey waiting for him to conquer.

He was a male cub who was going to become a lion king\!

How could a small piece of land restrict his dreams?

Dream on\!

After eating, he walked into the distance and lay in the bushes alone. He was in a daze and felt very depressed.

After the female lions ate and drank their fill, they lay in the grass to rest. Their faces and bodies were covered in the scratch marks of their sisters.

Qiqi and Nunu were still full of energy. They played and fought in front of Maya, feeling carefree and happy.

Chu Xiaoye stared blankly at the scene in front of him for a long time.

Then, he suddenly got up and walked towards the bushes at the back, his eyes flickering with a determined light.

He had to kill that tiger\!

He could not delay any further\!

The warthog was still working hard to deepen the trap.

Little Curly Tail lay sleepily at the side to supervise. When he saw him coming, this kid immediately got up and started pretending to exercise.

Catherine bit her bow and climbed onto a big tree at the side. After carefully choosing a spot, she immediately tied the bow to it with Mei Mei and continued to practice diligently.

Chu Xiaoye walked towards a patch of grass and reached out with his claws to push aside the grass, revealing a sharp knife.

This time, he had to make it never return\!
