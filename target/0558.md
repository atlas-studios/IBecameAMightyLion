Chapter 558: Fighting Humans\!

"Stop\!"

When Chu Xiaoye walked to the door of the inn, the soldier guarding outside immediately reprimanded him and looked at him suspiciously, "What are you doing?"

Chu Xiaoye pointed inside and said, "I live inside. Previously, there was too much alcohol and it was too noisy, so I went out to walk. I'm back to rest now. The boss knows me. I only came to the store tonight."

The soldier sized him up and said, "Go in. Someone is dead inside. Don't run around."

Chu Xiaoye walked in quickly.

When he walked up the stairs, he heard the two soldiers guarding the stairs whispering.

"It's a few elf girls. They're very beautiful. Hehe, we're lucky this time. Captain will definitely take the opportunity to bring them away for questioning, and thenâ€¦"

Just as they said this, they suddenly realized that Chu Xiaoye had walked in front of them and immediately closed their mouths.

At this moment, Lanisi and Fei'er were standing at the door of the room, talking to a man who looked like an officer.

"Two ladies, someone was stabbed to death in your room. According to the scene, that sword is in the hands of your companions. Therefore, you have to return with us to be interrogated. I can get someone to help carry the two unconscious ladies over. Please make way."

Lanisi still blocked the door and said with a cold face, "That person is wearing black clothes and has a face covered. He's clearly in cahoots with those bandits. We also lost a companion. I hope you can send people to help find him. Before all our companions return and wake up, sorry, we can't leave here."

The man frowned and said with a serious expression, "Whether they are accomplices or not, we can only decide after checking. Since they died in your companions' room, the fundamental rule is that you have to return with us. You are elves and might not understand the rules here. The murders happening here are under our control. Please follow the rules here. Otherwise, I won't be polite anymore."

At this moment, Lanisi and Fei'er did not wear headscarves and their sharp ears were already vaguely visible.

The other soldiers beside him watched intently, their eyes burning as they gulped non-stop.

If not for the fact that there were other people watching in the inn, they would have long taken action and forcefully abducted him.

Such supreme-grade elves were rare even in those few big cities.

Lanisi still stood at the door and did not give in.

She could clearly feel the malicious gazes of these human soldiers.

This made her extremely disgusted and terrified.

"Hmph, in that case, don't blame us for being impolite\!"

The officer snorted coldly and pulled out the knife at his waist. He said with a cold face, "Two ladies, you're hindering the law and don't dare to go back with us to be interrogated. It might be related to those bandits and conspiring to kill the dead. Now, I'll bring you back for interrogation\!"

His words were righteous and were for the others living in the inn to hear.

Lanisi also pulled out her sword.

Fei'er carried her bow and pulled out the dagger at her waist.

"Lanisi, what's wrong?"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly pushed aside the soldiers beside him and asked loudly as he walked over.

When Lanisi saw him, her nervous expression clearly relaxed. She blinked and winked at him, telling him that these soldiers had ill intentions towards them.

"Who are you?"

The officer asked with narrowed eyes.

Chu Xiaoye walked over and said, "Sir, I'm their man. I just went out because of something. May I know what happened here?"

"Their man?"

With that said, Chu Xiaoye immediately felt the murderous aura around him.

The officer snorted coldly and said, "Since it's their man and he was not here just now, you should be one of the bandits\! Men\! Bring him back and torture him, let him tell us where the other bandits are hiding\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Before the two soldiers beside him could attack, Chu Xiaoye flipped his wrist and suddenly stabbed forward with his dagger. With a puff, it pierced through the armor on the chest of the officer in front of him and pierced into his heart\!

"Go in\!"

He shouted at Lanisi and Fei'er, then immediately pulled out his dagger and rushed into the room.

"Captain\! Captain\!"

"Kill him\! He killed the captain\!"

The soldiers were shocked and immediately roared as they rushed in.

Unexpectedly, Chu Xiaoye entered the room and did not escape. He pulled out his sword and guarded the door.

The two soldiers who rushed in first saw a cold light flash in front of them. With a whoosh, blood splashed and heads fell to the ground.

The soldier following behind was shocked. Just as he was about to raise the waist knife in his hand, Chu Xiaoye swung his sword again and cut the two waist knives into two\!

"Lanisi\! Fei'er\! Jump down from the window with Denise and Vilis\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted towards the back as he swung the sword in his hand and guarded the door. Otherwise, a soldier would rush in.

In the blink of an eye, two more soldiers fell into a pool of blood.

Seeing how fierce he was, the soldiers were terrified. They only dared to roar outside the door, but did not dare to rush in again.

At this moment, Lanisi carried Denise and Fei'er carried Vilis. They immediately jumped out of the window at the back.

Chu Xiaoye knew that the outside world was already surrounded by these soldiers. He had to kill his way out as soon as possible before the other party's reinforcements arrived\!

"Whoosh\!"

He swung his sword again. After forcing back the soldiers outside the door, he immediately turned around and rushed towards the window at the back. He jumped out and jumped to the ground.

"Go to the horse shed\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted at Lanisi and Fei'er and immediately ran towards the horse shed first.

At this moment, the soldiers had already rushed out of the inn and rushed over.

"Night, there's a back door there\!"

Lanisi suddenly pointed at the back of the inn.

The back door there was used for delivering food and slop from the inn. At this moment, the door was half closed and not locked.

Chu Xiaoye rushed into the stable and found his warhorse. He immediately let out the few warhorses.

Lanisi and Fei'er first placed Denise and Vilis on the horse, then they rode up and grabbed the other two warhorses.

"Let's go through the back door\!"

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and walked in front.

"Where are you running to, thief\!"

"Here\! Here\!"

The back door was suddenly kicked open from the outside. A soldier rushed in and the other soldiers prepared to enter.

Chu Xiaoye rushed up at lightning speed and swung the sword in his hand, sending the first soldier's head flying.

The soldiers following behind immediately turned pale when they saw this scene. They hurriedly retreated and shouted, "Here\! The thief is here\! Come quickly\!"

The soldiers that ran out of the inn roared and swarmed over.

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed out from behind with Lanisi and Fei'er.

Outside the back door, more than ten soldiers were guarding it. When they saw them coming out, they could only roar and rush up together.

"Whoosh\!"

The bowstring vibrated and Fei'er's arrow shot out, hitting a soldier in the eye\!

The soldier let out a scream and fell to the ground, covering his eyes and rolling.

Chu Xiaoye swung the sword in his hand and rushed towards the soldiers. The bowstring in Fei'er's hand rang again.

"Night\! Get on the horse\!"

After charging out of the defense of more than ten soldiers, Lanisi shouted.

Chu Xiaoye immediately got on the horse and ran towards the alley where Doya and Catherine were.

The human soldiers behind him chased out and ran messily to the horse shed to hold the horse, preparing to continue chasing. Someone hurriedly informed the army stationed outside the town.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes were red from killing. Seeing that there were soldiers blocking in front of him again, he charged over\!
