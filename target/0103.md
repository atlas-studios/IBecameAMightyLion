Chapter 103: Catherine's Illness

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, two figures suddenly rushed out of the bushes\!

They were like lightning that instantly arrived\!

"Roar—"

Mei Mei roared angrily and suddenly jumped up, pouncing ferociously at the hyena that was biting Little Curly Tail\!

The other hyenas hurriedly retreated\!

At this moment, another figure pounced over quickly like a cannonball and suddenly hit the head of a female hyena with a bang\!

The female hyena was sent flying and fell heavily to the ground. Its head broke open on the spot and it died\!

The other hyenas beside them did not dare to stay any longer after seeing this terrifying scene. They roared in fear and hurriedly fled\!

However, the figure did not intend to let them go\!

"Whoosh—"

Catherine rushed out like a storm and suddenly swept into the hyenas\!

She bit the neck of a hyena and jumped up with the hyena in her mouth. She suddenly grabbed the back of another hyena and tore off half of its flesh\!

The hyena let out a miserable scream and fell to the ground, rolling around.

Catherine jumped up and pierced her claws into its soft abdomen. She suddenly dug out its intestines\!

She did not stop at all. Her two claws pierced into the chest of the hyena in her mouth again and she opened its stomach\!

The two hyenas died on the spot\!

Her eyes were red like a bloodthirsty killer in the night. Her figure flashed and she shot out, continuing to pounce on the other hyenas\!

In less than a moment, the ten-over hyenas were all killed by her and lay on the grass not far away. Not a single one was left\!

Most of their corpses had broken chests and internal organs all over the ground. They were extremely miserable.

Catherine's eyes were blood red and her entire body was covered in blood. The internal organs of a hyena were still on her claws.

She stood not far away and looked fearfully at the figure lying on the ground, trembling.

She thought that he was dead.

As for Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, they widened their eyes and looked at her in shock.

This was the first time they had seen such a terrifying side to this female cub\!

The cold father, who was marking the territory nearby, also heard the noise and ran over.

When he saw the hyena corpses and internal organs all over the ground and the ferocious expression of the female cub, his heart immediately turned cold. He froze not far away, his stomach trembling.

Little Curly Tail moved his body with all his might and climbed down from his brother's body. He leaned against him tightly with a dejected expression.

Mei Mei reached out and rubbed her brother's head anxiously. She let out a whimper, as if she was calling for him.

Catherine stood in the distance for a long time before slowly walking over.

Her eyes turned as black as the night, deep and mysterious. She quietly looked at his tightly closed eyes and feet full of blood.

She did not know what happened to him, but she could tell that he must be in pain.

She would rather that the pain was on her.

They guarded here until the sky turned dark.

When Chu Xiaoye woke up from his sleep and opened his eyes, he saw a pair of dark and beautiful eyes staring at him in a daze.

He was shocked.

Catherine lay in front of him and saw that he was awake. She hurriedly stood up and seemed to be surprised, excited, and embarrassed, as if someone had discovered a shameful secret of hers.

She immediately took a few steps back and did not dare to be so close to him again.

She was extremely happy, and her dark eyes were filled with bright light.

She lowered her head and quietly retreated into the distance. She continued to hide in the grass like in the past, feeling inferior and happy as she secretly looked at him.

She was covered in blood, dirty, and in a sorry state.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw Little Curly Tail sleeping soundly beside him.

Mei Mei lay on his other side and fell asleep.

Not far away, the cold father was lying there and yawning lazily. Seeing that he was awake, he only glanced at him indifferently and continued to look at the distant grassland.

The air was filled with a strong smell of blood.

The grass around them was full of hyenas' corpses.

They were all protecting him silently.

A warm current flowed through Chu Xiaoye's heart. He lowered his head and looked at his feet.

The two golden claws that had finally grown out were already broken from the flesh and landed there.

He had already forgotten the pain at that time.

He only remembered that he was an older brother at that moment. He had to do what an older brother should do.

It was worth it to exchange two claws for Little Curly Tail's life.

Even if it happened again, no matter how powerful his claws were or how important they were to his future survival, he would still not hesitate to use them to exchange for Little Curly Tail's life.

What dogshit animal instincts and survival of the fittest were all farts to a brother\!

He was a lion, an animal, and at the same time, an older brother. He was also an older brother who had yet to completely escape the feelings of humans.

He could not be as cold-blooded and heartless as other animals.

It was indeed very difficult to survive.

However, he would rather live short and warm than live long and cold.

After all, he had once been warm.

A hot wind blew.

A cold crescent moon rose into the night sky.

There was a faint pain on his hind legs.

He turned around and saw that the human arrow was still stuck in the muscles of his right leg.

If he could not pull it out in time, it would be troublesome.

He looked at Little Curly Tail beside him, then at Mei Mei, and finally at Catherine, who was hiding in the grass in the distance.

He endured the pain in his foot and stood up. He looked at the lioness cub and raised his right palm to hook at her.

He seemed to be saying, "Hey, little girl, come over quickly."

Catherine immediately stood up and looked at him excitedly and suspiciously.

Is… is he calling me?

Chu Xiaoye could not help but bare his fangs at her and glare at her fiercely.

This female cub was indeed well-built and simple-minded\! What was the use of having so much strength? Could she not even understand this little movement?

Come over quickly\!

Catherine finally understood and ran over.

She seemed to suddenly feel that her running movements were definitely not good. She immediately stopped running, lowered her head, and walked elegantly.

Chu Xiaoye was furious.

When she walked close, Chu Xiaoye immediately endured the pain and turned around. He pointed his butt at her and waved the leg with the arrow in it, signaling her to quickly help pull it out\!

Catherine was stunned for a moment and seemed a little embarrassed, but she still leaned her head over and rubbed his butt gently.

She was so happy\!

Even Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail did not have this honor\!

Every time those two fellows wanted to take advantage of their brother, they would be kicked away by their brother\!

Now, her brother actually took the initiative to let her rub against him\!

How happy\!

"Bang\!"

Just as she was squinting and rubbing against him with a look of enjoyment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his other leg and kicked her face without any mercy\!

This idiot\!

I asked you to pull the arrow out. Why did you take the opportunity to rub my butt?

Crazy\!

Catherine was kicked to the ground and her face was burning with pain.

However, she raised her head and looked at this figure in obsession, her heart filled with admiration.

Brother Ye was so powerful\!

Even though he was injured, he was still so strong\!

Brother Ye was great\!
