Chapter 577: The King's Fury

The night returned to calm.

Chu Xiaoye also stopped.

The two brothers looked at each other silently. Even the air seemed to have become quiet.

"Roar â€”"

Little Curly Tail suddenly wailed, jumped down the tree, and rushed over\!

His strong body and lush mane did not have any dignity or ferocity at this moment. There was only his pitiful grievance and resentment.

Just like when he was young, Little Curly Tail pounced forward. As he wagged his tail excitedly, he let out cries, as if he was crying about something.

Then, he went behind his brother and stuck out his tongue excitedly and fawningly.

"Bang\!"

Just like when he was young, Chu Xiaoye raised his hind legs and kicked him to the ground.

Little Curly Tail jumped up and could only lean to his neck again and rub and lick it with all his might, continuing to let out cries of grievance.

He was now much shorter than Chu Xiaoye. His originally strong and tall body suddenly looked like a little thing.

His dignity and pride as a lion king had long disappeared. He had completely become a little licker who wagged his tail and swayed his head.

"Brother is so big\!"

He thought to himself, but he secretly looked below his brother.

Chu Xiaoye was a little impatient from his lick. He glared and raised his tail, pretending to twist his butt.

Little Curly Tail's expression changed drastically. He hurriedly jumped up and retreated\!

His brother's original big smelly fart was already very terrifying. Now that he had become so big, a big smelly fart could probably push him into the sky\!

As for the stench, there was no need to mention it. Just the thought of it made him feel disgusted.

Little Curly Tail immediately changed his target and pounced at Catherine. He stuck out his tongue excitedly and wanted to lick her.

Catherine was slightly smaller than him and stood not far behind his brother. She looked small and cute.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, he pounced close and Catherine swung her claws, slapping him in the face and causing him to fall to the ground mercilessly\!

Catherine looked at him coldly, not caring about their past relationship.

Little Curly Tail got up and cried out in grievance, as if he was saying, "Alright, I know. Only my brother can lick you."

Then, Little Curly Tail grinned again with a mocking expression, as if he was saying, "However, Brother won't lick you. Continue to be arrogant and delusional\!"

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out impatiently.

He only saw this kid now. Where were the other members?

Little Curly Tail immediately ran to his side and prepared to lead the way.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked in the direction of the towering tree in the distance.

Little Curly Tail immediately understood. The excitement on his face disappeared and his eyes turned heavy. He roared.

A human came and set fire to the tree, taking away what was on the tree and destroying the underground cave. He was still chasing them.

Chu Xiaoye understood.

They could have fled very far away to escape the pursuit of humans, but they were afraid that he would suddenly return. Therefore, they found a new place to hide nearby. Little Curly Tail would come over to check every few days and leave marks.

Chu Xiaoye let out a roar and asked if his mother and the other members were okay.

Little Curly Tail did not seem to understand and only cared about walking in front. He quickened his steps, as if he was afraid of something.

Chu Xiaoye's heart sank. He did not ask further and quickened his steps.

Before long, a patch of sparse bushes appeared in front of him.

In the middle of this sparse forest, there was a small hill full of rocks. On it were strange rocks, bushes, and thorns.

When Little Curly Tail brought Chu Xiaoye and Catherine close, the two lions suddenly jumped down from a big tree at the side and looked at the huge monster behind Little Curly Tail in bewilderment.

Qiqi and Nunu were already half-grown and did not know this huge creature anymore, but they still vaguely remembered its scent.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to greet them, a figure suddenly rushed out of the cave and ran towards him excitedly.

Aisha, his mother.

Aisha rushed in front of him and rubbed the mane on his neck affectionately. Her eyes were filled with tears.

Chu Xiaoye's heart was warm. He lay down and rubbed his head with her.

Now, he was too big. He had once looked at his majestic mother, but now, she actually seemed so small and weak in front of him.

Xi'er, who only had one eye left, ran over from the cave and rubbed his body affectionately.

Molly also walked out.

Qiqi and Nunu's mother, Maya, also came out of the bushes at the side.

Maya was hiding there just now and was the first to see him. She was terrified and did not dare to act rashly, because she could not recognize the former lion king in front of her.

He was too big and strong\!

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground and greeted them in a unique way that lions did, but he looked at the cave not far away.

Where was Mei Mei? Where was the cold father?

Where were Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and Pit?

However, after a long time, no other members came out.

Could they have gone out to hunt?

Chu Xiaoye stood up and looked at Little Curly Tail and then at his mother.

Impossible. The cold father could not have gone out to hunt.

He suddenly had an ominous feeling.

Little Curly Tail came in front of him and lowered his head, finally telling him everything.

After he left, a huge change happened here.

The humans came and ruined the environment here. They started to catch the animals here and would come again almost every few days.

The animals here were decreasing, and their environment of survival was becoming crueler and crueler.

The cold father and Mei Mei had been captured by humans. Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the other members wanted them to move away and leave this troublesome place. However, a few members of the pride of the cold father insisted on staying here and waiting for him to return.

Seeing that the food was decreasing and the situation was becoming more and more dangerous, in order to continue living, Blue Eyes and the others left one after another to find their lives.

Now, only a few members of the pride of the cold father stayed here and struggled bitterly.

Chu Xiaoye's heart was filled with guilt and anger when he heard all of this.

It was not anger at those who left, but at humans.

Blue Eyes and the others were right to leave. Their animal survival instincts would also urge them to leave. The more members gathered here, the faster their food would be exhausted and the more dangerous it would be. If they were all waiting here, they would have long been wiped out.

Chu Xiaoye naturally would not blame them.

If he wanted to blame someone, he would only blame himself. He would blame his selfishness and rashness and blame himself for not bringing them away with him.

He could not understand.

Now, humans could not save themselves. Otherwise, they would not have retreated to the grassland. But why did they still have to go against animals?

Could it be that until now, they still bullied the weak and feared the strong? In their endless fear, they slaughtered a weaker animal to find that trace of comfort and happiness?

Chu Xiaoye would not give up on Mei Mei and the cold father.

No matter what, he had to find them, even if he had to find their corpses and bones.

Towards these unforgivable humans, he swore that he would never show mercy again\!

He was no longer human and had nothing to worry about.

Many of those so-called humans had already lost their humanity. Although they were wearing human clothes, they carried the hearts of demons.

They were not worthy of being humans\!

Chu Xiaoye's chest was filled with anger. His golden mane fluttered in the night wind, and his flickering golden eyes no longer had any mercy.

It was not for killing, but to survive.

They only wanted to live simply, that was all.

Since those humans did not want them to live, they could only wait to welcome his anger\!

He wanted to let those upright beasts, who had nowhere to go but still did evil, understand who was the true king of this grassland\!
