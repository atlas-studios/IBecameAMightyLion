Chapter 76: Komodo Dragon

"Boom\!"

Just as the two prides were about to fight, the elephant herd that had just fled in panic suddenly turned around.

Under the leadership of the lead elephant, the elephants raised their noses and let out angry rumbling sounds as they charged over aggressively\!

The entire forest seemed to be trembling.

The pride of the cold father and the Seno brothers' pride did not dare to stay any longer after seeing this scene. They hurriedly brought their prides and turned to flee.

The other carnivores that were watching not far away also fled in panic.

The furious elephant herd was like a rolling torrent, its momentum vast and unstoppable\!

They chased away these carnivores and stopped in front of their dead companion. They stood in a circle and surrounded it. The group mourned.

The cold father brought the pride and fled into the bushes.

Be it him or the four female lions, they all seemed worried.

The Seno brothers' pride were blatantly provoking them with their arrogance and rudeness and did not take them seriously.

Usually, two neighboring prides would never step into each other's territory.

As for the Seno brothers' pride, they had just snatched a patch of their bushes. Now, they were invading their territory unrestrainedly and snatching their food. They completely ignored the rules\!

Obviously, the other party was bullying them on purpose because they had two lions and their pride was strong.

Furthermore, they were coveting their territory\!

Although the battle had not started and the Seno brothers' pride had retreated, they would never let the matter rest.

Especially during the dry season when food was scarce.

Whoever had the largest territory had the most food and resources. Only in this way could they ensure the survival of the pride.

The female lions of the Seno brothers' pride were pregnant and needed more territory, food, and resources urgently.

Hence, the brothers' provocation today was only the beginning.

In the future, there might be an even greater crisis that would descend on the pride of the cold father.

The cold father walked in front in silence. No one could guess his mood at this moment.

The female lions followed behind him dejected and worriedly, their gazes still looking for the prey around them.

The dead elephant would be protected by its companions for many days. In fact, its corpse might even be divided by the elephant herd and brought to a distant place to hide it.

They were hungry and could not wait any longer.

At this moment.

The sun had already risen.

The temperature on the grassland increased quickly.

The air was filled with a hot aura that made their mouths dry.

However, they had to hunt.

"Coo, coo, coo…"

At this moment, a few beautiful feathered pheasants suddenly jumped out from the bushes beside them. They flapped their wings in panic and wanted to fly away.

A figure suddenly jumped up high from the bushes and bit a pheasant that had already flown up before landing on the ground.

This commotion frightened the pride that had just calmed down from running.

It turned out that the figure was Little Curly Tail.

He vigilantly discovered the pheasants hiding in the bushes and immediately sneaked over. That was why they had witnessed the scene just now.

He caught a wild chicken and ran back to the team. He walked in front of Chu Xiaoye and stuck out his neck, signaling him to eat.

Everyone had eaten a few bites of elephant meat just now, except for his brother. He was afraid that his brother would go hungry.

Actually, everyone was very hungry.

Although the pheasant did not have much meat, every member of the pride was drooling.

The cold father's gaze was cold and dignified.

He was the king of the pride. He wanted his wife and children to understand the rules.

Chu Xiaoye opened his mouth and took the pheasant from Little Curly Tail's mouth. Then, he walked to the front and placed the pheasant that had its neck bitten off in front of the cold father.

He was not afraid of this father, but he knew the heavy responsibility on his shoulders.

The pride still needed his protection to survive.

A pride could not live without an adult lion.

The health of an adult lion directly affected the survival of the pride.

Perhaps he only needed to pee a few times and spread his scent to scare away many wandering lions wandering around the borders of the territory. That would save the pride a lot of trouble and danger.

He was indeed qualified to be the first to eat.

Those who were not in his position did not understand his responsibilities.

Chu Xiaoye might not have understood it in the past, but now that he was growing up and thinking about how he would become a lion with such a heavy responsibility in the future, he naturally understood.

The cold father looked at him coldly, seemingly surprised. However, he did not think much of it. He immediately lowered his head, bit the pheasant, and started to eat.

Lars stood at the side, drooling.

The pheasant quickly entered the cold father's stomach.

However, he was still very hungry.

The pride continued to move through the bushes, looking for other prey.

Chu Xiaoye's heart was a little heavy.

He originally thought that this place only had grasslands and animals. The beauty and cruelty were already far away from humans.

However, he did not expect to see them again today.

As for those humans, they were the nightmare of all animals on the grassland—the poachers\!

A mighty and strong elephant, the most invincible existence on the grassland, fell almost without being able to resist.

It was just because it had two ivory teeth.

Humans killed for their benefits. Sometimes, they even killed for fun.

They had already occupied all the resources and benefits on Earth. Why were they unwilling to let go of such a beautiful grassland?

Could it be that they did not know how difficult it was for every life here to live, how wretched they were and how pure and lowly they were?

They only wanted to live.

Chu Xiaoye's mood was terrible and complicated.

He was once a human but now he was a lion.

Therefore, he was both angry, sad, and helpless.

However, since nature had created these creatures, would it really watch helplessly as they were destroyed by another type of creature?

When the moon is full, there will be losses and when the water is full, there will be overflowing.

He believed that the nature that created all of this would not stay silent forever.

Storms and tsunamis, heavenly lightning and earthly fires were just a small warning.

He hoped that they could wake up and restrain themselves.

Of course.

He was only a lion now. He only wanted to survive, grow up, and live this life that he had regained.

He would let nature take its course.

"Roar—"

The cold father's roar suddenly sounded in front of him.

A crocodile-like animal crawled in front and stuck out its scarlet tongue.

The cold father had never seen it.

However, he instinctively sensed danger.

Aisha and Xi'er recognized this strange animal.

When Xi'er was injured and they went to the river to drink water, they encountered this animal, but there was no conflict.

This was a Komodo Dragon, a creature that should not have appeared in this grassland.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to the front of the team and stared at the Komodo Dragon in bewilderment.

Humans appeared.

The Komodo Dragon that did not belong here also appeared.

Was it deliberately brought here by humans, or was it forced to migrate because of the destruction of the environment?

Regardless of the situation, it was not optimistic.

"Whoosh—"

This giant lizard actually charged towards the pride\!

The thick mucus in his mouth was dragged all over the ground, emitting an extremely smelly and disgusting smell.
