Chapter 484: Dragon Flame\!

"As I said, there's only one spot."

The next day, the snow continued.

The little girl rode the big black bear and looked back at Catherine, who was no longer hiding behind. She said seriously.

Chu Xiaoye also looked back helplessly.

He was indeed touched by the female cub's persistence and loyalty, but it would also trouble him.

This girl's stubbornness had already made him give up on persuading and stopping her.

Because he knew that it was useless.

Seeing that he did not have any reaction, the little girl could only shrug and say, "Alright. She will regret it."

Chu Xiaoye was silent.

He knew in his heart that she would not regret it, no matter how terrifying the price was.

Three days later.

The distant snow mountain still looked so far away, as if it had never shortened the distance.

The white horizon was like the end of the world. It did not look far, but it was far away, as if it was a day that could never be reached.

The snow on the ground became thicker and a thick layer of ice started to appear.

The lush grass was covered under the snow, but it did not lose its vitality. It was still full of life, waiting for the day it broke out of the ice.

The temperature fell even lower.

The big black bear stopped on a frozen river and started to cut the ice and fish skillfully.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to catch prey to fill his stomach, Catherine, who was good at understanding the king's intentions, had already dragged a newly killed black antelope over and placed it in front of him.

Before he could refuse, the female cub turned around and left. Soon, she dragged back another cub.

The little girl sat on the snow at the side and clicked her tongue. "King, you have already evolved into a pretty boy who eats soft rice."

With that said, he also took out his knife and leaned over.

No one would have thought that there was a huge crocodile five meters long hiding under the thick snow.

The big black bear, who was fishing in the ice cave, had its front leg bitten by the crocodile. It was so frightened that its eyes widened and it roared, its entire body trembling.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to rush over to save her, the little girl suddenly shouted, "Tibbs\! Where's your courage?"

Tibbs immediately stopped screaming and suddenly roared angrily. He opened his mouth and bared his sharp fangs. With a crack, he actually bit through the giant crocodile's head\!

"Boom\!"

Tibbs yanked upwards with his claws and actually pulled the giant crocodile out of the ice cave, causing it to fall heavily to the ground.

The giant crocodile twisted violently a few times before roaring.

Tibbs pulled out his bloody claws from its mouth. He trembled in pain, but he did not dare to roar again. He immediately placed his injured claws in the ice water under the hole, hoping to ease the pain and stop the blood.

The little girl praised him for the first time. "Tibbs, you've become smarter."

Chu Xiaoye wanted to remind him that he could not\!

"Roar—"

A miserable roar came from Tibbs's mouth again\!

The claws that Tibbs had extended into the ice cave were bitten by the second giant crocodile\!

Blood spread in the water and the water spread out. The giant crocodiles hiding under the ice surrounded them.

Tibbs was shocked and furious. He used his brute force again and suddenly pulled the second giant crocodile out of the ice, causing it to fall heavily to the ground.

The giant crocodile was dizzy from the fall and let go of its teeth.

Tibbs pounced forward and raised his other huge claw. With a bang, he slapped its head and smashed it into pieces, causing blood and brains to splash everywhere.

The giant crocodile died on the spot\!

However, more giant crocodiles suddenly rushed out from under the ice. They fought to be first and were densely packed\!

Some giant crocodiles were fighting for the corpses of their companions, while others rushed towards the big black bear, Chu Xiaoye, and the little girl.

The little girl cried out in fear and hurriedly got up to hide behind Chu Xiaoye.

This was like poking a hornet's nest.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye protected the little girl behind him. His golden claws danced and instantly cut the heads of the two giant crocodiles that pounced over.

However, more giant crocodiles rushed over.

The black antelope on the ground that had just eaten a few bites quickly became food for these giant crocodiles.

Chu Xiaoye protected the little girl and retreated as he killed the giant crocodile. He watched helplessly as his food was snatched away.

The big black bear fell into the encirclement of the giant crocodiles. Although it was fierce, its fists could not defeat four hands. Soon, it was flustered and was bitten all over.

"Tibbs\! Transform\!"

At this moment, the little girl suddenly ordered loudly.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he looked up.

Indeed, just as the little girl finished speaking, the big black bear's hair suddenly stood on end. Its body expanded and was twice as big as before. The fangs in its mouth were revealed like sharp daggers, and its face was ferocious and terrifying\!

"Roar—"

It suddenly roared and swung its claws like a huge hammer, as if it was being assisted by a god. It hit them from all directions, causing the giant crocodiles that weighed nearly a ton to fly everywhere and be covered in flesh and blood\!

Soon, the ground was filled with the corpses of those giant crocodiles.

However, there seemed to be a lot of giant crocodiles gathered under this ice, and they looked like they had been hungry for a long time.

The strong smell of blood and movement outside stimulated them.

More and more giant crocodiles crawled out of the growing hole.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was retreating as he fought, the little girl suddenly jumped onto his back and shouted, "Tibos\! Run\!"

Then, she grabbed the short golden fur on Chu Xiaoye's neck with her two little hands and clamped her legs on Chu Xiaoye's stomach, shouting, "Go\!"

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to throw her down to feed the crocodiles, if she was not useful.

After retreating for a distance, the giant crocodiles started to give up on chasing and turned to snatch the corpses of their companions.

For a moment, the snow-white ice was dyed red. Blood and flesh were everywhere, and the sounds of giant crocodiles fighting for their companions' corpses could be heard.

The big black bear escaped the encirclement and limped over.

"Ga —"

Right at this moment, an ear-piercing cry suddenly came from the sky above.

Then, two black shadows spread their wings and rushed down.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and his heart trembled. It was two pterodactyls\!

The two pterodactyls were green and huge. They bared two rows of sharp fangs and swooped down extremely quickly, arriving in front of him in the blink of an eye\!

They also seemed to want to take a share.

However, one of the pterodactyls suddenly turned around and rushed towards Chu Xiaoye and the little girl with a murderous aura\!

The little girl riding on Chu Xiaoye immediately rolled down and crawled under his stomach. She shouted, "King\! Protect me\!"

The big black bear was originally limping over. When it saw this scene, it immediately roared and increased its speed.

However, its speed could not compare to the pterosaur that was charging over quickly\!

"Whoosh —"

The wyvern brought with it a whistling wind as it opened its sharp iron claws and grabbed at Chu Xiaoye\!

In this empty place, it was impossible to escape.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye had never thought of escaping.

"Whoosh\!"

He did not retreat but advanced. He suddenly jumped up, and a few cold lights lit up on his sharp golden claws. A stream of air suddenly sprayed out from behind him, and he avoided the wing dragon's sharp claws and grabbed at its thin neck\!

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

The wing dragon's neck and head left its body and flew out\!

"Bang\!"

The pterodactyl's head was cut off and it fell heavily to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye also landed on the ground.

However, when the little girl hiding under him jumped up and spat out the airflow, the airflow happened to spray at her. The terrifying black fog instantly enveloped her.

"Ugh —"

The black antelope meat that he had just eaten a few bites of immediately vomited.

"Ga —"

Right at this moment, another ear-piercing scream came from the sky above\!

This time, the cries were even sharper and louder.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly looked up and was shocked. It was another pterodactyl\!

This pterodactyl was fiery red, larger, and more ferocious. It dived even faster, as if it was angry at the tragic death of its companions and was diving at them\!

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. He widened his eyes and looked at the back of the pterodactyl in disbelief.

On the back of this pterodactyl was a human-like figure\!

They were getting closer and closer\!

They were not humans\!

That thing had green skin, horns on its head, a strange face, and bulging muscles. It was wearing a simple animal skin and looked like an orc\!

The fiery red pterodactyl screamed and swooped down\!

The strange creature suddenly let out an excited roar\!

Its green eyes looked round at the little girl on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to think. Just as he was about to do the same thing and jump up to kill this fiery red pterodactyl, he saw the fiery red pterodactyl suddenly open its mouth and spit out a thin flame with a bang\!

An intense heat assaulted him\!

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to dodge and flames ignited on his body.

At the same time, the fiery red-winged dragon had already swooped down and grabbed the little girl beside it with its sharp iron claws.

"Roar—"

The big black bear roared and pounced forward.

The strange creature sitting on the fiery red pterodactyl suddenly raised the spear-like weapon in its hand. With a puff, it pierced into the big black bear's bloody mouth\!

The intense pain suddenly made the big black bear lose its strength and fall heavily to the ground.

The fiery red pterodactyl's two iron claws had already appeared on the little girl's fluttering golden hair.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly rushed over from the side\!

Silver light flashed and blood splashed\!

The huge fiery red pterodactyl's stomach was cut open\!

It suddenly opened its mouth and let out an extremely miserable scream. It flapped its wings with all its might, wanting to fly into the sky again, but its body tilted and it fell down like a kite with a broken string, landing heavily on the ground not far away. It slid a long distance on the smooth ice before stopping.

The strange creature sitting on its back was caught off guard and fell to the ground.

It hurriedly took out a sharp stone saber that was like a dagger from its waist. Just as it was about to get up from the ground, Catherine had already jumped over at lightning speed. She swung her silver claw and cut open its stomach with a whoosh. Then, she flashed past and jumped to the ground not far away.

The strange creature's eyes bulged and it let out a miserable scream. It fell to the ground, covered its stomach, and rolled in pain.

Soon, he died completely.

The fiery red pterodactyl that had its stomach cut open had already stopped breathing.

Perhaps their combination would never have dreamed that they, who were famous for their ferocity and made all wild beasts tremble in fear, would actually die at the hands of a young lioness, and their stomachs would be cruelly cut open\!

They could fly, breathe fire, throw spears, use weapons and intelligence, and have a geographical advantage.

However, they failed miserably.

Catherine did not look at them much and quickly ran in front of her king.

The flames on Chu Xiaoye's body had already been extinguished.

However, the golden fur that he had painstakingly grown on his body was gone again.

This was definitely a tragedy.

"Tibbs\! Bear with it\!"

The little girl grabbed the spear-like thing and pulled it out of Tibbs' mouth with all her might.

Fortunately, this thing did not penetrate Tibbs' neck.

Tibbs crawled on the ground, vomiting blood. He trembled in pain, but he endured it and did not roar.

The little girl encouraged it to be braver.

When the remaining green pterodactyl saw the fiery red pterodactyl land, it hurriedly threw down the food in its mouth, rose into the sky, and fled.

Chu Xiaoye no longer pitied himself.

He came in front of the fiery red pterodactyl and the strange creature and sized them up with his eyes wide.

Especially the creature that looked like a human or a beast. It completely subverted his understanding of this world.

"They're called orcs. Legend has it that they're species produced by humans and ancient ferocious beasts. Actually, they were originally like humans and animals and were another species that had existed long ago."

Just as Chu Xiaoye was watching the scene in front of him in a daze, the little girl dragged the stone artifact spear over and explained softly.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned when he heard this and turned to look at her.

It seemed that this little girl knew a lot. And the things she had said previously might be true.

The pterodactyls spat fire and the orcs appeared. What was impossible?

"Does it hurt? You were hit by the dragon flames just now. I thought you were dead for sure."

The little girl looked at him in concern, then stared at his bare body and pursed her lips into a smile. "It seems that you're more resistant to heat than I thought."

This was not funny.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her solemnly. The waves in his heart could not be calmed for a long time.

"Alright, we have to leave quickly."

The little girl waved the spear in her hand and looked at Catherine, who was as quiet as a virgin and moving as lightning. She smiled and said, "Originally, there was only one spot, but now, there's an additional one. This orc is dead, so you can go in."

She paused and smiled again. "You're stronger than the king. At least, you entered by yourself."

Catherine's gaze was cold and she ignored her, as if her smile and praise did not make her happy as much as the king's gaze.

"This King is not a freeloader."

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to prove himself.

However, not to mention that there was no chance now, the majestic and beautiful lion had become a hairless turkey again.

"We should go. Otherwise, more trouble will come later."

The little girl carried the spear that was twice as tall as her on her shoulder and walked naturally to Chu Xiaoye's side. She lifted her skirt and prepared to climb up.

The big black bear was injured. Then, the task of carrying her would be handed to another strong body.

"The king has no fur and is very smooth. It should be quite nice to ride him."

That was what she thought.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not think so.

He did not stand on ceremony and slapped this greedy little girl to the ground.

The big black bear roared angrily, but it did not dare to come over.

No matter how much it transformed, it did not dare to provoke this former lion king. Furthermore, there was an even more terrifying killer standing not far from this lion king.

"If you let me ride you, I'll tell you what the orc said when he saw me just now."

The little girl got up from the ground. She was not angry or angry. Instead, she threw out the bait with a smile.

When the orc saw her just now, it cried out excitedly and ordered the fiery red pterodactyl to prepare to catch her.

Chu Xiaoye was indeed very curious.

However, this was not enough to make him put down his kingly status and suffer the humiliation of his crotch.

He rejected it firmly.

The little girl shrugged and said, "Alright, then I'll add another sincere condition. I can be merciful and let you kiss my foot."

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and swung his tail, slapping her to the ground again.

"Aiya\! Why don't I let you kiss my little face?"

The little girl said as she lay on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked in front of the fiery red pterodactyl. He extended his claws and soaked them in the bright red blood.

If he could replicate the dragon flames of this fiery red pterodactyl, it would be perfect.

The blood of this pterodactyl was actually boiling\!

Suddenly, a hot stream came from the tip of his claw, as if something was crawling into his body along the tip of his claw endlessly\!

At the same time, he suddenly felt his butt turn cold, as if something was about to enter from behind.

One hot and one cold, one behind and one behind. Could it be two skills?

Other than the high-temperature dragon flames, could it be that there was also ice dragon flames?

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye immediately perked up and was secretly excited. He stood in place and did not dare to move. He could not help but fantasize all sorts of cool scenes.

"Hehe."

The little girl's laughter suddenly came from behind.

Chu Xiaoye was concentrating on accepting the super skill. He originally ignored it, but he still subconsciously looked back.

This glance almost made him faint from anger\!

The little girl was grinning as she lay on the ground, using the spear in her hand to push his butt\!

It turned out that the coldness he felt on his butt was the cold tip of the spear\!
