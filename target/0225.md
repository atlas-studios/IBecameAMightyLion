Chapter 225: The Ferocious White Tiger

"Hey…"

The colorful tiger lay on the ground with its mouth open and let out a desperate and unbelievable whimper. Its body twitched a few times and it died completely.

The white female tiger was still looking up at the young figure on the tree.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her solemnly.

This white female tiger looked even stronger and smarter. It was definitely not something that the colorful tiger could compare to.

From her cold attitude towards the colorful tiger, it was clear that their relationship was not intimate. The colorful tiger was like the grassland lions, and had no status here.

The white female tiger looked up at him for a while under the tree but did not climb up the tree. Instead, she lowered her head and looked at the cave not far away.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. Could she have already discovered them?

If she had really discovered the lion brothers, he could only watch helplessly from the tree and would not go down to save them.

Because in the snow-covered forest, he was not sure if he was a match for this white female tiger.

He could not put his life in danger for the sake of two strangers.

Fortunately.

The white female tiger only took a glance and did not go over.

She turned around and walked into the depths of the forest, as if she had given up on this hunt.

Under the tree, the colorful tiger's corpse stayed in place.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and watched her huge figure leave. He felt that the gaze of this white female tiger just now was too terrifying and that she did not really leave.

Although he saw the other party disappear into the distant forest, he was not in a hurry to go down.

He turned around and saw that the white lion sisters were still hanging their heads and limbs. They were lying on a branch, trembling.

However, they all opened their eyes with tears in them. No one knew if they were frightened or if they thought they had peed and were embarrassed.

Chu Xiaoye decided to try using them to see if the white female tiger had really left.

He bit the white lion sister's neck, brought her down, and threw her under the tree.

The moment Alice landed, she immediately jumped up. She first looked at the tiger corpse on the ground in fear, then took a few steps back hurriedly. She raised her head and looked at him in fear.

She had just seen on the tree that this kid had cut off the foot of this tiger with a single claw. He was even more ferocious than her brother\!

She did not dare to roar anymore, afraid that she would attract the white female tiger again.

She raised her head and looked pleadingly at the fellow on the tree.

This was a bumpkin from the grassland at a glance, but his strength was even more perverted than theirs. He must have grown up eating feces\!

Seeing that there was no movement in the forest, Chu Xiaoye picked up another female cub, climbed to the root, and threw her down.

After Wei Li landed on the snow, she still lay there motionless.

Alice hurriedly walked to her side, lowered her head, and rubbed her head to make her get up faster.

Only then did Wei Li open her eyes and slowly get up from the ground. However, she did not dare to raise her head or look at the tree. She immediately lowered her head and left quickly.

Alice was stunned for a moment. She looked up at Chu Xiaoye on the tree, cracked her mouth, and bared her teeth, as if she was saying, "Kid, just you wait\! Although you saved us sisters, you also scared us until we peed our pants\! If we don't take revenge, we won't be lions\! Just you wait\!"

Then, she left quickly.

After the sisters left, two heads popped out of the cave not far away.

The two male brothers were terrified just now and thought that they would lose their lives.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and was about to walk over to take a look at the situation when a strong wind suddenly came from behind. With a whoosh, it pressed over\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He did not have the time to look back and hurriedly fell to the ground, rolling towards the right\!

"Bang\!"

A huge figure fell where he had just stood and snow splashed all over the ground.

Chu Xiaoye got up and looked. It was actually the white female tiger that had returned\!

Indeed, she did not give up\!

When they were on the tree, he already knew how big she was. Now that he was standing under the tree and facing her, he felt even more pressure from her size and aura.

The white female tiger looked down at him, clearly surprised by his reaction speed.

"Whoosh—"

She pounced again.

Chu Xiaoye decided to test her strength.

This time, he did not dodge. He jumped up and swung his claws to meet the attack\!

"Bang\!"

The two feet, one big and one small, collided heavily\!

They tacitly did not show their claws.

Chu Xiaoye felt his body tremble and a huge force suddenly came from his feet.

He could not help but fly out diagonally and fall heavily into the snow.

He originally thought that his current strength had already evolved to a very abnormal level. He did not expect that the strength of this white female tiger was even more abnormal and was completely crushing him\!

He jumped up from the snow, his entire thigh feeling numb. When the heat in his body surged past, the numbness quickly disappeared.

"Whoosh\!"

He narrowed his eyes and flicked his golden claw.

Since she wanted to fight, he would fight\!

Who was afraid of who\!

The white female tiger looked at him calmly and slowly raised her right palm. With a whoosh, she also flicked her claws.

Damn\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at her claws in shock and could not help but curse in his heart\!

Not only were the claws of this female tiger sharp like blades, but they were also pervertedly long. They were even longer than his calves and were more than ten centimeters long\!

They were like a few sharp curved blades that were stuck on the webbing of his feet and were shining\!

"Damn it\!"

Chu Xiaoye cursed and no longer hesitated. He turned around and ran. With a whoosh, he jumped onto a big tree at the side and quickly climbed to a high place.

No matter how sharp his claws were, he could not fight against this hanging force.

As long as he was hit by the other party's claw, his skin and flesh would definitely be lacerated and his body would be separated miserably.

He did not have any hatred for the other party, so there was no need to risk his life.

The mutation of this female tiger was extraordinary. Ordinary lions were no match for her at all. Unless it was the larger and more ferocious lion king, perhaps he could send her flying with a slap.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and waved his claws at her, telling her to scram, indicating that he was not interested in fighting her.

However, to his surprise, the white tiger actually walked under the tree and raised its claws. With a crack, it pierced into the tree trunk and tore off a large piece of bark and wood.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. Wasn't this the tree cutting he had previously practised?

This female tiger was immoral\!

Not only did she secretly learn his skills, but she also destroyed the environment and cut indiscriminately\!

Where was Xiong Da and Xiong Er? There is a tigress cutting trees\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar suddenly came from below the hill not far away\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up. It was not Xiong Da and Xiong Er, but the lioness, Letty, who had returned from hunting.

Letty ran up the hill, bared her fangs, and roared at the white female tiger, but she stopped there and did not dare to come over again. Clearly, she knew very well that she was no match for this female tiger.

The white female tiger turned around and looked at her. Then, she suddenly turned around and walked towards the cave over there.

Letty was shocked. She hurriedly roared angrily and ran over.

At this moment, the white female tiger suddenly stopped in her tracks and looked at her coldly.

It turned out that she had long discovered that this lioness had hidden the two sick male lion brothers in her territory, but she did not come and kill them.

Now, she was warning this lioness not to be nosy. Otherwise, she and her two children would be unlucky\!

Letty ran in front of the cave and stopped there. She looked at her in fear, then looked up at Chu Xiaoye on the tree.

She was conflicted.

She did not dare to offend this powerful female tiger, but she did not want this young lion to be killed.

After all, her sons might still need him.

The white female tiger looked at her threateningly and ignored her. She returned to under the big tree and raised her claws. With a whoosh, she grabbed another large chunk of tree trunk.

The entire tree started to sway.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at her and secretly guessed her true intentions.

If she wanted to take revenge for the colorful tiger, she would never have shown mercy with her claw just now. It was possible that before his claw could touch hers, it would be cut off by her long and sharp claws.

Therefore, she probably did not want to take his life.

However, why was she pestering him so relentlessly?

Could it be that she saw how handsome he was and…

No, to different species, the word "handsome" did not exist at all. Be it lions looking at tigers or tigers looking at lions, they would definitely think that the other party was ugly.

"Chi\!"

The white female tiger swiped again and emptied more than half of the tree trunk.

The entire tree swayed.

Letty looked up at him, her eyes filled with anxiety and worry.

Chu Xiaoye was fearless. Just as he was about to jump onto another tree, the white female tiger under the tree suddenly stopped and looked up at him, letting out a low growl.

This further confirmed Chu Xiaoye's guess.

This fierce female tiger did not want his life.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the tree and lowered his head to look at her. He let out a roar and asked her what she was doing?

The white female tiger suddenly turned around and aimed her butt at the tree. She raised her tail and twisted her body, like a female dog in heat.

"..."

Chu Xiaoye was dumbfounded.

In front of the cave, Letty was also frozen in place.

Was this female tiger… looking for a mate?

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a few seconds before he was shocked and furious. He roared angrily and cursed, "Shameless\! Dream on\! This King would rather die than submit\!"

The white female tiger turned around and looked up at him. She actually shook her head like a human to show that that was not what she meant.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned. What did that mean?

"Roar —"

Seeing that she could not communicate with him clearly, the white female tiger immediately roared at the distant forest.

Not long after, a little female tiger with snow-white fur walked out of the forest carefully. Her round head and eyes looked charmingly naive. Her size was about the same as Chu Xiaoye's and she was clearly not even a year old.

When she saw her mother, she hurriedly ran over, but she fell to the ground with a bang. She ate a mouthful of snow and rolled down the mountain. She looked stupid and comical.

Chu Xiaoye's face twitched when he saw this. Was he going to be a nanny or a bodyguard?

The white female tiger ignored her rolling daughter and raised her head, continuing to look at him with a burning gaze.

For some reason, Chu Xiaoye felt a little terrified as he looked at her.
