Chapter 474: The Dispirited Lion King

Half a month later.

Chu Xiaoye started to feel despair.

At first, Chu Xiaoye felt that the fur and golden mane that had been removed from his body would definitely grow back in time.

She was even more beautiful than before.

He looked forward to it, thinking about it day and night.

However, half a month later, his bare and ugly body was still bare and barren. He was still like a newborn baby, pink and naked.

Did he hurt his roots and would his fur never grow out?

Chu Xiaoye regretted it.

Although the leopard skin on him was very fitting and warm, this was not his clothes.

Without a mane, could a lion still be considered a lion?

The lion king was wearing a fur coat and looked sloppy. Without his dignity, was he still a lion king?

Every time the sun rose and set, Chu Xiaoye was sad, sad about his bald head that had yet to reach middle age.

"King, don't be sad. Annie won't look down on you."

Every time this happened, the little girl would stand beside him and stroke his bald head gently with her little hand. Her eyes were gentle, as if she was stroking a pitiful puppy. She would look into the distance with him with a thoughtful expression.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that he was the only one thinking.

He hated being touched and hated being comforted by a little thing that did not even have a home with a beast.

Although he had always appeared very calm and strong outside, the members of the pride still keenly sensed his loneliness and sadness.

Everyone was worried and sympathized with him.

Even Qiqi and Nunu rarely played in front of him anymore, afraid that their happiness would anger him.

Recently, the cold father had been very pleased with himself and always flaunted the lush and black mane on his neck. Every time Chu Xiaoye appeared, he would deliberately tremble a few times and deliberately show his frustration that his mane was becoming more and more majestic.

"I hate such lush, beautiful, and charming manes."

He seemed to be conveying this meaning.

Over this period of time, he finally broke free from the adversity of being attacked by his unfilial son. Furthermore, he turned the tables and won beautifully.

This made him happy.

"I finally won a round\!"

The cold father beamed every day.

Until one night, when the moon was dark and the wind was high and the north wind was roaring, when he went out to pee, he was ambushed by a black shadow and fainted with a slap.

When he woke up in a daze, the dense black mane on his neck had already been plucked clean.

He had become a bald lion…

"Unfilial son\! May you get struck by lightning\!"

Although he did not see the attacker clearly, he was sure that it was that unfilial son who was jealous of the viciousness under his lush and beautiful mane\!

Time passed quickly.

In the blink of an eye, a month passed.

The new territory did not welcome many competitors and there were pitifully few invaders. The few sporadic ones were beaten to the ground by Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others and fled.

This pride that had migrated thousands of kilometers finally stabilized here.

Little Curly Tail had become larger and more mature. He already had the demeanor of a leader.

During the period that Chu Xiaoye was in seclusion and resting, he brought the pride to hunt and patrol and defeat enemies. He did well and became more and more proficient.

His growth was obvious.

Everyone could see how dispirited Chu Xiaoye was.

To Chu Xiaoye's despair, after a month, the fur on his body still did not show any signs of growing.

The food had already become bland and tasteless. The female lions had also lost their attractiveness. Even the sun above him made him panic. He felt that he was completely useless.

Without fur, he was like a turkey with all its fur plucked. He had no dignity and could only be a joke.

He removed his calm and unconcerned disguise and was unwilling to go out again. He hid in the tree hole. Other than the little girl, no one was allowed to enter. He was feeling dejected in the darkness and loneliness.

Everyone's pity could only be expressed in their food and in their eyes that he could not see or was unwilling to see.

However, no matter how delicious the food was, it was not attractive to him now. He could not even be bothered to eat or waste any more energy. He only wanted to lie there motionless.

He was dispirited and especially sleepy. Even if he had not eaten for a few days, he would not feel hungry.

He felt that he might be dying soon.

How could animals that lived in the wild survive without the protection of fur?

Be it day or night, the little girl was always by his side. Sometimes, she would silently hug his neck and not speak. Sometimes, she would sit in front of him and talk endlessly. Sometimes, she would even be bold enough to play with his tail and whiskers. These few days, she had been even more overboard. She started to rub her feet on him and even placed them on his head to threaten him.

"Hmph, if you don't get up, Annie will stick her toes into your mouth\!"

The little girl always encouraged him to pull himself together again. Even without his mane and lion fur, even with his patterned leopard skin, he could still become a strong and domineering lion king.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he should pull himself together and that this setback was nothing. However, lying down during this period of time seemed to have a problem.

He was really exhausted and could not lift his spirit. He felt uncomfortable even if he moved, let alone have an appetite.

He thought that he might be sick.

Disease was definitely a very terrifying thing for animals. Most animals would slowly die when they fell ill.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye felt that he might be dying.

He never would have thought that not only did those poisonous bees abduct his fur, they might also abduct his life.

"Alright\! You're not getting up yet, right?"

Seeing that he was still lying on the ground motionless, the little girl was a little angry. She actually really extended a small foot in front of his mouth and stuck it there. She said angrily, "I'll give you one last chance\! If you don't get up, I'll really stick my toes into your mouth\!"

Sticking one's toes into the lion king's mouth was definitely a terrifying insult, especially to this prideful lion king.

Chu Xiaoye was furious, but he did not have the strength to get up. Furthermore, to his shame and despair, he actually felt… extremely excited about the smell of this little girl's toes, or rather, the smell coming from her toes\!

He actually drooled pervertedly\!

At this moment, he woke up. Not only today, during this period of time, he was also excited by the strange fragrance emitted by this little girl. He even had to breathe greedily in his sleep. Even if he did not eat, he wanted to breathe.

He did not allow any members of the pride to enter, even the loyal Catherine. However, he could not resist this human girl at all.

He had actually fallen for her scent at some point in time\!
