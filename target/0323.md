Chapter 323: Open the Belly

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and was the first to rush up. His golden claws were like a meteor that cut through the sky as they shot towards the black lion king\!

At the same time, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Tilly, and Catherine also pounced forward.

"Roar—"

Balo roared angrily. He was still extremely ferocious despite fighting five alone\!

The sharp claws scratched his body, causing a series of sparks, as if blades were colliding and letting out an ear-piercing sound of collision and friction.

Catherine's silver claw pierced into the place where he had just been injured again. If he had not turned around to counterattack, his stomach would have been immediately cut open\!

"Bang\!"

Catherine, who had succeeded in one hit, was sent flying by this black lion king's slap. After falling to the ground, she could not get up for a long time.

Mei Mei, who had pounced behind the black lion king and was about to bite it, was also sent flying by his tail.

"Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail's tail suddenly flew out and quickly wrapped around the black lion king's hind leg. He pulled hard and pulled him to the ground.

Tilly's claws came down and grabbed his head. Although they did not pierce his skull, she grabbed a large amount of flesh with a whoosh\!

"Roar—"

Balo roared angrily and suddenly jumped up. He raised his hind legs and dragged Little Curly Tail to his side.

Just as he opened his bloody mouth and was about to bite down, Chu Xiaoye's claws broke through the air with a whoosh and smashed heavily on his head\!

"Bang\!"

Balo's strong body, which was nearly 500 kilograms, was sent flying and he fell more than ten meters away in a sorry state.

Then, he lay on the ground motionless.

Tilly's figure flashed and shot over. She took this opportunity to raise her golden claw and scratch the bloody wound on his abdomen, preparing to kill him with one move\!

Right at this moment, this lion king that was lying motionless on the ground like it had fainted suddenly jumped up and bit her neck with a roar. Then, it turned around and ran.

Tilly's life gate was restrained and all her strength instantly disappeared. She was limp in his mouth and could not resist.

Her eyes looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was chasing after her. Her eyes were watery and she looked like she was about to cry.

"Pfft—"

Chu Xiaoye sprayed air and suddenly jumped up, landing in front of this black lion king and blocking his path.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and Mei Mei also caught up and surrounded him again.

Balo stopped and looked coldly at the young lion king in front of him. Then, he raised his head and shook the little white lion in his mouth with a teasing expression.

Little Curly Tail roared and wagged his tail, preparing to pounce on it.

He did not care about this little white lion\!

Furthermore, after this period of observation, his brother did not care about this little white lion\!

Therefore, so what if he died\!

However, his brother did not move. He could only tolerate it.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the roar of a lion suddenly came from the distant forest.

Then, the lion's roar sounded one after another\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart sank. He finally knew where the uneasiness in his heart came from.

It turned out that this black lion king had helpers\!

Hearing the roars of these lions, Balo could not help but open his mouth and show a cunning expression as if his plan had succeeded. Unexpectedly, his teeth loosened a little. Tilly, who he had bitten on the neck, suddenly raised her claws and grabbed his eyes with a whoosh\!

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

Tilly's claws suddenly pierced into his right eye and dug out his eyeball\!

"Roar—"

A miserable scream suddenly sounded in the entire oasis\!

The sudden intense pain made Balo let go of his mouth and suddenly jump up from the ground. He swung his head in pain and roared hysterically\!

Tilly landed on the ground and immediately got up, escaping to Chu Xiaoye's side. With a whoosh, she crawled under him and shrank her neck, whimpering, looking pitiful as she sought protection.

Catherine immediately jumped up and pounced at the injured Balo, but she was slapped away with a bang.

At this moment, this black lion king seemed to have gone crazy. In its anger, it attacked randomly and used all its strength to hit the surrounding bushes, causing them to fly everywhere.

"Roar—"

The roars of the lions were getting closer and closer.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw a group of huge lions baring their fangs and running over with a murderous aura. There were at least thirty to forty of them.

The birds and rabbits in the bushes fled in panic.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he could not hesitate at this moment\!

"Pfft—"

He suddenly shot at the black lion king and used his head to hit the other party heavily\!

The black lion king that was crazily attacking could not react in time and was sent flying by him\!

Just as he landed on the ground, Chu Xiaoye's golden claw pierced into the wound on his abdomen with a whoosh. He pulled hard and cut open his stomach\!

"Roar—"

Balo suddenly let out a miserable scream. His face was covered in blood and he could not see him at all. He could only open his mouth and bite him ferociously\!

Seeing that the lions were about to rush close, Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate anymore. He immediately growled and ran with Little Curly Tail and the others, charging into the forest on the other side.

Balo lay on the ground with his abdomen cut open and blood sprayed out. He let out an angry and painful roar. His face was badly mutilated and one of his eyes was missing. He looked ferocious and terrifying\!

When the lions rushed in front of him, they did not recognize him for a moment.

However, when they heard his miserable roar, they finally woke up. The extremely miserable lion in front of them was actually their former king\!

"Roar—"

They roared angrily and continued to chase after Chu Xiaoye and the others.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that Catherine was staggering and about to fall to the ground. He hurriedly went over and picked her up in his mouth, continuing to run.

The little lioness had just been seriously injured a few times and was clearly seriously injured. Furthermore, she was seriously exhausted and had to rest as soon as possible. Otherwise, the injuries in her body could not be reversed.

Little Curly Tail and the others were already exhausted. Their running speed became slower and slower.

Chu Xiaoye knew that as long as he was caught up by that pride, they would be completely wiped out.

Now, the few of them had exhausted a lot of their strength and no longer had the strength to fight.

Fortunately, the forest ahead became more and more advanced.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he ran into the forest, Chu Xiaoye jumped up with Catherine in his mouth.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Tilly also jumped onto the tree and climbed to the highest point.

The trees here were sparse and not too tall. However, to many lions, it was still not easy to climb.

The thinner the tree, the less they dared to climb.

This group of lions were tall and strong lions that weighed more than 400 kilograms. Their claws and the trees here were not enough to support their heavy bodies.

Therefore, after climbing up the tree, Chu Xiaoye finally heaved a sigh of relief.

However, what should he do next?

Food and water were what they needed very much now.

Without the replenishment of this energy, it was difficult for them to recover their strength and wounds quickly. They could only be trapped on the tree, becoming more and more hungry and thirsty, becoming weaker and weaker, and waiting for death slowly.

At this moment, the miserable roar of the black lion king finally stopped.
