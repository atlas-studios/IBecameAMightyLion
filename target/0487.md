Chapter 487: The Little Girl's Giant Sword

Chu Xiaoye was lost.

After crossing the bridge and entering this ancient snow forest, he was lost.

The sun could not be seen in the sky and he could not find his direction.

No one knew which path he took when he came, and the traces on the road disappeared without a trace.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine forward and repeated the same path, but he could not escape this forest.

As for the light screen he saw previously, it was nowhere to be seen.

He jumped onto the tree and looked up. His vision was still filled with the boundless snow forest and he could not see the end.

Soon, the sky turned dark.

Night quietly enveloped them.

The entire snow forest fell into darkness.

There was no sound around, not even the sound of birds.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to find a place to rest for the night, a suppressed cry suddenly came from the forest in front of him.

The cry was very soft, but it was exceptionally clear in the quiet forest.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and immediately rushed over with Catherine.

The cries were getting closer and closer.

Under a big tree not far ahead, a figure was sitting with his head lowered and crying, as if he had encountered something sad.

It was a human girl wearing rough animal skin. Her hair was loose and her body looked very thin.

When Chu Xiaoye and Catherine walked in front of her, she looked up and her red eyes suddenly widened. Then, her body trembled and she retreated. She leaned against the tree tightly, as if she wanted to shrink into the thick tree trunk.

She trembled, her black eyes filled with fear.

A bare lion and a female lion appeared in front of her. At this moment, any lone human would be afraid, let alone a delicate woman.

The girl hurriedly pulled out a dagger made of stone from her waist. Her hands were trembling as she held it. Her legs were already limp and she could not stand up.

"Please… Don't eat me…"

She held the dagger and begged with tears in her eyes.

Her language was very strange, like that elf's language, but it was not. Anyway, he could understand it.

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and wrote a word on the snow. "Path?"

He wanted to ask for directions.

The girl widened her eyes and looked at the words on the ground, then raised her head to look at him. She repeated it a few times before saying with a trembling voice, "You… you know how to write?"

Before Chu Xiaoye could ask again, she immediately got up from the ground, took a few steps closer, and wiped her tears. She said excitedly, "You know how to write, right? I'm lost. Can you tell me the way out? Please, I should go home. If I don't go home, my father and mother will be worried about me. As long as you help me go home, I'll definitely repay you, okay?"

Before Chu Xiaoye could answer, she suddenly threw down the dagger in her hand and loosened the belt at her waist. She took off her clothes and revealed her smooth body.

"Help me. As long as you help me, I'll give you this girl's body, okay?"

The girl took a few steps forward again and almost stuck to Chu Xiaoye's face.

She extended her jade-like hands and wanted to stroke Chu Xiaoye's face. Her charming eyes were filled with begging and anticipation.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

The girl had just reached in front of Chu Xiaoye when he suddenly raised his claws and mercilessly cut them off from her arm\!

"You…"

The girl widened her eyes and looked at him in shock, still stretching her broken arm.

The strange thing was that she did not scream, as if it was not painful.

"My hand… I just peeled it off yesterday…"

The girl trembled in sadness and looked at him in disbelief. "I was kind enough to give you my body. It's fine if you don't want it, but why did you cut off my arm? Why are you so cruel?"

With that said, a pair of sharp claws suddenly grew out of her broken arm. She grabbed the corner of her mouth and slowly tore it open as if she was peeling skin\!

Until her entire face and head of hair were torn off, her true appearance was revealed—an old woman with a face full of wrinkles, deep eye sockets, and a sharp horn on her head\!

She opened her mouth and let out a sharp laugh that was even more unpleasant than crying. She raised her claws again and grabbed her neck, tearing off the human skin on her entire body.

"What a beautiful girl. Her skin is tight and tender. She was just 14 yesterday. When I killed her family and peeled off her skin, she was still lying on the ground crying bloodily. She should be crying for her lost youth."

The old woman with a split mouth revealed her sharp and black teeth. She spread the human skin in her hand with a regretful expression.

Then, she looked at Chu Xiaoye. "Don't you want such a beautiful body?"

Before Chu Xiaoye could answer, her old face suddenly revealed an enlightened expression. "Oh, I almost forgot. You're a lion. Why would you like a human body? You like female lions, right?"

She looked at Catherine with her muddy and dark eyes and grinned. "I should have peeled off the skin of this lioness and worn it to lure you, right?"

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine pounced forward and swung her sharp silver claws\!

The old woman suddenly jumped back and was as agile as a hind. Then, she threw away the human skin in her hand and climbed up the tree behind her with a whoosh. She chuckled and suddenly said loudly, "What are you waiting for? Although it's a bald lion, it doesn't look weak\! Capture it and give it to all the lords to enjoy. Perhaps, they might even mate out a few more powerful little fellows\!"

Just as he finished speaking, seven to eight figures suddenly jumped out from the ground around him. They were all holding stone spears and had horns on their heads. They were ferocious and had tall and sturdy bodies. They were rather similar to the orc riding the fiery red pterodactyl from before\!

These orcs were extremely agile and were best at teamwork. They immediately surrounded Chu Xiaoye and Catherine in the middle, letting out threatening cries and brandishing their spears, looking rather excited.

Chu Xiaoye was not afraid of these monsters with spears. As long as he was fast enough, these monsters could not do anything to him.

The main reason was that the old woman who had jumped onto the tree made his back turn cold and gave him a lot of pressure and threat.

At this moment, the old woman had taken out a bow from somewhere and was pulling the bowstring full, aiming at him coldly.

To be able to use human skin to change her appearance, if he did not see this ability with his own eyes, he would not believe it.

Obviously, this old woman with a ferocious appearance like a witch was not an ordinary orc. Other than the bow in her hand, she probably had other skills.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Catherine beside him and decided to end the battle quickly. As long as he realized that the situation was wrong, he would escape immediately.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly jumped up and pounced at the old orc woman hiding on the tree.

"Whoosh —"

The bowstring vibrated and the arrow shot out\!

At the same time, a stream of air suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye and changed his direction, causing him to dodge the arrow that was flying over.

He landed below the old woman and tapped the tree trunk with the tip of his foot. With a whoosh, he jumped up again and pounced at the old woman above.

"Whoosh\!"

A dazzling light suddenly lit up from the old woman's hand with a hot aura\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt a pain in his eyes and his vision turned white. He could not see anything.

He swung his sharp claws and grabbed at the place where the old woman was hiding, but he missed.

The old woman had already jumped away and pulled the bowstring full again. With a whoosh, she shot out a second arrow\!

This arrow pierced through Chu Xiaoye's left front leg and almost pierced into his stomach\!

Under the tree, the orcs were brandishing the spears in their hands and attacking Catherine.

Catherine could barely take care of herself.

The pain woke Chu Xiaoye up.

His eyes were burning and blank.

He did not hesitate and immediately jumped down from the tree and landed on the ground. He let out a roar and called for Catherine to escape quickly.

The dazzling light emitted by the thing in the old woman's hand only blinded his eyes for the time being and did not cause any substantial damage. However, the other party's methods were probably more than this.

They had to escape quickly.

Just as he opened his mouth and was about to let out a lion king roar to give Catherine the opportunity to escape the encirclement, the ground suddenly collapsed with a bang.

He was caught off guard and fell into the trap that had long been set up underground.

However, the other party had clearly underestimated his strength.

The pit was very deep, but there were no fatal weapons set up.

Chu Xiaoye had just fallen into the pit when he used the surrounding walls as a springboard. With a few rises and falls, he jumped up again.

The old orc woman, who had just rushed over, let out a cry of surprise. She was clearly a little surprised. She immediately took out an arrow and strung it, aiming at him.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye's eyes had already recovered a little.

He faced the old orc woman and stood there, not escaping.

He decided to counterattack\!

The orc old woman pulled the bowstring full and looked at his open eyes in bewilderment. Her wrinkled old face was filled with shock.

His recovery speed was beyond her expectations again.

The light of her treasure was even stronger than the sun. As long as she looked at it, she would be blind for half a day. After half a day, even if her vision was restored, there would be obvious burn marks on her eyeballs and her vision would be filled with black dots.

She had dealt with many beasts and humans before and they were all very effective.

But now, the bald lion in front of her had actually started to recover in such a short time. Furthermore, there did not seem to be any wounds on its eyeballs. How could she not be shocked?

She was becoming more and more interested in this bald lion.

If they could mate with him, the descendants they gave birth to would definitely exceed the expectations of all their clansmen\!

At the thought of this, she started to be excited and pulled the bow in her hand to its fullest.

"Whoosh —"

A cold wind suddenly blew from behind.

At the same time, a series of rapid footsteps suddenly came\!

The old woman's expression changed. Just as she turned around to look, a wide iron sword suddenly fell from the sky with a whoosh and cut open her head. It followed her head and cut straight down, splitting her entire body into two\!

Vilis landed lightly on the ground and did not look at her. She picked up her huge sword and rushed towards the orcs that were attacking Catherine.

She jumped very high and far. Her speed was very fast, as if she had teleported. In the blink of an eye, she had already jumped behind the orcs. Her two slender short legs bounced on the ground and she swung the huge sword in her hand heavily, as if she was running with the huge sword.

It looked rather comical as it staggered around.

However, in the blink of an eye, the tall and strong and agile orc had their heads cut off and blood sprayed\!
