Chapter 348: Untitled

The little girl crossed the river safely.

When it came to the remaining lions, it was much faster.

Other than the cold father and the Chino brothers, who were a little afraid of water and walked slowly, Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur few jumped directly and landed on the other side.

Chu Xiaoye was the last to go over.

After all the members went ashore, he used his claws to slap away all the trees in the river and went down with the water. Then, he flew over and jumped over.

The temporary bridge was only for crossing the river.

Since they had finished crossing the river, they naturally had to tear it down.

If he kept this bridge forever, it would disrupt the current lives of the animals that lived in the forest on both sides of the river all year round, causing them to turn from looking at each other from across the river to fighting each other in the future.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and moved through the forest.

The strong aura frightened the little animals in the forest and they fled in panic.

Even some ferocious beasts could only shrink in dark caves and tremble, waiting for them to go far.

The mountain path was rugged and the higher they went, the steeper it became.

The little girl followed behind Chu Xiaoye and had already fallen a few times. Every time, she would get up and continue to follow. She did not fall behind.

Qiqi and Nunu also walked with great difficulty.

The cold father was panting and exhausted from walking. He wanted to rest, but seeing that no one had spoken, he did not want to be outdone. He could only bite the bullet and continue forward.

To all the members of the pride of the cold father, other than Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, none of them knew what was happening on the other side of the mountain.

No one dared to object to Chu Xiaoye's decision to migrate, but it did not mean that they agreed in their hearts.

Especially after such a long journey and crossing mountains, he could not see the end.

In the evening, a misty rain suddenly fell from the sky.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. The sky was covered in dark clouds and the sun had long disappeared.

"Bam\!"

The cold father lost his balance and fell heavily to the ground.

At this moment, they had already reached the middle of the mountain. It was extremely steep and the ground was mostly filled with gravel and withered wood. If they were not careful, their feet would slip and they would not be able to stand steadily.

This rain would also make their future journey even more difficult.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and could only stop in his tracks. He instructed everyone to rest in place and continue to climb after recovering their strength.

For this group of lions that lived on the grassland all year round, climbing this steep and dangerous mountain was definitely a torture.

The cold father lay on the ground like a pool of mud, panting. He could not care less about his image as a lion king. His messy and lush mane was covered in leaves and mud.

When the sky turned dark, the rain became heavier and poured down, causing the leaves to crackle.

The ground was even more humid and difficult to walk on.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and hid under the dense leaves, but he still could not avoid the rain that seeped through every hole.

The little girl hugged her legs, lowered her head, and cowered under the tree.

The rain drenched her beautiful hair and her dress, bringing with it a chill that seeped into her bones.

He was covered in sweat from climbing the mountain just now, but now, he was drenched by the rain. Even an adult could not withstand it, let alone such a weak little girl.

If nothing went wrong, she would definitely be seriously ill.

Under such circumstances, this illness might take her life.

The little girl trembled as she took out the bag of beef from her pocket. After opening it, she took out a piece and placed it in her mouth, wanting to use the food to replenish her heat.

The thin beef slice had just entered her mouth when she was stunned. She lowered her head and widened her eyes, looking at the remaining beef slices in her hand in disbelief.

Every piece of beef was wrapped in a thick layer of honey and emitted a tempting fragrance.

Eating it in her mouth gave a happy taste of returning to the past.

She carefully chewed the beef in her mouth, her eyes curved, and a happy smile appeared on her face. She looked up and saw that there was no rain above her.

In the sky, the rain was still falling, and it was getting heavier.

The young lion king was using broken branches and leaves to build a roof on the branch above her head to block the dripping rain.

The little girl raised her childish face and looked at him in a daze with her clear and innocent eyes.

"Boom\!"

Right at this moment, thunder suddenly sounded from the sky wound.

The little girl trembled in fear and hurriedly curled up into a ball, leaning tightly against the tree behind her.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning cut through the dark clouds and landed.

"Crack\!"

A big tree not far away was suddenly struck by lightning and ignited with flames. It broke in the middle and fell to the ground.

A burnt smell spread in the forest.

Chu Xiaoye, who was building a shelter on the tree, was shocked when he saw this scene. He hurriedly growled and called for Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Tilly, and Molly to come down quickly.

The sky was still filled with lightning and thunder.

He almost forgot the danger on the tree.

This weather was extremely dangerous in the forest, and staying on such a tall tree was equivalent to courting death.

Fortunately, the bolt of lightning hit the big tree not far away.

Chu Xiaoye quickly climbed down the tree and squatted beside the little girl. As he dodged the rain, he urged Little Curly Tail and the others to stop dawdling and come down quickly.

Seeing his expression and the terrifying light coming from the big tree not far away, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the others hurriedly climbed down.

All the members stayed under the tree and looked at the burning tree not far away in shock.

It seemed to be their first time seeing flames.

Little Curly Tail widened his eyes and found this scene unbelievable. The flames that jumped in the rain were like some ferocious beast baring its fangs and brandishing its claws in his eyes. They were extremely terrifying.

The rain did not extinguish the flames.

The flames became stronger and crackled, but they did not spread to the other trees.

The broken half of the tree trunk fell to the ground and burned tenaciously in the mud and grass, as if it was preparing to burn the tree completely.

The little animals hiding near the tree seemed to have instinctively sensed danger. They jumped out of the bushes and fled.

The cold father's dignified eyes reflected the jumping flames, as if he was a devil dancing. His body could not help but tremble.

All animals instinctively felt fear towards this terrifying thing that fell from the sky.

Right at this moment, the little girl, who was shivering coldly under the tree, suddenly stood up. She braved the rain and walked towards the burning tree.

She also seemed to understand that her soaked clothes and cold rain might cause her fatal harm.

And this flame that fell from the sky might be her hope to continue living.

Her face was red from the light and she walked over quickly.

The members of the pride of the cold father widened their eyes and looked at her in shock.

In their hearts, this golden-haired little animal that walked upright had always been so weak and useless. It could not even defeat Little Mi and was pitifully weak.

Now, why was she walking towards that terrifying light?

Chu Xiaoye got up and followed behind the little girl.

Catherine was still like his shadow as she followed behind him silently. No matter how terrifying the thing in front of her was, no matter if the ferocious monster would swallow her.

The little girl came in front of the burning tree and picked up many damp withered branches from the ground beside her. She slowly placed them on the flames of the half of the tree on the ground.

Smoke curled and crackled.

The wet branches quickly evaporated the water on them under the barbecue of the flames. Soon, they were dry and burned.

The little girl picked up more withered branches and built a bonfire.

The flames grew stronger and the little girl leaned close to the fire. Her face was red and her eyes were brighter.

She roasted her wet hair and soaked clothes.

However, the rain was still falling.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree, broke a few lush branches, and placed them on her head to build another shelter.

The little girl looked up at him with sparkling eyes and said softly, "Thank you."

When Little Curly Tail saw this scene, he felt that there was no danger. He hurriedly ran over and went in front of the fire, but he suddenly felt a burning sensation.

He took a few steps back in fear. He hesitated for a moment, then curiously leaned forward and stood behind the little girl, looking at the flames with shining eyes.

The little girl extended her little hand and roasted it on the flames.

Little Curly Tail felt that since this weakling dared to approach the dancing monsters, he naturally could not be too terrified.

He twisted his butt and stuck out his tail.

"Zi—"

A burning smell suddenly filled the air.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail immediately jumped three meters high and let out a terrified and miserable scream. He jumped onto a big tree at the side and swung his tail crazily behind him. He grimaced in pain and his face was distorted.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw that the fur on the tip of his tail was already burnt bald. He could not help but grin and laugh.

After laughing out loud, he was shocked. Why was his laughter like that of a human and that little white lion? Could lions laugh too?

"Chi chi chi chi…"

At this moment, another laughter came from behind.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that it was Tilly.

Tilly was laughing at Little Curly Tail and him too. Her curved eyes looked rather ferocious and he could not bear to look at her.

"Hehehehe…"

At this moment, the little girl's laughter suddenly sounded.

This extraordinary laughter shocked Tilly, Little Curly Tail, and Catherine. They looked at her as if she was a monster.

They were probably thinking that the cry this little thing made was so terrifying.

The little girl immediately covered her mouth and stopped laughing. However, she looked at them with curved eyes. Her face was red and she was full of smiles.

At this moment, she seemed to have forgotten that terrifying experience and the worry of not knowing if she could survive in the future.

The rain continued endlessly and the flames sizzled.

The little girl took out beef slices from her pocket and roasted them in the fire. She handed them to Chu Xiaoye and looked at him with sparkling eyes. She said softly, "Eat."

Of course, Chu Xiaoye would not eat such little things.

He had a majestic bloody mouth and his mouth was full of sharp and handsome fangs. He was born to eat fresh meat in big mouthfuls. Why would he eat these little snacks that were smeared with honey and sweetness?

"Just eat one."

The little girl acted like a spoiled child and forced the beef slices into his mouth. Her fingers even touched his sharp and handsome fangs.

"How sweet\!"

Chu Xiaoye held it in his mouth and secretly praised it before swallowing it.
