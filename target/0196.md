Chapter 196: The Catastrophe of the Turtle Pythons\!

Late at night, the forest was quiet.

It was the time when the mighty and handsome lion king excreted.

Chu Xiaoye found a quiet and dense bush and crawled in. He took a deep breath and sank his energy into his dantian, slowly curling his tail.

Belia thought that he was going to lie in and sleep. She immediately followed him in and opened her mouth, preparing to twist her butt while caterwauling.

In the end…

"Pfft—"

With an explosion, black smoke with a huge airflow suddenly sprayed on her face\!

The fur on her face and head flew back with a whoosh. Her entire face almost changed shape from the wind\!

Her mouth was still open stiffly.

Black smoke started to drift out of her mouth and nostrils, like an old smoker blowing out smoke rings proficiently.

"Bang\!"

She fainted on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He turned around and looked at it with a shocked expression.

This female leopard came again?

However, not only did his fart not smell better, it even smelled worse.

It seemed that the heat in his body was still modifying his body. Or, it was refining the air he breathed and the food he ate every day.

And these smelly farts were the impurities in those things.

Since farts were still smelly, where was the feces?

He ignored the unconscious little leopard and continued to excrement.

Just as he finished excreting and was about to turn around to look, the roars of the Chino brothers suddenly came from outside the bushes and the grassland near the river.

The two brothers were patrolling the territory. Now that they were roaring, they had clearly encountered an enemy.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate and immediately rushed out of the bushes.

Under the bright moonlight.

The Chino brothers were roaring at something black on the grass and looked a little afraid.

When Chu Xiaoye ran close, he realized that the dark object was a huge turtle nearly two meters long\!

The huge turtle raised its fat head and opened its mouth, revealing two rows of sharp fangs. It looked rather ferocious.

When the Chino brothers raised their claws and prepared to slap, it immediately retracted its neck back into the turtle shell.

When the Chino brothers saw that their boss was here, their courage immediately increased\!

Big Chino continued to roar in front of it, and Little Chino circled behind the giant turtle. He raised his claws and slapped hard at its shell.

"Bam\!"

With a crisp sound, the sharp claws seemed to have hit metal.

Little Chino was stunned for a moment. Before he could retract his claws, something suddenly jumped out from under the turtle shell and bit his claws\!

"Roar—"

Little Chino immediately let out a miserable scream and hurriedly swung its claws, wanting to break free\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked\!

The thing that was biting his claws was clearly the head and mouth of another turtle\!

Right at this moment, another head jumped out from in front of this huge turtle and bit Big Chino's front leg\!

Big Chino was shocked, but he did not break free. He also let out a miserable roar, clearly in extreme pain\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly rushed over. Golden light flashed from his right claw and he cut off the head that was biting Little Chino\!

Then, he immediately rushed forward and cut off the head that was biting Big Chino\!

The Chino brothers finally broke free.

At this moment, the huge turtle shell started to sway violently\!

Then, a black and thick snake suddenly crawled out from inside. As it bled on the ground, it twisted and rolled in pain. It was three meters long\!

However, it no longer had a head.

Chu Xiaoye's face was filled with shock. He immediately extended his claws and turned the still shaking turtle shell around.

There was a big hole behind the turtle shell and there was a very big space inside. The python should be coiled inside.

As for this giant turtle, although its limbs were strong and its head and neck looked very thick, its middle body was very small. It actually shared a turtle shell with this python\!

What had just bitten Little Chino's claws was not this giant turtle, but the python\!

Just as Chu Xiaoye was in disbelief, a night wind suddenly brought with it a strong smell of the sea and attacked from the river not far away.

He was shocked and looked up.

Not far away by the river, there was a black mass of giant turtles crawling towards the grassland\!

The Chino brothers clearly saw this terrifying scene as well. They immediately let out another roar and informed the two female lions to quickly come and help. An enemy had invaded.

Clearly, these things were not the creatures in the river.

They had a strong smell of the sea on them. They must have sneaked up from the sea downstream.

If there was a sea python like this hiding in every giant turtle's shell, it would be troublesome.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate and immediately went forward.

When he ran close and saw the scene in front of him, his scalp turned numb.

The densely packed giant tortoises were looking up with their fat heads and climbing out of the river. Behind their tortoise shells, black python heads stuck out and they were spitting out their scarlet tongues. They looked strange and terrifying\!

The invasion of the mutated species of the sea\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and pounced forward\!

If this species stepped onto his territory, he would probably never see another creature in his territory.

The Chino brothers, who were following behind, immediately rushed up while injured. They roared at the group of giant turtles and waved their claws, trying their best to chase them away.

However, the other party was extremely fierce and formed a mighty army. They opened their sharp teeth and let out fierce hissing sounds. Not to mention the Chino brothers, even Chu Xiaoye hurriedly retreated after killing a few.

In the river, there were still black giant turtles crawling up.

At this moment, the two female lions full of scars also heard the news and came over, roaring angrily.

Catherine was like a bolt of lightning as she came behind Chu Xiaoye.

When she clawed at the head of a huge turtle, the head suddenly shrank in\!

Catherine grabbed the turtle's shell with her claws, but her sharp claws only left a white mark on it.

At this moment, the python behind the giant turtle suddenly turned around and bit her. Its dark and thick body suddenly jumped out of the turtle shell\!

Catherine did not dodge. She grabbed at its open mouth with a whoosh and cut its mouth into two\!

"Ssss\!"

These giant turtles immediately surged over like a tidal wave\!

"Roar —"

At this moment, the strong male leopard suddenly rushed out of the bushes with his family of three to help.

The cute fierce bear and her son also ran out slowly, roaring terrifyingly.

Protecting this home was not just the responsibility of the pride\!

They were also responsible\!
