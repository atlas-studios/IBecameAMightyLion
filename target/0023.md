Chapter 23: The Lion Brothers

"Roarâ€”"

The lion roared and bared its fangs. Its face was ferocious and revealed a terrifying expression.

It looked murderous and extremely intimidating\!

However, he squatted in place and did not attack.

The hunger for the past few days and the previous hard journey had already made him feel a little weak and travel-worn.

Furthermore, he knew how cunning these enemies were.

When hyenas snatched a lion's food, they always relied on the strength of their pack to create chaos and run around. They did not attack, only harassing and provoking. The wanted to slowly drain the lion's strength by taking turns to fight him.

Once the lion was exhausted, they would rush up and snatch the food.

Sometimes, a lone lion might even be bitten to death and eaten\!

Lions and hyenas had been enemies for generations.

Regardless of whether it was the lone survivor of the other party's race or the young and weak, both sides had always killed without mercy\!

Now, the hyenas had seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity not just for food.

The pride was hungry and tired, and there were cubs that needed protection. This was a godsend opportunity\!

The lion knew clearly how cunning and vicious these enemies were. Hence, he did not foolishly charge forward and waste his energy.

The female lions protected the young cubs in the middle and also only bared their fangs to threaten them. They did not attack.

They were stalling for time to recover their strength.

With the cubs needing protection, they did not dare to split up and attack.

As for the hyenas.

Although their numbers were huge and their combat strength was not weak, they did not dare to go forward at that moment. They only circled around, making all sorts of clamoring and provocations, letting out "hehehe" sounds as if they were trying to lure the lion and lionesses to chase them.

The two sides faced each other, threatening and provoking each other with their cries.

Lars hid behind the broken-tailed lioness, shivering.

Although his body was already bigger than a hyena's, he was still a child and had no combat experience.

Furthermore, there were too many hyenas.

Mei Mei and Gigi, the two little lionesses, were also trembling in fear.

However, Little Curly Tail bared his teeth. His amber eyes were filled with anger. He looked like he was ready to pounce and bite.

Chu Xiaoye was naturally uneasy as well.

The hyenas' bite strength was astonishing, and their life force was extremely tenacious. Even if a lion were to bite their throats, they would still take a long time to suffocate and die.

They had a large pack. Even if they were injured, they could eat rotten meat with the pack or snatch the prey of other carnivores.

But the pride was different.

Whether it was the lion or the lionesses who were injured, it would be extremely dangerous for the entire pride and could even be a disaster.

With so many hyenas, if they attacked in groups, the lion and the lionesses would not be able to take care of them all.

At that time, these five young cubs would probably lose their lives\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The leading hyena queen suddenly ran around and shouted, as if she was ordering something.

The hyenas that were pacing around without moving forward immediately cried out as they approached the pride.

The male hyenas courageously approached the hunted zebra, seemingly wanting to snatch the lions' prey.

At this moment, the lion could no longer tolerate it\!

He suddenly roared and pounced at the hyenas angrily\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas reacted extremely quickly, as if they had already expected his pounce. They immediately turned around and ran away, deliberately running very slowly to lure him into chasing them.

The lion's mane fluttered as his killing intent surged. He angrily chased after the hyenas.

At this moment.

The other hyenas around them rushed forward and pounced on the lionesses and young cubs\!

The five female lions were furious and hurriedly pounced forward to bite\!

However, there were too many hyenas\!

They had too many things to handle at the same time and could not stop these cunning enemies outside the cubs.

Soon, a group of hyenas broke through their defence and charged towards the five young cubs\!

Although Lars was extremely terrified, he had no choice but to bare his fangs and pounce on these vile enemies\!

The hyenas did not fight him head-on. Instead, they circled around him and charged towards Chu Xiaoye, Mei Mei, and the other two young cubs.

After all, they looked smaller and easier to deal with.

The five female lions roared and ran back\!

The lion also turned around and roared angrily\!

The three hyenas had already arrived in front of Chu Xiaoye, Mei Mei and the other two young cubs, showing their sharp fangs and preparing to bite\!

Mei Mei and Gigi shivered all over and hid behind Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail howled angrily and pounced at a male hyena that was coming at him\!

The hyenas were matriarchal, and male hyenas were generally smaller than female hyenas.

And this hyena was about the size of Little Curly Tail.

It originally thought that this young cub would tremble in fear and wait for death or retaliate slightly. Unexpectedly, this young cub actually bared its sharp fangs and took the initiative to pounce at an extremely fast speed\!

The male hyena was frightened. It hurriedly stopped in its tracks and ran to the side\!

On the other side\!

When the two male hyenas ran in front of Chu Xiaoye, they opened their mouths and prepared to pounce on him and bite his neck. However, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and used his two claws to attack. "Smack\! Smack\!" Two crisp sounds were heard. They were as fast as lightning and as heavy as lead. He directly slapped the two male hyenas, who were of his size, to the ground\!

The two male hyenas crawled on the ground, their heads buzzing. After struggling for a few times, they could not get up\!

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to jump up and bite the neck of a male hyena\!

Two rows of teeth were fiercely embedded in its throat\!

As for the other male hyena, it seemed to be frightened. It jumped up with a whoosh and turned to flee in panic\!

At this moment.

The five female lions and the male lion had already roared and rushed back\!

The other hyenas that were about to charge over cried out when they saw this and fled in all directions\!

Little Curly Tail chased after the escaping hyena. His courage increased as he wagged his tail excitedly\!

Aisha rushed over and stopped him.

If he chased into the hyena pack, no one could save him\!

Chu Xiaoye bit hard on the hyena's throat and refused to let go no matter how hard it struggled\!

The male lion and female lion gathered together, surrounding the young cubs in the middle.

As for the zebra that the female lions had hunted painstakingly, it was dragged away by a group of female hyenas in the chaos. Soon, it was bitten to pieces and flesh splattered everywhere\!

The other hyenas rushed forward to take a share of the prey\!

The lion roared angrily, but could only stand in place and watch helplessly as his prey was shared by the enemy. His abdomen heaved violently and he panted heavily.

He no longer had the strength to fight over it.

The female lions also looked angrily and resentfully at this group of shameless and despicable enemies.

Soon.

The entire zebra was divided up by the thirty plus hyenas\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

"Hehehehehe\!"

After eating the prey that they had snatched, the hyenas let out ugly cries of triumph.

Then, they left one after another.

After testing, the combat strength of this pride of lions was still very strong.

Since they had already snatched the prey and won, there was no need for them to take the risk of being killed and continue fighting.

As for the companion that fell, no one cared.

Not to mention a companion, they would not even care if it was their own siblings. They would even kill each other.

From the moment they were born, they learned how to be cruel and kill.

No matter who they were facing.

The hyenas left triumphant.

The lions, on the other hand, were bathing in the golden sunset, still immersed in lingering anger and frustration.

The prey was gone and the children were almost killed.

No one would forget this hatred\!

The hyena left behind finally stopped breathing.

Chu Xiaoye loosened his mouth and spat a few mouthfuls of blood at its face. He even raised his hind legs and peed on its face.

Little Curly Tail also raised his legs to pee excitedly.

The male lion, the female lions, and the other cubs looked at the brothers and the dead hyena on the ground.

Aisha's eyes were filled with relief and pride.

Their father, the lion, looked at them coldly and warily.

They were a pair of lions.

Although they were young, they would grow up in the end.
