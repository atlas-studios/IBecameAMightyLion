Chapter 32: Storing Food

After dawn.

The four female lions set out to hunt.

Callie stayed behind to guard her home and cubs with the lion.

However.

Perhaps the lion was too confident.

The calmness of the past few days and the cries that came out when he bit the hyena to death last night made him believe that under his deterrence, no enemy dared to invade his territory again.

Therefore, after the four female lions walked far away, he left the camp with Callie and went to the distant grassland to be loving and intimate.

Callie had lost her children and was now in her estrus period, and was subservient to his every wish.

In the pride's camp, there were only five cubs left.

Lars's body was already very big and he looked stronger than his mother.

However, be it his courage, hunting skills, or all sorts of survival skills, he was still a child.

He still had many things to learn.

At this moment, he was sleeping in the grass, waiting for the lionesses to return from hunting to eat a delicious breakfast.

Mei Mei was the youngest of the five cubs and was only seven months old.

In another month or two, when the female lions went out to hunt, they might be brought along.

At that time, not only could they learn the hunting skills of the female lions on the spot, they could also enjoy their prey on the spot. They would no longer have to wait at home for the leftovers from the female lions.

At this moment.

Chu Xiaoye was busy under the tree.

He constantly bit off soft branches from the bushes, brought them up the Baobab tree, and placed them on the branches high up.

He planned to build a larger storage room on the tree and hide all the dried food in it.

It was not good to hang them on the tree blatantly.

It was inevitable that some thieves would drool after seeing them and covet his food.

Furthermore, as the prey increased, he was afraid that the pride would suspect him of being a freak.

He was still underage and could catch prey every day. Furthermore, the prey he brought back had all been stung by venomous bees. They were also made to be so dry that they could not be eaten.

This was not only strange, but also crazy.

Hence, Chu Xiaoye thought about it carefully. He still had to quietly proceed with the storage of food.

However, this matter could not be hidden from Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

These two fellas had become his lackeys. Other than when sleeping, they were inseparable.

Of course, when farting and pooping, they did not dare to follow him no matter what. 

Chu Xiaoye was very depressed.

From the beginning to now, the farts and poop he let out did not show any signs of improvement.

Even he could not take it sometimes.

It was dark and smelly.

It was a tragic sight\!

The heat in his stomach kept flowing in his body.

Every time he ate and drank his fill, he felt the heat become more active.

It seemed that modification of the body and excrement of trash were happening every day. It was not something that happened in a day or two.

He did not know when his situation would end.

But fortunately, he was a lion.

In the future, he only needed to be strong to have everything on the grassland.

This included a vast territory and many young and beautiful wives and concubines.

If it were other animals, no one would want him when they came of age and were looking for mates.

Who could tolerate his stinky farts and poop that were comparable to poisonous gas?

"Roar\!"

Just as he was busy biting the branches and climbing up and down, Little Curly Tail stood on the tree and shouted angrily at Mei Mei.

Although the two little fellows did not understand what he was doing, they had been following behind him and helping him transport the branches.

However, when Mei Mei climbed up the tree with the branch in her mouth, she stood on the branch in a daze and did not come down.

Little Curly Tail thought that she was being lazy and was reprimanding her angrily.

Chu Xiaoye bit on a branch and climbed up the tree. He saw Mei Mei looking up at the distant grassland with a dazed look.

Chu Xiaoye put down the branch and looked up. On the grassland in the distance, his father, the strong male lion, was riding on Callie and trembling.

As for Callie, she was crawling on the ground, looking pitiful as if she was being bullied.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his claw and slapped Meimei's butt, asking her to go down and help transport the branches.

No wonder this girl was standing there motionless.

She had seen a scene that was not suitable for children\!

Mei Mei's body trembled from his slap and she immediately came to her senses. She quickly retracted her gaze and climbed down the tree, not daring to look at him and Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail followed her with a look of disdain.

Gigi was originally beating butterflies in the grass at the side. Seeing that they had been biting the branches in the bushes and seemed to be having fun, she immediately followed them and helped to bite the branches.

The branches nearby could block the sun and be used as shade. Furthermore, they could also emit a humid aura.

If they were all bitten off, the pride's camp would be even more hot and unbearable.

Hence, Chu Xiaoye brought the three little fellows to a place dozens of meters away.

There were many bushes there, and soft and tough branches were everywhere. They were also full of green leaves. If he placed them on the tree, he could even feel a breeze when he slept on the tree at night.

Chu Xiaoye let the three little fellows transport the branches. He waited under the tree and placed it properly with his mouth. When there were enough, he would slowly weave it.

Actually, the so-called weaving was simply to first lay the branches horizontally on the wide branch, and then step on them. The soft branches immediately bent down from the middle, forming a nest.

When the branches gradually increased, a storage room that was as big as a bird's nest formed.

At that time, he would continue to increase the height of the surroundings until he covered the top as well and turned it into a large ball. He would be done after making an opening at the side.

Of course, since it was a storage room, this ball had to be very big.

Fortunately, the five branches on this Baobab tree were thick and strong enough to withstand it.

The softness and tenacity of these branches should also be able to withstand the weight of those food.

He decided to make three storage rooms first.

Of course, this project could not be completed in a day or two.

If he took out a few hours every day to work, it would only be done in over half a month.

This work could also train their endurance, strength, climbing skills, and the strength of their teeth.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye bit on three branches and climbed up the tree while panting. Then, he called out to the three little fellows below to let them rest for a while.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei lay under the tree.

Gigi was having fun.

Although she was a little tired, today was her first time showing off in front of the three siblings\!

Her relationship with them seemed to have become even closer.

The three of them seemed to have accepted her.

Therefore, she did not care about her fatigue and continued to pull herself together. She turned around and crawled into the bushes to pick the branches diligently.

In the forest not far away, a group of cunning and cruel killers was lurking along the dense grass.

That was their arch enemiesâ€”the spotted hyenas\!
