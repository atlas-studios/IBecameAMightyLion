Chapter 206: Invincible Golden Claw\!

The snow turned red and corpses covered the ground.

The scar-faced lion king probably never would have thought that he would die under a fart.

Chu Xiaoye dragged the snow deer's corpse into the distance.

He invited Catherine to eat with him again.

However, this lioness cub that killed lions without blinking still considered herself a subject or servant. She lowered her head and stood respectfully behind him.

Blue the male leopard admired and was puzzled.

The little lioness was so strong and her personality was extremely vicious, but why did she have to submit and be so gentle to this young king?

It was definitely not just because of his strength.

He could not understand the specific relationship and feelings of these two young lions.

Chu Xiaoye ate half and left half.

He knew that this lioness cub's appetite was not much smaller than his.

Catherine looked at the snow deer thigh he left behind and thought of how she could eat the thigh of a prey he abandoned every night when she was most lonely and helpless.

She had survived until now because of the food he deliberately left behind.

She ate with relish, just like how she was so greedy and happy when she hid in the grass at night in the past.

"Roar —"

Right at this moment, an angry roar suddenly came from the snow forest\!

Then, more than ten huge white bears rushed out of the snow forest aggressively.

One of them was the white bear that had fainted after knocking into the tree\!

These white bears were all extremely strong, tall, and fierce. Their strong and thick limbs moved through the snow as if they were walking on flat ground. When they ran, they ran as if they were flying\!

Blue, the male leopard, was the closest to the tree. When he saw this scene, he hurriedly climbed up the nearby tree.

Chu Xiaoye saw that these fellows were murderous and ran very quickly. They arrived in the blink of an eye and knew that they could not escape with their running speed here. He immediately climbed up the tree with Catherine.

When he counted carefully, there were actually twelve white bears\!

Bear species were generally like leopards, living alone. Be it foraging or fighting, they would fight alone. However, for some reason, they suddenly gathered and formed an alliance.

Under the lead of the white bear with its head blooming, these white bears quickly ran under the tree that Chu Xiaoye and Catherine were hiding in. They raised their heads and let out angry roars.

The twelve white bears all raised their front limbs and stood up, roaring one after another.

Obviously, they had come to take revenge for their companion.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on a branch and lowered his head to look at the group of big fellows. He slapped the tree trunk with his claws and the leaves immediately swayed. Snow rustled down and landed on the faces and heads of these white bears.

"Roar —"

Seeing his provocation, the white bears became even more furious. They ran to the tree and started to climb.

He did not expect that with their huge and heavy bodies, they could climb up the tree easily and were very fast.

However, just as they climbed up the branch, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine suddenly jumped up. One after another, they landed on another big tree more than ten meters away like two agile monkeys.

"Roar —"

The few white bears waiting under the tree immediately roared and rushed over.

The few white bears that climbed up the tree were stunned for a moment before they could only retreat again.

When the few white bears rushed under the tree, Chu Xiaoye started to slap the tree trunk heavily again. The snow that fell from the branches and leaves fell on their heads.

This humiliation and provocation immediately made the group of white bears roar in anger and start to climb the tree again.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Catherine and immediately got up to climb towards the highest branch.

The few white bears that had climbed up the tree roared as they chased relentlessly.

When they climbed up high, the straight and thin tree trunk started to be unable to withstand their weight and gradually bent.

The few white bears immediately froze and did not dare to move.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, who were lying at the highest point, they looked to be in even more danger and were about to fall.

A white bear suddenly thought of a solution. It growled and let its companion retreat first. Then, it started to hug the tree trunk and shake it desperately.

Just as it was shaking with all its might, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down. His right claw flashed with golden light and he fell from behind it\!

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye grabbed a branch at the bottom and hung there.

The white bear that was shaking the branch at the top suddenly stopped and froze.

Then, a bloody line suddenly appeared on its head, back, and tail. With a puff, blood sprayed out\!

His flesh was overturned and his bones were revealed\!

It loosened its limbs and fell from the top of the tree with a whoosh. It fell heavily into the snow and died on the spot\!

The bright red quickly dyed the snow red, and the roars on the tree stopped.

At this moment, there were still three white bears on the branch at the waist of the tree. They were at a loss when they saw this scene.

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and Chu Xiaoye actually cut off a branch beside him\!

The three white bears immediately trembled in fear.

At this moment, Catherine, who was hiding on the top of the tree, suddenly climbed down silently and stopped above the head of a white bear.

When the white bear reacted and raised its head, Catherine's sharp claws pierced into its head at lightning speed. With a whoosh, she actually tore off half of its skull\!

"Roar —"

The white bear suddenly let out a miserable scream. Then, its vision turned black and its body turned limp. It fell from the tree and smashed heavily into the snow, instantly dying.

Catherine's bloody claws flickered with a silver luster under the sun and mixed with the scarlet blood. It was surprisingly beautiful.

The other two white bears crawling on the tree were terrified and hurriedly retreated.

However, on the first branch below, there was another young lion waiting for them.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch and did not look up at them. Instead, he swung his golden claws and pierced them into the tree trunk above him. With a whoosh, he actually tore off the thick bark and a piece of wood under the bark\!

Now, his golden claws seemed to have become even sharper.

"Chi\!"

He swung his claws again and started to empty the tree trunk\!

Although the eight white bears under the tree were roaring continuously, they seemed to be terrified by the two dead white bears on the ground. They only dared to roar under the tree but did not dare to come up again.

Chu Xiaoye started to quickly tear the tree trunk above him. In a few moves, he emptied half of the thick tree trunk.

The sharpness and toughness of these golden claws exceeded his expectations. They tore at the hard tree trunk as if they were tearing cotton and actually did not take much effort.

The entire tree started to sway.

"Roar—"

He raised his head and called out to Catherine, who was at the top, to let her leave quickly.

He had to try out these two newly evolved golden claws.

"Whoosh—"

Catherine jumped up and nimbly landed on a big tree beside her.

As for the two white bears that were still trapped on the tree, they fought and wanted to come down. However, every time the tree swayed, they would immediately freeze in place and tremble.

"Crack\!"

The trees started to make sounds that were about to break.

Chu Xiaoye raised his golden claw and suddenly grabbed\!

"Boom\!"

The entire tree above him suddenly broke and fell\!

The two white bears crawling on it were terrified. They loosened their claws and fell down first\!

"Bang\!"

Their huge and heavy bodies fell heavily onto the snow and they fell into a deep pit. Just as they struggled to get up, the fallen tree happened to smash into their heads with a bang and buried them in the snow, never to move again.

"Roar —"

Seeing this scene, the other white bears under the tree did not dare to stay any longer and immediately roared and fled in panic.

Chu Xiaoye looked at his sharp golden claws that were shining under the sun and suddenly felt heroic\!

With these invincible golden claws, even if he could not become a super lion king worshipped by thousands of beasts in the future, he could still become a woodcutter that terrified all animals\!

This was invincibility\!
