Chapter 57: Defeated Without a Battle

"Bam\!"

When the leopard and daughter vomited, a gazelle that they had dragged to the tree fell down and landed in the grass.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye thanked her and walked over rudely. He picked up the prey in his mouth and left.

"Roar\! Roar\! Ugh —"

On the tree, Belita cried out angrily and vomited.

This bastard was too much\!

It was bad enough that he disgusted them, but he actually took advantage of them and snatched their prey\!

Shameless\!

Chu Xiaoye did not stop. He picked up his prey and left quickly.

The noses of this leopard and her daughter were too sensitive. The poisonous gas did not even drift over.

Perhaps they were frightened by the black smoke or the pitiful state of the lionesses.

To be honest, he really did not think it smelled that bad.

At least, he could tolerate it.

However, that little leopard was really polite. Every time they met, she would give him gifts and smell his farts. He was very embarrassed.

Dawn appeared on the distant horizon.

A night passed quietly.

When they were about to reach the camp, Chu Xiaoye stopped in his tracks and placed the prey in his mouth on the ground. He used his sharp teeth to tear off the thigh of the prey and threw it in the grass.

He thought for a moment and bit on the thigh again.

Then, he returned to the camp with the prey in his mouth and climbed up the Baobab tree.

Catherine woke up.

When he returned with the prey in his mouth, she suddenly woke up.

Catherine suddenly stood up and looked up at his agile figure climbing up the tree with his prey in his mouth. She was instantly vexed.

Damn it, why did I fall asleep\!

Indeed, he still went. He still went hunting.

Unfortunately, she fell asleep.

She felt terrible.

At the same time, the hunger in her stomach grew stronger.

She wondered if he had wasted food tonight.

This was a bad habit.

In her entire life, she had never seen an animal waste food.

Especially carnivores. Every time they ate, they almost licked the flesh that was in the mud clean.

Every one of their kind was so greedy and hungry.

However, he subverted her understanding.

He was like a rich man who never had to worry about food and drink. No matter how good the food was, he would throw it away after a few bites. He never had a trace of longing or heartache.

If it were any other species, she would definitely look down on them very much.

But towards him, she only felt gratitude and admiration.

Without him, she would not be where she was now.

He was the reason why she could survive alone in this pride.

No matter what he did, he was always so outstanding and fascinating in her eyes.

Furthermore, he really did not need to worry about food.

He was so brave, so strong, so calm and confident. His every move was filled with charm.

Catherine raised her head and hid in the dense bushes. Her eyes were infatuated as she secretly looked at the figure on the tree. She was like a self-abased little fangirl who was peeping at her idol.

Dawn finally arrived.

A ray of sunlight rose from the distant horizon of the grassland and fell on the dense forest.

The figure on the Baobab tree was illuminated in golden light.

That was her light.

However, she was really hungry.

She reluctantly retracted her gaze, turned around, and walked towards the bushes at the back.

She did not walk far before she suddenly smelled a sweet scent of blood.

In the grass not far away, a fresh prey's thigh fell, as if it had just been ripped off its prey.

Catherine was overjoyed. She ran over excitedly and lay in the grass, her heart filled with bliss and gratitude.

She ate with relish.

As she ate, she imagined the heroic scene when he first came to hunt.

She regretted not following him just now and not seeing his strong and charming figure.

Hundreds of meters in front of her.

Beside the newly marked borderline of the Seno brothers, the lioness who had fainted finally woke up faintly.

Then, she fainted again.

The morning sun shone into the bushes and onto the black unknown objects. It started to slowly bake the water and smell inside.

The hot breeze was still flowing towards the territory of the Seno brothers' pride.

An invisible but even more smelly smell drifted silently towards the territory of the bushes that the Seno brothers had recently occupied.

Out of the seven female lions, one fainted. The remaining six had long disappeared.

When the Seno brothers finished patrolling the territory and returned to the bushes, they did not see any female lions. However, they suddenly smelled an unknown smell that made them instantly bristle\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

Before the brothers could react, their stomachs suddenly churned. They opened their mouths and vomited\!

When they opened their mouths to vomit, more and more terrifying stench crawled into their mouths\!

"Ouch—Ugh —"

The two lions wanted to roar angrily and see what was happening, but they were vomiting non-stop from the smell. Soon, their limbs were trembling, and they were dizzy. They became terrified\!

"Whoosh—"

They fled.

It was noon and the sun was shining brightly.

The stench in the bushes grew stronger.

Many animals did not dare to approach.

The brothers, on the other hand, finally found the six female lions that had escaped. They brought them back aggressively, wanting to find the enemy and take revenge\!

However, just as they returned to the camp, they ran away again.

The six female lions ran first.

The Seno brothers followed closely. As they ran, they roared angrily, as if they wanted to use the lion's roar to deter the enemy, so that the smelly enemy whose origins they did not know could get lost quickly\!

In the evening.

They regrouped again and charged back aggressively. They charged into the bushes with a murderous aura, wanting to fight the smelly enemy to the death\!

At this moment, the lioness, who had been unconscious for a day, finally woke up slowly.

Her sense of smell seemed to be numb. She rolled unconsciously, causing her entire body to be covered in black unknown objects.

She stood up shakily and left in a daze.

Coincidentally, the Seno brothers brought six female lions over\!

The female lion immediately felt extremely wronged. She immediately let out a sorrowful roar and went up to them. She licked and rubbed against the Seno Brothers, as if she was seeking comfort or complaining that she wanted them to make a decision for her.

The leaf with the black object in her mouth landed on little Seno's face.

Her entire body was emitting a terrifying stench\!

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

"Ugh —"

The Seno brothers' pride that was still aggressive and murderous a second ago immediately dispersed in the next second\!

They vomited as they fled, their faces filled with fear.

As for the lioness with a horrible stench, she was not self-aware and ran away with them in a hurry.

Soon, the Seno brothers' pride disappeared back into the boundless grassland.

The sun had yet to set.

A mosquito covered in patterns followed the stench and landed in front of the black objects.

Then.

Its body grew larger and larger.
