Chapter 388: Untitled

The grassland was not the only thing that was destroyed by the disaster.

Behind this group of white wolves, there were a few nests of snow-white cubs. Some were still crawling, and some were already dead.

The female wolf's embrace did not look warm, nor could it comfort the terrified and helpless hearts of the cubs that had fled all the way.

They were still terrified and trembling.

The wolf pack protected their wives and cubs firmly. All their panic and fear seemed to have been used up last night. Now, they were exceptionally desperate. It seemed that they had already ignored life and death.

It turned out that the wolves were not blocking the way to take revenge, but protecting their families.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the snow-white wolf cubs and did not disturb them anymore. He brought the pride and circled around via the forest at the side.

Little Curly Tail's restlessness instantly stopped.

The wolf pack, who had originally planned to risk their lives, stood there quietly and watched their retreating backs in a daze. For a moment, they were at a loss.

The ferocious pride actually took the initiative to leave.

Perhaps they were tired too.

The rugged mountain path was not easy to walk on.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and walked halfway up the mountain before stopping to rest.

The pride was tired and hungry.

Before the disaster last night, they had not eaten for many days. Their arduous escape last night had exhausted all their energy.

If they did not replenish their food, the pride would not be able to move forward.

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled and he pushed the little girl off his back. He looked at her fiercely and deliberately drooled, as if he was saying, "If I can't find food again, I'll eat you\!"

The little girl got up from the ground and blinked her beautiful big eyes. She walked in front of him and removed the socks on his neck. She used her small hands to gently stroke the golden mane on his neck and encouraged, "King, believe in yourself. You can definitely find food."

Chu Xiaoye wanted to laugh, but how could he laugh in this situation?

He ignored this human girl and turned to roar at Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, Mixed Fur, and Blue Eyes. He split into two teams and went to the nearby forest to find prey.

The other members stayed in place to protect the weak members of the team.

The cold father was unwilling to accept this and wanted to follow and help hunt in order to show that he was still young and heroic. However, after being glared at by Chu Xiaoye, he could only stay obediently like a grandson.

The forest was damp and dark. Towering trees were everywhere, thick and lush. Even if there was sunlight, it was covered tightly.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei to search in another direction.

Blue eyes and Mixed Fur followed another path.

The Jiela sisters, who had stayed in place, and the six female lions took the initiative to search the forest around the pride. They did not dare to walk too far.

Aisha and the others could not help but join the team.

Everyone was extremely hungry and could not wait for dinner.

The Jerry brothers stayed in place dutifully and followed Chu Xiaoye's orders meticulously.

After the cold father was glared at by his unfilial son, he obediently lay on the ground and pretended to sleep with his eyes narrowed, but he was cursing in his heart.

In this unfamiliar primitive forest, not only did Qiqi and Nunu need protection, the other members were also uneasy.

After all, it was not a grassland. Its vision was wide and it could discover enemies early. Here, the trees were lush, the bushes were deep, and the terrain was complicated. No one knew what would jump out of the grass.

Pit still could not change its habit of digging holes.

As long as they stopped, he would start digging holes. Otherwise, he would feel insecure.

The other two strong warthogs dug the roots of plants in the surrounding soil to fill their stomachs.

Just as Little Mi was wandering in the bushes at the side, she suddenly heard a familiar voice.

He immediately lowered his body and quickly walked over.

In the grass two meters ahead, a three-meter-long cobra was entangled with a green python.

The python was thick and about five meters long. It looked much stronger than the cobra, but at this moment, the python could only flee in panic.

The cobra fought it while spitting venom to bite its body.

The python struggled to climb in front of a small tree and started to use this small tree to perform its ultimate skills. Its thick body wrapped around the cobra and wrapped around the tree, wanting to strangle the other party with its strangulation force.

However, the cobra's venom seemed to have already invaded its body. It became slower and weaker.

Suddenly, the cobra followed its body and climbed onto its head. It suddenly bit its head and started to eat.

The python's body started to struggle with all its might, but it was useless.

Soon, this native python that lived in this primitive forest became food for this foreign invader.

However, the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind\!

Before the cobra could continue devouring the python, Brother Flat Top, Little Mi, jumped out of the grass with a whoosh and bit the bottom of the cobra's head\!

He was really as fast as lightning and arrived in an instant\!

The cobra did not have the time to react before its fate was sealed\!

The cobra was rather embarrassed. It was opening its mouth and expanding its throat to eat the python's head. Under its throat, it was bitten by the honey badger and could not move.

The cobra's tail started to twist and swing as it slapped Brother Flat Top's butt hard. However, it did not have much strength. To Brother Flat Top, it was like scratching an itch.

Soon, the cobra that hunted pythons suffocated to death.

Little Mi bit for a while more before letting go of his teeth and starting to eat from the cobra's tail. Blood flowed out from his mouth as flesh rolled and he ate with relish.

In a moment, he ate the three-meter-long cobra.

Little Mi twisted his head and moved his muscles. He bit the python's head and dragged it into the bushes towards the camp where the pride was stationed.

The two warthogs that were eating the roots of plants were immediately frightened by the big python rustling in the grass. However, when they saw that the python was already dead, the two warthogs also revealed a coveting look.

Strictly speaking, warthogs were not complete vegetarians. They would occasionally eat meat. When there was a lack of food, they would even eat rotten meat.

However, Little Mi ignored them. He dragged the python to Pit, who was digging a pit and gestured for him to eat.

Pit had already crawled into the pit and was working hard with its butt stuck out. It did not have the time to care about him.

Qiqi and Nunu walked over curiously, but they looked like cowards. They wanted to approach, but they did not dare to walk too close.

Little Mi looked at them and bit off the python's head. He chewed until blood flowed.

A python without a head did not look that terrifying.

The strong smell of blood stimulated the hungry Qiqi and Nunu.

The two little fellows immediately drooled as they walked over.

Right at this moment, the python without a head suddenly raised its tail and started moving\!
