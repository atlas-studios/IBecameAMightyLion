Chapter 226: Little White Tiger

"Roar —"

When the little white tiger came in front of the big white tiger, the big white tiger saw that Chu Xiaoye was still hiding on the tree and not coming down. It immediately roared angrily and raised its huge claws, looking at him threateningly.

As long as she slashed, the entire tree would break.

As for Chu Xiaoye, who was hiding on the tree, even if he did not die from the fall, he would at least be crippled\!

The little white tiger stood beside its mother and also raised its head to look at Chu Xiaoye on the tree. Its round eyes were filled with curiosity.

She was probably wondering what this fellow with dyed blond hair was. Could it be a new toy her mother gave her?

"Roar\!"

The little white tiger mimicked its mother and called out ferociously, but its voice was childish and did not have any might.

She raised her upper body and lay on the tree. As she roared, she climbed up.

His movements looked extremely agile.

The big white tiger was frightened. It hurriedly bit her neck and brought her down.

The tree was about to break. She did not dare to let this silly girl die.

Furthermore, the kid on the tree had sharp claws and was ruthless. He was not a good person.

"Roar —"

The big white tiger continued to roar and raised its huge claws again, staring coldly at the tree.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch with his head lowered and looked down at them. He rejected them firmly.

He, the dignified king of lions, could not degrade himself and associate with a little white tiger that smelled like milk\!

Be it being a bodyguard or a nanny, it was a huge humiliation.

He would rather die than submit\!

"Bang\!"

The female tiger, Dora, was furious. She suddenly slapped the tree trunk hard\!

"Crack\!"

The entire tree suddenly broke.

However, Chu Xiaoye jumped up and flew across the sky like a big bird, landing on another big tree not far away.

Just as he lowered his head and was about to mock it proudly, he saw a white shadow flash. The big white tiger actually instantly jumped onto this tree. In the blink of an eye, it climbed up and stopped in front of him, looking at him covetously.

It turned out that the other party had long seen through his intentions.

Just as he jumped up, this female tiger rushed under the tree at an extremely fast speed. It was actually about the same speed as his jump from the air and arrived instantly\!

And this female tiger's ability to climb trees was so strong that it exceeded his expectations\!

At this moment, this huge female tiger was inches away from him. Her muscles were tense, and she was like a dormant killer, preparing to attack and kill him at any time.

The thick tree trunk was bent slightly by her heavy body, making Chu Xiaoye, who was high up, feel like he was walking on thin ice.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in fear. He never thought that this female tiger's strength would be so abnormal.

He knew that he could not jump to another tree now.

That was because as long as he dared to jump, the other party would dare to jump and tear him apart in midair.

Now, he might be able to use the golden claw to fight to the death.

However, was it worth it?

If he was not careful, he would be torn to pieces. The other party's claws that were like scimitars were not made of paper and were many times longer than his golden claws.

He had no need to risk his life.

The other party clearly did not want to take his life and only wanted him to surrender.

He was the dignified king of lions, and a man. He naturally had to know when to yield and when to stand tall. What was a little grievance worth?

Small case\!

"Roar\!"

At this moment, the little white tiger also climbed up and squeezed beside her mother. It stared at him curiously with its round eyes and pretended to bare its teeth and roar fiercely to scare him.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to slap her and give her a concussion.

However, at the thought that magnanimous people did not remember the mistakes of villains and that adults did not stoop to the level of children, he could only give up.

"What are you doing?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the big white tiger in front of him and asked vigilantly.

The female tiger, Dora, seemed to understand his gaze. She turned her head and looked at her daughter, Luo Mei. Her gaze was gentle as she stuck out her tongue and licked her daughter's head. Then, she looked at him.

She seemed to be saying, "Do you understand?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he flew into a rage.

Do you want this King to be your daughter's personal barber and comb her hair every day with his tongue?

Dream on\!

She had gone too far\!

Chu Xiaoye glared\!

This King would rather die\!

"Roar —"

"Roar\!"

The mother-daughter pair immediately roared together with fierce expressions.

Chu Xiaoye stuck out his tongue and climbed down a few steps. He licked the little white tiger's head, indicating that this task suited his intentions. He had liked to lick since young.

The little white tiger, Luo Mei, narrowed her eyes in comfort with a look of enjoyment.

Chu Xiaoye took the opportunity to spit, but at the thought that his saliva was a rare treasure, he immediately licked it back.

The female tiger, Dora, looked at his feet and then at the golden fur on his neck. Her eyes flickered with a cunning look.

Chu Xiaoye climbed down the tree with them.

In front of the cave not far away, Letty stood there and looked at him with a complicated gaze.

She already understood the female tiger's true intentions.

Therefore, she was no longer worried about the safety of this young lion.

She was just a little surprised. This white tiger's intelligence and thoughts were too advanced and a little absurd.

However, she did not know that this had happened before.

Dora looked at her coldly and threatened her not to speak nonsense. Otherwise, she would chase her and her two children out.

Letty immediately lowered her head in obedience.

Now, only this place could protect her children.

"Roar\!"

The little white tiger, Luo Mei, jumped around Chu Xiaoye, looking extremely excited.

She liked this new toy very much, especially the golden fur on his neck. It was extremely beautiful.

She stretched her neck, stuck out her tongue, and licked the golden fur. Then, she lowered her head and placed it in front of Chu Xiaoye, letting him lick it too.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He really wanted to slap her, but looking at the female tiger glaring at him, he felt that as a man, how could he bully a child? Hence, he stuck out his tongue and licked it.

"Roar\!"

The little white tiger was extremely happy. It turned around and aimed its butt at him.

Chu Xiaoye was furious.

At this moment, the female tiger walked over quickly and slapped the little white tiger's butt. She growled and reprimanded it sternly.

"Girls have to be reserved\! Don't scare him when you've only met for the first time\! Wait until you're familiar with each other."

The little white tiger obediently turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye with a burning gaze, its eyes filled with anticipation.

Almost every carnivore's tribe had a strict hierarchy. The weak cleaned the fur of the strong, and the low-level served the high-level.

The little white tiger thought that the new toy her mother gave her was actually a serviceer.

Dora looked at her daughter and did not explain anything. She growled at Chu Xiaoye, turned around, and walked into the depths of the forest.

"Roar\!"

The little white tiger immediately roared at Chu Xiaoye, told him to follow her and not to fall behind\!

Chu Xiaoye followed behind the mother and daughter, secretly scheming how to escape.

In the depths of the forest, the snow was deep and the road was rugged. Furthermore, the terrain was unfamiliar. To him, walking was extremely inconvenient. It was naturally even more difficult to escape.

He quietly memorized the direction along the way and secretly left urine as a mark.

They climbed up the hill, passed through the forest, and came to a mountain stream.

The stream flowed from top to bottom, and there were weathered rocks everywhere. This place was covered in caves, and the terrain was extremely complicated.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly smelled an unfamiliar scent.

It seemed that this white tiger mother and daughter were not the only ones in this forest. There were other white tiger members.

If he encountered other white tigers, it would be even more hopeless to escape.

Fortunately, this female tiger did not continue forward. Instead, she brought him to a cave by the mountain stream.

The forest was covered in snow and was damp to begin with. Furthermore, this place was adjacent to the stream and should be even more humid. However, this cave was extremely dry and clean and spacious. There were actually a few holes inside.

Chu Xiaoye followed the mother and daughter into the cave and realized that there was a thick layer of animal fur on the ground, but he did not know what animal it was.

In the corner of the cave, there were many light blue rocks filled with strange patterns and densely packed small holes that looked like needle eyes.

Chu Xiaoye curiously extended his claws and touched it. In the end, the stone suddenly broke open and was filled with water.

It turned out that the reason why this cave was dry was that these rocks could absorb the water in the air.

The female tiger, Dora, brought him into the innermost cave, signaling him to sleep here in the future.

"Roar\!"

The little white tiger roared at him and gestured for him to follow him. It brought him to a cave at the side. It was covered in thick animal fur. The corner was filled with rocks of all colors, many animal bones, and a stone wall that was as smooth as a mirror.

The little white tiger stood in front of the stone wall proudly and looked at itself inside. Then, it turned its head to look at him and let him go over, like a child showing off his toy to his little friend.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the stone wall and stood with her. He looked at himself in the mirror in a daze.

This was the first time he was looking at himself so clearly.

He had once seen it in the river, but it was not so clear.

It looked comical and the golden fur on its neck was especially striking.

It formed a sharp contrast when standing beside this white female tiger.

The other party's fur was pure, like a proud little princess. As for him, his fur was messy. Other than the golden hair on his neck, the fur elsewhere was withered yellow. He looked like a pitiful tramp or country bumpkin.

When the little white tiger saw him standing there in a daze, it thought that he was stunned by its toy and was extremely pleased.

The female tiger, Dora, looked at them and turned to walk out.

In her territory, this cub would not dare to do anything out of line.

She needed to rest for a while.

"Roar —"

However, just as she lay down at the entrance of the cave, her daughter's childish roar suddenly came from inside.

She suddenly stood up and ran over\!

When she came to her daughter's cave with a murderous aura, she realized that her daughter was lying on the ground with her eyes narrowed, enjoying the cub licking her fur.

It turned out to be a comfortable roar.

Dora heaved a sigh of relief and turned to leave.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, just as she left, Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his claws and slapped the little white tiger's head\!

The little white tiger was furious and roared again.

Chu Xiaoye immediately stuck out his tongue and licked it again. He smiled apologetically, indicating that he did not mean to do so and begging for forgiveness.

Seeing that he licked it comfortably and had a sincere attitude, the little white tiger could only give up again.

When Dora rushed over again, it still saw its daughter lying on the ground with her eyes narrowed and a look of enjoyment on her face.

As for the little lion, its attitude was extremely respectful and obedient, and it licked it with great care.

It turned out to be another comfortable roar.

Dora looked at her daughter reproachfully and turned to leave again.

"Roar —"

When she lay down at the entrance of the cave again, her daughter's roar suddenly came from inside.

Dora closed her eyes and ignored her.

At this moment, in the cave, Chu Xiaoye was riding on the little white tiger and attacking her. He slapped her face, her head, and her butt and slapped her until she cried out and could not retaliate\!

After slapping it, Chu Xiaoye flicked out his golden claw with a whoosh and placed it on the little white tiger's face. The sharp tip of his claw almost touched the little white tiger's eyes.

The little white tiger shivered in fear and did not dare to roar again.

Chu Xiaoye bit her ear and let out a threatening voice in his throat, warning her that if she dared to be impudent to him again and complain to that big female tiger again, he would scratch her face and blind her eyes\!

The little white tiger trembled and whimpered for mercy.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye put away his claws and slapped her butt. He clamped his four legs on her and growled, letting her carry him like a horse.

The little white tiger could only stand up and carry him around the cave.

Chu Xiaoye patted her butt and urged her to walk faster while listening to the sounds outside vigilantly.

The little white tiger's eyes were filled with tears of grievance. It finally could not help but roar. Its voice was miserable and painful, as if it had suffered a huge humiliation.

When the female tiger, Dora, who was resting at the entrance of the cave, heard this roar, she opened her eyes.

She hesitated for a moment, but was still a little worried. She immediately stood up and walked over.

When she came to the cave inside, she was shocked to discover that her daughter was riding on the back of the little lion, treating it as a horse.

The little lion was crying in grievance, looking like it had nothing to live for.

"This girl\!"

This was too much bullying\!

He was a future lion king with golden claws and a bright future. How could she humiliate him like this?

She was too much\!

Dora muttered in her heart and pretended not to see it. She immediately turned around and left, continuing to return to the hole to lie down and sleep.

Her daughter was domineering\!

At such a young age, she could already ride a golden-haired lion cub under her crotch. It was really true that the waves at the back pushed the waves at the front. Every wave was stronger than the previous\!

"Roar —"

This girl was roaring comfortably again.

In the cave, her precious daughter was riding on the golden-haired little lion king's. As she slapped his butt, she reprimanded softly.
