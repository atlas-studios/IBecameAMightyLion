Chapter 171: Golden Claw Rebirth (1)

Something unexpected happened\!

When Chu Xiaoye was biting the rabbit and preparing to find a place to eat, the miserable and terrified cries of the jackal couple suddenly came from the camp\!

His heart jumped. He hurriedly abandoned the rabbit and rushed back.

An unfamiliar and dangerous aura followed the night wind and assaulted him.

The jackals' miserable cries stopped\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and ran back at his fastest speed.

In the camp, a group of female lions were surrounding the jackal couple and biting them.

The jackal couple, who had been crying out miserably just now, were already torn to pieces and died miserably\!

Lions generally would not eat the corpses of jackals, but now, this group of female lions had cruelly torn them up and devoured them. Clearly, it was not for their appetite, but to take revenge and vent their anger\!

The anger in Chu Xiaoye's chest jumped up with a bang\!

He bared his fangs and charged forward angrily\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a strong lion suddenly jumped out from the grass on the right. Its huge claws slapped viciously at his head\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly jumped to the left\!

Just as he landed, another figure suddenly jumped down from the tree above him. It pushed him to the ground and bit his neck\!

This was an agile lioness\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly kicked its abdomen and raised its lower back up\!

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to immediately roll out from under it\!

Just as he got up from the ground, another strong male lion with a black mane suddenly jumped out from the grass on the left. Without a sound, it pounced at him ferociously\!

Even so, he still rushed towards the female lions that were biting and devouring the corpses of the jackals at his fastest speed\!

"Whoosh\!"

He was as fast as a meteor\!

Before the few female lions with their mouths full of blood could react, he had already jumped up and rushed in front of them\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

There were a few muffled sounds\!

Chu Xiaoye's slap was filled with anger. He slapped them hard in the mouth with the fastest and most strength\!

The mouths of the female lions immediately broke and blood sprayed. They fell to the ground and cried out miserably\!

"Bang\!"

An explosion\!

Chu Xiaoye slapped the lioness that was biting the flesh of the jackal again. Her skull exploded and blood splattered everywhere\!

At this moment, the two lions and the female lion chasing behind him suddenly stopped and looked at him coldly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the corpses of the jackal couple on the ground, turned around, and looked at them too.

A terrifying aura suddenly filled the air from behind.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked behind him.

A super lion that was almost twice the size of the previous black-haired lion slowly walked out of the forest.

His eyes were blue and he had a thick burgundy mane that extended from his neck to his entire body. When he walked, the muscles on his shoulders bulged\!

His eyes were cold and his face was dignified. Even if he did not roar, his entire body was still filled with an extremely fierce and terrifying aura\!

Behind him, five extremely large and strong lions were lined up\!

Behind those lions was a large group of female lions, and there were at least twenty of them\!

At this moment, they spread out silently and blocked every path in the surroundings.

This was an extremely powerful pride\!

And this blue-eyed lion that was emitting a dangerous aura was their lion king\!

He was the true owner of this territory\!

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye saw that behind this blue-eyed lion, there was the corpse of a young cub in the mouth of a lion\!

It was Doya's corpse\!

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled and the strange heat in his abdomen instantly flowed throughout his body\!

His feet were extremely hot\!

Fury burned in his chest\!

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly turned around and rushed towards the lion\!

The blood in his entire body flowed quickly, and with burning anger, it flowed towards every organ and meridian in his body\!

He was even faster\!

Just as he jumped up and was about to fly over the head of the blue-eyed lion king, the blue-eyed lion king suddenly raised its upper body and its huge and heavy claws slapped at him with a bang\!

A strong wind assaulted him\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his claws and welcomed it fiercely\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The blue-eyed lion king stood in place without moving.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he suddenly felt an intense pain coming from his right claw. At the same time, a huge force sent him flying\!

He fell heavily to the ground and jumped up.

His right claw was burning with pain, trembling and a little numb.

He almost could not stand steadily\!

How terrifying was the strength of this blue-eyed lion king\!

He stood in place, his heart filled with shock.

For some reason, the other lions and female lions did not take this opportunity to attack.

The blue-eyed lion king raised the claw that had just slapped him and looked at him indifferently. It looked at him again, seemingly surprised.

The other lions surrounded them and were silent.

The blue-eyed lion king took a step forward and grinned at Chu Xiaoye. It turned around and looked at the five strong lions behind it, then at the grassland outside.

Then, he looked at him with a dignified expression.

Chu Xiaoye immediately understood what he meant.

He seemed to be saying, "Kid, join our pride and become my subordinate like them. I can spare your life\! Furthermore, I can give you this territory\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked behind him at the lion that was biting Doya's corpse.

The blue-eyed lion king narrowed its eyes and turned around to look at the lion. It suddenly turned around and walked over, biting Doya's head\!

"Crack\!"

He actually bit Doya's head off, chewed a few times, and swallowed it.

His dignified and terrifying gaze looked at Chu Xiaoye again. Fresh blood flowed from the corner of his cracked mouth, and he seemed to be threatening, "Perhaps, you want to become this king's delicious meal like this little thing\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not answer and pounced over\!

His eyes were red and the blood in his body seemed to be burning as it surged\!

He suddenly jumped up, raised his still trembling but extremely hot right palm, and slapped hard at the blue-eyed lion king\!

A look of disdain appeared in the blue-eyed lion king's eyes. It still stood in place without moving. It raised its body and swung its claws calmly.

"Bang\!"

This time, his entire body suddenly trembled. His claws were numb and he almost lost his balance\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, he was sent flying again and fell miserably into the grass.

However, he jumped up again.

The pain in his right palm quickly disappeared under the impact of the strange heat in his body.

His entire body was still filled with hot energy\!

The blue-eyed lion king looked at him in shock and disbelief.

When Chu Xiaoye pounced ferociously again, he suddenly roared and jumped up. His right palm swung out with a whoosh\!

"Bang\!"

This time, the blue-eyed lion king landed on the ground. Its right palm turned limp and it almost fell.

A burning pain appeared on his right palm for the first time in so many years\!

As for the foreign little lion, it was not sent flying by him this time. Instead, it landed steadily on the ground, and its right palm was intact\!

The shock in the blue-eyed lion king's eyes grew stronger.

His expression suddenly turned dark, and his eyes flickered with fear.

If he allowed this son to grow up, he would be the greatest threat to his throne in the future\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and gave the surrounding lions an order.

"Kill this kid\!"

The surrounding lions, be it male or female, roared angrily and pounced forward\!

There was no rule of a lion fighting and a lioness not caring here.

Here, there were only the king's orders\!

All the members of the territory had to obey the king's orders unconditionally. Otherwise, they would be expelled at best and executed at worst\!

Chu Xiaoye did not know how their lion king position was created.

If they mobilized in groups for every battle, which wandering lion would have a chance?

The age of the blue-eyed lion king in front of him could not be determined, but his strength and power were definitely not something that a lion in this pride could compare to.

How did he once occupy this territory and dominate it?

Chu Xiaoye was filled with doubts, but now was not the time to think about these things.

The jackal couple died tragically and Doya was killed. This happened a few days after he established the territory.

He had to take revenge\!

This blue-eyed lion king clearly sensed his threat and had to let him die.

Looking at the lions pouncing ferociously around him, Chu Xiaoye knew that now was not the time to show off.

Only by preserving his life could he continue to take revenge\!

He suddenly turned around and rushed towards the female lions behind him\!

The strength surging from his entire body made him faster and more ferocious\!

He was like a rapidly flying cannonball that rushed into the pride with a bang. He did not slap or jump, only sprinting at his fastest speed\!

"Bang\!"

The few ferocious female lions that pounced over were sent flying by him\!

Some had their heads broken, some had their necks broken, and some opened their mouths to bite him. However, their mouths were suddenly broken and they flew out\!

He was like a crazy rhinoceros, charging forward and opening a path, escaping into the depths of the bushes\!

"Roar—"

The blue-eyed lion did not look at the injured female lions. It immediately roared angrily and chased after them with the pride\!

This child could not be left alive\!

Chu Xiaoye's body became lighter and lighter as he ran. The two feet in front of him also became hotter and hotter\!

He felt that something was about to spew out from the gaps of his broken paws.

Under the bright moonlight, the golden fur on his neck seemed to have suddenly grown dozens of centimeters overnight. It was mixed in the brown fur and fluttered in the wind.
