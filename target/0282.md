Chapter 282: The Most Honorable Queen

After dawn.

Little Curly Tail returned with his face full of scratches.

That female cub was really despicable.

He was playing around with her and did not dare to really attack. However, the other party was extremely fierce. He either grabbed or bit her mercilessly.

If not for the fear of his brother reprimanding him, he would have long slapped the lioness cub's head flat\!

No wonder he played so well with Mei Mei. They were all lions of the same hill\!

They were all petty\!

When he lowered his head and climbed up the tree, Chu Xiaoye looked at him sternly and asked him what was wrong.

Little Curly Tail was a little guilty. He immediately looked wronged and hurriedly explained.

"Brother, I didn't bully Molly. I just wanted to play with her, but in the end, she scratched me like this. That female cub is even more fierce than Mei Mei\!"

Mei Mei lay on the tree and glared at him gloatingly.

At this moment.

Molly also lowered her head and walked back.

Mei Mei hurriedly climbed down from the tree and came to her side to ask what was going on.

She was afraid that her brother would blame this girl.

Molly looked up at Little Curly Tail with an angry expression, but she lowered her head again and did not say anything, as if she could not speak.

When Little Curly Tail saw this, he immediately raised his head and felt even more wronged.

"Brother, did you see that? The little lioness is guilty. She bullied me and deliberately scratched my handsome face with her claws. Brother, please allow me to go down and beat her up\!"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down and landed in front of him, slapping him on the face. He stared at him sternly and told him to tell the truth. How did he bully Molly last night?

Other than being bullied by him since he was young, this kid had never been bullied by anyone else\! He did not believe that Molly would dare to bully him. He must have bullied Molly first again\!

Little Curly Tail raised his claws and covered his head, feeling wronged and injured.

"Brother, I swear that I did not bully her at all. I just wanted her to get my permission before peeing in the future. After all, this is our territory. Brother had once taught Meimei and me that we could not pee anywhere."

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the head again.

Wasn't this bullying?

This kid was indeed destined to be alone for life and was even more stupid than a pig\!

Even the big pit knew to go out and seduce the female warthog\!

The opportunity was in front of him and he did not know how rare it was. He was simply trash\! He was too disappointed\!

Chu Xiaoye was angry at his silly appearance and could not be bothered with him anymore. He immediately climbed down the tree and prepared to go to the grassland to relax and think about the migration of the pride of the cold father.

Just as he jumped down from the tree, Tilly walked out of the forest beside him and ran in front of him. She pestered him again and let him bring her to drink water.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at her and told her to scram.

Tilly did not let up and blocked in front of him. She rubbed her head against his chin and neck in a fawning manner and even swayed her butt like a spoiled child.

"Please, I'm so thirsty. Just bring me there."

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye was distracted by her rubbing. He swung his claws and slapped her to the ground before leaving.

There must be something wrong with this female cub's head. If she wanted to drink water, she could go alone. Why did she have to pester him? He still had many things to do and did not have so much time to waste\!

The cold father lay in the grass not far away and shook his head, looking at him like he was a pig.

Even the warthog, Da Zhuang, looked at his retreating figure with a hint of shock and laughter.

Little Curly Tail stood on the tree and looked at his brother's cold and arrogant back. He looked at the little white lion gnashing its teeth under the tree and suddenly grinned.

"Brother is even more stupid than me sometimes. He actually doesn't know why such a beautiful lioness invited him to drink water. Hehehehe…"

The morning sun rose.

The grassland was golden.

Chu Xiaoye came to the border and looked at the distant grassland.

It was the direction of the home of the cold father's pride and the home of every pride here.

When could they really take back everything they had lost?

A familiar aura drifted over from behind.

On his shadow, a figure stood silently, looking at him quietly.

When he looked into the distance, she looked at him. When he turned around to look at her, she lowered her head and looked at the grass at her feet.

Under the golden sun, the little lioness's dark eyes were deep and charming.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He turned around, raised his claws, and rubbed her head, asking her a question curiously.

"Catherine, do you have dreams?"

Catherine lowered her head and felt the gentleness in his palm, her eyes filled with happiness.

"Of course I do. My dream is to follow by your side and look at you forever, even if I have to be your shadow forever…"

Catherine thought this in her heart but did not express it.

She shook her head to show that she did not.

Chu Xiaoye sighed, bent his claws, and flicked her ear.

It was actually quite good to have no dreams.

At least, she did not have so many worries.

At this moment, a group of strong gazelles walked over from the grassland not far away. They passed through the border and entered their territory.

Chu Xiaoye decided to let the members of the pride of the cold father eat their fill. Then, he would tell them to leave and move to the grassland on the other side of the mountain.

The other members were easy to talk to, but Mei Mei was not.

If that girl heard the news of him wanting her to leave, she would probably be very sad.

However, there was no choice. When their mothers moved to that side, they had to have a strong member protecting them and they had to be 100% loyal.

Little Curly Tail needed to stay and help him fight. Only Mei Mei was more suitable.

"Whoosh—"

Without needing his instructions, Catherine only looked at him and knew that he wanted to catch prey. Therefore, she immediately rushed towards the gazelles.

After mutating, these gazelles became tall, had strong limbs, and ran at an even more astonishing speed than before.

However, in front of Catherine, they could not escape\!

In the blink of an eye, the two gazelles fell to the ground.

When Catherine chased after the third gazelle, a gazelle suddenly rushed over from the side. It lowered its head and hit Catherine.

Catherine nimbly dodged and slapped the gazelle's head.

The gazelle's front legs turned limp and it knelt on the ground. Then, blood flowed from its mouth and nose as it fell.

Catherine did not look at it and chased after the fourth gazelle again.

Looking at her heroic and agile figure, Chu Xiaoye could not help but think of his promise to her in the past to make her the most honorable queen on this grassland.

This female cub did have the potential.   

Of course, the prerequisite was that he became the king first.

In another territory in the distance, the roars of lions united against a common enemy sounded. 

Lars was standing in front of the pride, encouraging them with an impassioned declaration.
