Chapter 66: Enemies

"Roar—"

The lion, the cold father, seemed to be a little embarrassed and angry. He roared and pounced at the giraffe again\!

He pounced at the giraffe's butt\!

In the end, just as he pounced on it, before he could grab hold of it tightly, the giraffe's butt suddenly rose up. At the same time, its two strong hind legs were raised up and kicked backward fiercely\!

"Bam\!"

The cold father was sent flying and his mouth was kicked\!

He fell to the ground in a sorry state and struggled for a few times before getting up. His mouth was filled with blood and he seemed to be unable to stand steadily.

Seeing this scene not far away, Lars immediately crawled in the bushes in fright, not daring to move.

This prey was so terrifying\!

The five female lions did not stop and started to pounce from the side\!

They could not let the prey escape from the bushes\!

Furthermore, they could not let the prey escape into the territory of their neighbor, the Seno brothers' pride\!

Otherwise, all his previous efforts would be wasted\!

Aisha was the first to pounce on it and bit the lower end of the giraffe's neck. Her two sharp front claws grabbed its body tightly\!

No matter how hard it shook, she did not relax.

Xi'er also pounced bravely from the other side and bit the side of the giraffe's abdomen. Her entire body swayed as she hung there.

The lioness with a broken tail roared angrily. Before the giraffe could raise its hind legs, she pounced on it and bit the root of its hind leg, hugging its thigh tightly with her entire body\!

The three female lions were all hanging on the giraffe\!

However, the giraffe was still strong. In its fear, it suddenly ran like crazy\!

Even if there were thorns in front of it, it still charged over without care\!

The three female lions that were hanging on it and swaying immediately could not hold on anymore. They were shaken off by the strong shaking and fell miserably into the grass.

The pregnant Callie and Maya did not dare to approach.

The five female lions opened their mouths tiredly and stopped in their tracks. They could only watch helplessly as their prey ran away.

They panted heavily with dejected expressions.

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, the giraffe, which had just run a few meters away, suddenly staggered and fell to the ground\!

Because it ran too quickly, after its huge body fell, it even rolled a few times on the ground.

It seemed to have been stunned by the fall and lay on the ground motionless.

The five female lions were stunned for a moment. Then, with a whoosh, they suddenly rushed over\!

At this moment.

The giraffe, who was lying on the ground, struggled in panic and wanted to get up.

However, it was extremely difficult.

Aisha and Xi'er pounced ferociously and bit its long neck\!

The other three female lions also rushed up and bit its front and back legs, preventing it from standing up\!

The lion, the cold father, rushed over and jumped onto the giraffe's back. He used his heavy body to press it down and bit its spine\!

His mouth was split open from the kick and he felt a burning pain. This angered him even more\!

His sharp teeth pierced fiercely into the giraffe's skin and bit its bones\!

The pride worked together and pressed this powerful creature into the grass\!

However.

The giraffe did not give up. It was still struggling\!

It twisted its neck and flailed its limbs with all its might, flipping its body with all its might, resisting tenaciously and determinedly\!

Aisha suddenly let go of its neck and ran towards its head. She bit its mouth and wrapped its mouth and nose in it\!

When female lions hunted large prey, they would usually use this method to block the prey's mouth and nose, making it unable to breathe and suffocate to death.

Although the giraffe was tall and strong, its head was very small and fragile.

The giraffe widened its eyes in fear and despair, shaking its head vigorously.

However, it was useless.

Soon, it could not breathe.

Aisha bit hard and pierced her two sharp claws into its head\!

Not long after.

It stopped struggling and quietened down.

However, the pride did not relax their vigilance and continued to do their own thing, biting every part of its body.

On the tree.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch and quietly watched this scene.

The green vine on the ground had already broken.

It was like a rope. The moment the giraffe ran over, it suddenly rose from the ground and tripped the front leg of the giraffe.

The giraffe raised its front legs and immediately tightened the loose green vines\!

The moment the green vine broke, this tall prey fell to the ground with a bang.

Chu Xiaoye pulled up and let go at the right time.

But.

This hunting method made him feel inexplicably guilty.

"I'm a lion."

He reminded himself this way. Then, he climbed down the tree and prepared to enjoy a feast.

On the big tree opposite.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei looked at him in a daze. They were stunned by his method of tripping their prey and could not react for a long time.

They had completely refreshed their understanding of hunting methods.

It turned out that they could hunt like this\!

His brother was indeed his brother. He was always so strong and smart\! Even if they tried to flatter him, they would not be able to catch up to him\!

The two little fellows climbed down the tree and walked in front of the broken green vine, looking at it curiously and in amazement.

Lars quickly ran out of the bushes and ran towards the fallen prey excitedly.

He could finally eat his fill\!

The giraffe had already stopped breathing and was lying on the ground motionless.

The cold father and the five female lions had already opened their mouths, but they did not eat immediately. Instead, they opened their mouths and panted heavily.

They were tired and hot.

They needed to rest for a while.

Lars ran in front of the giraffe, drooled, and started biting at its abdomen.

"Roar—"

The cold father, who was lying on the giraffe's back, suddenly roared angrily. He jumped up and slapped him hard on the face\!

Then, it opened its bloody mouth and bit at him\!

It was time to teach this unrestrained and lawless kid a lesson\!

Lars was frightened and hurriedly jumped up to escape. His face was covered in blood, fear, and resentment.

He ran towards his mother, hoping that the lionesses could help him.

However, his mother, the lioness with a broken tail, was lying on the ground, panting with her mouth open. She had no intention of helping him and her gaze at him was filled with coldness.

He asked for it\!

Lars could only run towards the distant bushes in fear\!

However, just as he ran for a distance, he suddenly saw two cold and cunning hyenas standing behind a bush in front of him\!

In the distance, the grass swayed.

More hyenas quietly came.

Their eyes were not only filled with greed and desire, they were also filled with sinister hatred\!

They had a new queen.

Furthermore, there were new companions joining in. The number had already reached more than forty\!

Other than more than ten hyenas guarding the cubs at home, the remaining thirty plus hyenas were all mobilized\!

The prey that was already dead on the ground and the pride lying beside the prey all attracted them.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

They finally stopped hiding and cried out excitedly and arrogantly.

They had the numbers and strength\!

They waited for the enemy to tire\!
