Chapter 413: Untitled

"Bang\!"

However, before Belia could flare up, Chu Xiaoye was already furious. He slapped her out.

The little girl was too fragile and did not dare to attack, afraid that she would be slapped to death.

As for this little leopard, there was no need to worry. Its skin was thick and its flesh was rough. It could fight if it wanted and could not be killed no matter what. It was definitely a good tool to vent its anger.

"Get lost too\!"

Chu Xiaoye glared at the little girl beside him and revealed a fierce expression.

This little girl actually treated him as a person draped in lion skin and was preparing to peel off his skin. Damn it\!

The little girl was not afraid of him. She stuck out her tongue and immediately tilted her body. She lay obediently beside him and closed her eyes. She hugged her neck and pretended to sleep, but she was still whispering, "King, don't worry. I won't tell them. Only Annie knows that you're actually a person wearing lion skin."

Ha, this little girl was really arrogant.

"Hehe, no wonder the king doesn't like those female lions and only likes Annie."

The little girl muttered happily again.

Tsk tsk, this little girl actually learned to be shamelessly narcissistic\!

Chu Xiaoye felt that he had to let her know the dignity of a lion\!

"Roar—"

He growled and slapped the human little girl to the ground. Then, he bared his fangs and rode on her. He pressed her throat with his claws and leaned close to her with a fierce expression.

If this little girl dared to be so impudent again, he did not mind eating her\!

The little girl lay on the ground with her brows furrowed. Her eyes were wide open, and they trembled as she looked at him. She seemed to be a little afraid and did not dare to say another word.

At this moment, the unwilling Belia crawled up from outside again and happened to see this unusual scene.

"Roar —"

The little female leopard immediately let out a sad cry and retreated. She staggered in front of her father and started to roar sadly.

Blue hurriedly rubbed her head and comforted her. "As a man, it's normal to have three or four wives."

Suddenly, he felt a chill behind him.

Blue looked back and two heads popped out from the bushes behind. It was Belita and her mother.

Blue hurriedly raised his claws and rubbed Belia's head, comforting her. "Lions are all perverted. How can they compare to us leopards?"

In the bushes, Chu Xiaoye let go of the little girl and crawled out. He realized that the rain had stopped.

The sky turned dark.

The sky was still dark and the temperature was still cold.

He originally thought that his scare just now would make the little girl stop for a while. Unexpectedly, the other party grabbed his tail again and said with tears in his eyes, "If you're fierce to me again, I'll really be angry."

"Bang\!"

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not scold her again. Instead, he raised his hind legs and kicked her to the ground.

He would never allow any member of the team to lose their respect for him. If that was the case, how could this lion king continue in the future?

Chu Xiaoye walked out of the bushes and jumped gently onto the tree, observing the surrounding forest.

The little girl lay in the bushes and sobbed silently.

Belia, who was feeling sad, seemed to have heard her cry. She immediately stood up from the ground and walked towards the bushes.

When she saw that the human girl was really crying inside, the sadness in Belia's heart immediately disappeared and turned to joy.

"You deserve it\! Only the beautiful and sexy Belia is worthy of such a powerful king\!"

Belia grinned in disdain and looked up at Chu Xiaoye on the tree.

Her father was right. It was normal for lions to have multiple wives and concubines. In the future, more female lions would join the pride. If she was jealous, she would be jealous to death.

"Roar —"

She raised her neck and called out to the tree again, bravely expressing her love.

The members of the pride had long seen through her thoughts. At first, they were a little surprised, but they were already used to it. A king's charm should be so invincible.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and was a little annoyed. He swung his claws and cut off a branch, threw it down, and it landed on her head. He meant to tell her to stop messing around. If not, this king would beat you up again.

However, Belia pretended not to understand. She narrowed her eyes and let out a roar to show that she liked his gift. Then, she pressed the branch down and started to rub it.

"Damn\!"

Chu Xiaoye was completely defeated by this female leopard in heat.

He decided to go out and see if there were any prey.

Catherine got up from the grass and followed behind him silently.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at the female cub and sighed inwardly. How good would it be if the members of the pride were as quiet and obedient as Catherine?

Catherine walked for a distance and turned around to look at Belia, who was following behind. There was no hostility in her dark eyes and she looked calm.

For some reason, she was silently hoping that this female leopard could arouse some feelings in the king.

The true growth of a lion was not just its size and mane, but also its male instincts.

If the pride wanted to flourish, they naturally could not do without this instinct.

However, what made her anxious was that her king's body had grown and his mane had grown lush. However, he still disliked females like when they were young and even looked disgusted.

This was not a good sign.

Therefore, Catherine felt that it was time to let a female find a way to awaken the king's lion instincts.

Since this female leopard was so brazen, eager, and passionate, this might not be a bad thing.

Belia seemed to keenly sense that her hostility had disappeared. She immediately quickened her steps and chased after her. She walked beside her, tilted her head, and grinned at her, indicating that she was an adult who did not remember her mistakes. Her previous grievances were written off.

Catherine looked ahead and ignored her.

Just as Belia was about to continue getting close to her, Catherine suddenly jumped up with a whoosh and shot forward like an arrow\!

As Chu Xiaoye walked, he suddenly missed a step and fell\!

The leaves on the ground rustled as a deep pit suddenly appeared. The bottom of the pit was actually filled with sharp branches\!

It was a trap\!

The moment Chu Xiaoye fell, Catherine had already rushed over and hit him with a bang, sending him flying out of the pit\!

As for herself, she started to quickly fall towards the bottom of the pit.

Belia, who was following behind, was shocked and hurriedly ran over. For some reason, her heart suddenly trembled.

"Whoosh\!"

Before Catherine could fall into the pit, Chu Xiaoye had already extended his claws.

Catherine extended her claws.

Golden claws and silver claws were tightly clasped\!

This series of actions almost happened in a split second\!

When Belia rushed to the edge of the pit, Catherine had already used Chu Xiaoye's strength to fly up.
