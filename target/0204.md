Chapter 204: Lion King vs Lion King\!

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine finally jumped up from the snow and mimicked Chu Xiaoye. She landed on her back and rolled on the snow to move, quickly blocking the snow deer.

Her sharp claws pierced into the snow deer's stomach and she opened its stomach with a chi.

The snow deer struggled violently for a few times before its body stiffened and it died completely.

The blood spewed from her abdomen sprayed on Catherine's face.

Chu Xiaoye loosened his teeth and looked at the female cub. The corner of his mouth twitched. This female cub, the Ripper, really lived up to its name. She liked to open stomachs at any time.

Catherine licked the blood on her face. She was clearly hungry too.

However, she did not forget her identity. She lowered her head and retreated to the back.

Chu Xiaoye stuck out his head and smelled the two fruits growing on the snow deer's head. A strange fragrance immediately entered his nose.

He could not help but open his mouth and eat one.

It was sour and sweet in his mouth. The dense juice flowed with a strange fragrance, causing him to be shocked. A fragrance filled his mouth and flowed from his throat into his body.

It tasted very good.

He bit down on another one and turned his head to look at Catherine.

Catherine looked at him in a daze. Her heart immediately jumped and her breathing was rapid. Her body trembled as she walked forward. She lowered her eyes and slowly stuck out her mouth.

"Bam\!"

Just as the two heads were about to approach, Chu Xiaoye threw the fruit in his mouth to the ground, then turned around and bit the deer's neck.

He had to drag this big prey back to the forest by the road to enjoy.

The snow on the ground was too deep and it was difficult to even walk. If they encountered other ferocious beasts or another white bear, he and Catherine could only watch helplessly as their prey was snatched away.

He dragged the snow deer and walked in the snow step by step. He suddenly felt his entire body heat up and the coldness from before immediately disappeared.

After Catherine quickly ate the fruit, she came over and bit the snow deer's front leg to help drag it.

Soon, they returned to the snow forest where they had just encountered the white bear.

However, the white bear that had fainted on the ground was already gone.

There was a trail of blood on the snow. It must have been left behind by the white bear when he hit his head.

A row of huge footprints walked towards the distant forest.

Obviously, the white bear had already left when it woke up.

Chu Xiaoye placed the snow deer on the ground, lowered his head, and prepared to eat.

He was already famished.

Right at this moment, Catherine suddenly bared her fangs and let out a roar.

The scar-faced lion king brought the four lions and the five female lions and walked over on the snow, his eyes filled with desire.

Obviously, they had rested and were hungry.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and narrowed his eyes.

The scar-faced lion king's tall and strong body stopped two meters away. It looked at him coldly and then at the prey on the ground.

The pride behind him drooled and were impatient.

They had run for their lives and were already hungry. However, the snow in the nearby forest was too deep for them to hunt.

Coincidentally, there was a ready prey here.

"Roar—"

The lion and lionesses bared their fangs and let out threatening roars, as if they were saying, "Two little things, quickly scram\!"

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine stood beside the deer, still motionless.

"Whoosh\!"

The scar-faced lion king moved\!

He rushed over and jumped up. His two huge and heavy claws slapped fiercely at Chu Xiaoye, who was standing at the front\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his upper body and attacked with his right claw\!

The two claws collided and a muffled bang erupted\!

Chu Xiaoye's upper body landed on the ground and he stood in place without moving.

As for the scar-faced lion king, it landed on the ground and staggered, almost falling.

It was not that he was too weak, but the snow was too deep and his body was too heavy. As soon as his limbs landed, he fell deeply into it.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine stood in place without moving.

Because they knew that this was not like the grassland. Once you jumped and fell, you might never be able to get up again.

The two of them could not take such a risk.

As for the scar-faced lion king, it was different.

When he landed, the four lions and five female lions behind him had already rushed up and protected him.

This was the first time that both sides were fighting in this environment.

The thick snow under their feet greatly reduced their combat strength.

He could not use his strength, speed, or run.

The scar-faced lion king's limbs were almost drowned by the thick snow.

Although he was tall and had longer limbs, he was larger and heavier. He had just jumped down and fallen deeper.

At this moment, his right palm was slightly numb. His face was calm as he looked coldly at the young lion king in front of him. He was shocked.

This kid's strength was indeed extraordinary\!

No wonder his subordinates were very afraid of this kid.

It seemed that he could not snatch food and take revenge alone.

Fortunately, he had brought many members today.

This kid was so young and already had this strength. If he was allowed to continue growing, what would happen in the future?

The other party lived beside him. In the future, when he was full of wings and stronger, he would definitely be the first to attack him\!

Therefore, no matter what, he had to bury this kid in this snow forest today\!

"Roar—"

The scar-faced lion king immediately roared angrily and brought the pride over step by step.

Since he could not run or jump, he would surround and bite\!

No matter how agile these two little things were, they had nowhere to escape in the snow\!

Just as the scar-faced lion king walked close with the pride and was about to pounce on them and bite them, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine suddenly turned around and jumped onto the big tree beside them.

The scar-faced lion king was stunned. He brought his pride and surrounded the tree. He looked up at the tree and was immediately flustered.

The smell of blood from the snow deer on the ground stimulated the hungry stomachs of the pride and made them drool.

However, they had to wait for their king to enjoy it first.

"Roar—"

The scar-faced lion king roared angrily and let the pride continue to surround the tree. As for him, he turned around and walked in front of the snow deer. He raised his head and looked mockingly at the young lion king on the tree.

It seemed to be saying, "Kid, stay on the tree. As for your prey, let me help you enjoy it."

Just as he lowered his head and was about to enjoy the beautiful meal that he had snatched, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down from the tree with a whoosh. Like a goshawk that swooped down, he passed over the heads of the pride and pounced at him\!

The scar-faced lion king immediately roared angrily. It hurriedly raised its upper body and suddenly swung its huge and heavy claws\!

"Bang\!"

With a muffled sound, the two claws collided\!

Chu Xiaoye passed by him and twisted his body. He landed on his back and quickly rolled a few times on the ground. He immediately jumped onto another big tree\!

The scarred face lion king's body trembled and its upper body fell. It fell to the snow with a bang.

Scarlet blood surged out of his right palm and instantly dyed the white snow on the ground red.

Half of his entire right palm was cut off\!

"Roar—"

He let out a miserable roar and suddenly stood up again. He turned around and looked at the young lion king with flames shooting out of his eyes. His right leg was trembling slightly.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree trunk, raised his right claw, and slowly let go. A piece of flesh with sharp claws fell from his claw and landed on the snow with a bang.

It was the scar-faced lion king's right claw that had been cut off\!

The four lions and the five female lions stood beside the scar-faced lion king, their eyes filled with fear.

Their king had actually lost\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claws emitted a charming luster under the sun and snow, like a perfect work of art made of gold.

They had never seen such claws.

The scar-faced lion king stood in place, baring its fangs. Its eyes were filled with hatred, but it could not help but feel fear.

However, it was impossible for him to let go of this hatred and humiliation and turn around to leave\!

If he really left like this, he, the lion king, would have completely reached the end. In the future, no one would submit to him\!

"Whoosh\!"

Just as the attention of the pride was attracted by the terrifying young lion king in front of them, Catherine, who was on another tree behind them, suddenly jumped down and pounced on the female lion at the back. With a "chi", she opened her stomach\!

Before the female lion could fall to the ground, she immediately stepped on the female lion's body and jumped back to the tree\!

At this moment, the other members of the pride woke up.

When they turned around, the female lion's eyes widened and she fell to the ground. Blood flowed from her abdomen and her internal organs were scattered all over the ground\!

Catherine the Ripper did not let the matter rest.

When the lions were still in a daze, she pounced over again at an extremely fast speed and cut open the abdomen of another female lion. Then, she mimicked Chu Xiaoye and landed on her back. She rolled on the ground quickly a few times and stood up.

She did not climb up the tree immediately. Instead, she raised her sharp claws full of blood and looked at the pride coldly and provocatively.

Another lioness was cut open and fell.

The female lion did not die immediately. Instead, she lay on the ground and twitched as she widened her eyes and opened her mouth, letting out a terrified and desperate whimper.

The remaining three female lions immediately trembled in fear and hurriedly hid behind the lion.

"Roar—"

The four lions immediately roared angrily, bared their fangs, and pounced at Catherine\!

However, because the snow on the ground was too deep, they ran very slowly. They were not worthy of their fluttering manes and mighty and domineering auras.

A lion fell to the ground and could not get up for a long time.

Catherine stood in place, seemingly not preparing to escape.

When the three lions bared their fangs and ran in front of her with difficulty, preparing to pounce on her and bite her, Catherine suddenly raised her claws. With a whoosh, snow flew up and landed on the faces of the three lions\!

Then, a figure pounced over and suddenly grabbed the face of a lion\!

Before the lion could react, Catherine rolled out of the ground and quickly rolled under the tree to climb up.

"Roar—"

The lion's miserable scream immediately sounded in the forest\!

At this moment, the two lions at the side realized that half of this companion's face was actually grabbed\!

The other side of his face was long gone\!

It turned out that this lion was the lion that was disfigured by Catherine previously\!

He did not expect to scratch the remaining half of his face off again\!

It cried out miserably as it rolled crazily on the ground. Blood soon dyed the snow red. Its ferocious and terrifying face revealed dense white bones, looking extremely miserable.

The other two lions and the remaining three female lions were terrified and retreated together.

At this moment.

The scar-faced lion king was standing under the tree, looking up at Chu Xiaoye on the tree. It let out a roar of hatred and anger, as if it was asking him to come down and fight to the death\!

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and looked at him calmly.

The scar-faced lion king's right leg was trembling and blood was flowing non-stop from its broken claw.

He could only raise his right leg and not dare to step on the cold snow. Therefore, he felt extremely uncomfortable standing there.

He wanted to end the battle quickly\!

As for Chu Xiaoye, he hid on the tree and did not come down to fight him.

Therefore, he could only raise his head, bare his fangs, and roar angrily. He did not seem to have seen what was happening behind him.

He was furious\!

He was like an angry disabled person who had been cursing the other party with a fierce aura. He wanted the other party to take the initiative to fight him in close combat, but the other party ignored him.

As for him, he could do nothing to the other party.

What made him even more furious and desperate was that his right leg was injured and he could not move freely. He could not escape even if he wanted to.

Once he aimed his back at this despicable and shameless kid, with the other party's speed and his current slow reaction, he would be unable to resist the other party's sneak attack and kill.

Therefore, at this moment, he was already riding a tiger and could not get down. He could only continue to curse under the tree, hoping to anger this young kid and make him come down to fight quickly.

Weren't young people all hot-blooded?

Kid, this King is cursing you. Come down quickly\!

"Coward\! Little bastard\! Country bumpkin\! Young Fool\! You only know how to hide on the tree and tremble. If you have the ability, come down and fight\! What lion are you? You're not even a mouse\!"

The scar-faced lion king roared as it trembled.

He stood on three legs, one of which was still in unbearable pain and could not hold on much longer.

However, that despicable and shameless kid was still lying on the tree and looking at him calmly, as if he was not angered at all.

The scar-faced lion king trembled in anger. He suddenly roared angrily and ordered his remaining companions to come over. They raised their heads and roared, cursing together\!

He did not believe that he could not scold this despicable and shameless little thing\!

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

Hence, roars immediately sounded one after another in the snow forest.

Even the snow on the tree was shaken by their powerful roars.

Under the lead of the lion king, a group of lions surrounded the tree. They raised their necks and opened their mouths, roaring endlessly, sometimes high and sometimes low. It was a rhythm.

Catherine lay on another tree and watched this scene with a stiff expression. The cold killing intent in her eyes also turned to shock and strangeness, as if she was looking at a group of idiots.

This group of lions…

Was he stupid from anger?

On the big tree, Chu Xiaoye was still lying there calmly with his head lowered, watching their ferocious expressions with enjoyment.

When the male leopard, who had just returned from eating, heard this terrifying roar, its heart jumped. It thought that something big had happened.

However, when he ran over and saw this extraordinary scene, he was stunned in place.

Was this group of lions admitting defeat and performing for the young lion king to show their appreciation?

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

"Roar—Roar —"

In the end, the female lions finally could not hold on anymore and let out hoarse roars continuously.

As for their scar-faced lion king, it was exhausted from roaring and its mouth was dry.

Hence, under the lead of the lion king, they finally stopped roaring. Then, they lowered their heads and licked the snow on the ground, greedily moistening their throats.

The male leopard not far away:"…"

After moisturizing his throat, the furious scar-faced lion king also woke up.

This was not a solution.

He raised his head and looked angrily at the kid on the tree. His heart skipped a beat. Then, he lowered his head and looked at his companion beside him. Then, he immediately limped and prepared to leave.

He planned to use himself as bait to lure that despicable kid down.

If the other party did not fall for it, that was even better. He could leave with the pride\!

He was pleased that he could think of this plan.

"Roar—"

He pretended to roar angrily and immediately left with the pride.

The three lions and the three female lions behind him immediately became highly nervous and prepared to turn around and bite at any time.

As for the disfigured lion, it was still crying out miserably on the ground.

They gave up on him.

Catherine suddenly jumped down from the tree and walked over silently. She raised her sharp claws and suddenly cut open the lion's abdomen\!

"Roar—"

The lion immediately let out a scream and opened its mouth to bite her. Its face was covered in blood and it was terrifying\!

Catherine had already jumped away and chased after the scar-faced lion king that was about to leave.

She could not let this pride leave. She had to eliminate the roots here\!

Otherwise, when they reached the true snow mountain, if the other party still had other companions and gathered to take revenge, her king would be in danger.

"Roar—"

She suddenly bared her fangs and roared at the lions, telling them to stop\!

The scar-faced lion king trembled in fright and turned its head. It was secretly happy. Little thing, are you finally willing to come down from the tree?

The pride following behind him immediately bared their fangs and prepared to fight.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine suddenly jumped onto a big tree beside her and quickly climbed onto a branch that was horizontally above. Then, like a monkey, she started to jump forward from the tree.

Although the trees here were not very dense, her jumping was very powerful. In a few leaps, she caught up to the scar-faced lions.

The scar-faced lion king was shocked and did not dare to stay any longer. He hurriedly roared angrily and called for the pride to protect him as he left.

However, just as he limped a few steps, he suddenly sensed that something was wrong. He looked up and was so frightened that he almost fell\!

On the snow four to five meters in front of him, the young lion king that he hated to the bone was already standing there at some point in time\!

A cold wind blew.

That golden fur did not fit in this snow-white world, but it was exceptionally dazzling.

Chu Xiaoye stood in the snow, his sharp golden claws piercing into the cold snow. His entire body was hot and his blood was flowing.

For some reason.

He really wanted to fight\!
