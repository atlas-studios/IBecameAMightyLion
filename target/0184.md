Chapter 184: Catherine's Claws\!

The night retreated.

A trace of light appeared in the distant sky.

Corpses covered the ground.

A new territory and throne needed to be dyed in blood to be consolidated.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the bushes and lay in the grass.

Catherine stood silently beside him and protected him.

The Chino brothers hid in the distance, afraid that this lioness cub, who had been abused by their boss, would suddenly be angry and vent her anger on them.

The cute violent bear and her son came over slowly. They looked at Catherine and then at Chu Xiaoye. They suddenly realized that this little lion was a little familiar and that they seemed to have seen it before.

However, they did not think much of it and immediately wandered excitedly in the bushes.

In the bushes, not only were there many fruit trees, there were also many fresh branches and roots, as well as all sorts of insects and small animals. They could all become their food.

Furthermore, not far from the bushes, there was a wide river.

They could catch fish often.

Therefore, they were very satisfied with this new territory.

At least here, there was no threat from the wolf pack. Furthermore, there was the protection of the extremely powerful lioness cub.

The morning sun soon rose.

The grassland filled with the smell of blood emitted an even more beautiful luster under the golden sun.

Cruel survival battles happened almost every day, be it on the other side of the mountain or here.

Eliminating the weak would make the living more tenacious.

Catherine turned around and secretly looked at the king beside her.

On his neck was a golden fur that was more beautiful than the sun. It was like a flame that was burning in her eyes and in her heart.

Was he finally going to grow up?

His body, aura, and dignity were growing healthily.

He had his own territory, his subordinates, and his throne.

She was happy for him.

However, as a lion king, he seemed to be lacking something important.

What was it?

Her eyes flickered as she turned around and looked at the distant grassland.

The sun was bright and the grassland was beautiful.

The temperature here was suitable and it was like spring all year round.

Spring had arrived, and all things…

"Bang\!"

Just as she was letting her imagination run wild in her drunken state, Chu Xiaoye slapped her head and looked at her seriously with a questioning look.

"Why are you here? Where's Little Curly Tail and the others? Where's my family?"

Catherine knew that his family would always be the most important to him.

However, this made her admire him even more.

He was much more loyal than those heartless baddies\!

"Roar…"

She lowered her head and called out softly, like a child who had done something wrong. She did not dare to look at him, but she was begging in her heart: Can I… Can I be your family?

Every animal had their own way of communicating.

Although Chu Xiaoye could not hear what she was saying, he knew that Little Curly Tail and the others were safe. She had come here secretly because of herself.

Thinking of the hardships and dangers along the way, Chu Xiaoye admired the lioness cub's ability and perseverance even more.

After careful observation, the female cub became taller and larger. Her figure also became more slender and stylish. Clearly, she had suffered a lot along the way and grown a lot.

However, Chu Xiaoye was a little worried.

She came over. There was only Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei there. Could they take good care of his mother and the others?

Of course, his mother, the cold father, and the others all had their own survival skills and had survived many dry seasons safely. He believed that they could survive very well if they were still in the past.

However, things were different now.

Be it the grassland here or the grassland on the other side, something terrifying seemed to have happened.

Many animals were not original animals.

He only hoped that they could keep a low profile, stop provoking strong enemies and wait for him to return safely.

When he recovered, he would visit his neighbors.

At least, he had to make them acknowledge his sovereignty over this territory.

With the help of this female cub, things would clearly progress much faster.

"Coo…"

At this moment, a hungry sound suddenly came from his stomach.

The battle last night and his evolution had exhausted all the flesh he had just replenished.

As his body grew and his claws evolved, he would need to eat more and more food every meal in the future.

Fortunately, there was plenty of food and resources here, and he did not have to worry about being hungry and malnourished.

Catherine immediately stood up and ran out.

When Chu Xiaoye wanted to stop her, the little lioness was already like a whirlwind in the morning and had already run far away.

The battle last night filled the grass in the territory ahead with the corpses and smells of hyenas. Before these things were cleaned, few herbivores would come in to hunt.

If he wanted to hunt now, he had to go to the grass in another direction or the grass near the river.

However, the female cub clearly did not realize this. She actually ran straight towards the grass full of hyenas' corpses. She would have made a wasted trip.

As Catherine ran, she searched the surrounding grassland, ignoring the hyena corpses on the grass.

Soon, she discovered a group of zebras on the grassland in front of her.

Her eyes lit up and she ran over.

However, she did not know that she had already crossed the border of the territory and broken into the territory of the pride next door.

When she bathed in the morning sun and ran towards the zebra herd at lightning speed, a furious roar suddenly came from the bushes not far away\!

First, a female lion appeared. Then, more female lions appeared.

The twelve female lions did not hesitate and immediately roared as they charged towards the daring female cub that had trespassed their territory. They blocked her path towards the zebra herd\!

This was their territory\!

And these zebras were naturally their prey\!

No other lions could barge into their territory and hunt their prey\!

Catherine's path was blocked and she slowed down, but she did not stop. She still ran towards the twelve female lions.

The twelve female lions were tall, healthy, and strong, and filled with explosive force.

Every lioness was larger than her.

After all, she was only one year old and had different genes. She was smaller than them.

The two sides seemed to be on completely different levels.

The twelve female lions clearly did not care about her. Only two female lions rushed out and decided to teach her a deep and unforgettable lesson.

However, Catherine did not even look at them. Just as they were about to approach her, she suddenly accelerated and sent the two strong female lions flying with a bang\!

The two female lions were caught off guard. They did not expect her to suddenly increase her speed and actually dare to hit them with her head\!

Therefore, before they could react, they flew out and fell heavily to the ground\!

At that moment, they were dizzy and their vision turned black. They could not stand up.

The ten female lions behind were shocked when they saw this scene. They hurriedly roared angrily and rushed up together\!

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine was not afraid at all and continued to charge over. Like a sharp sword that was flying quickly, she pierced through the middle of the female lions and flew out again\!

The three female lions were knocked to the ground.

The other two female lions' faces were badly mutilated by the sharp claws\!

Before they could react, the figure rushed past them and appeared behind them.

The two disfigured female lions immediately let out miserable cries and flew into a rage. They suddenly turned around and pounced forward, baring their fangs to take revenge\!

The zebras not far away also fled in all directions because of their roars.

Catherine suddenly stopped and turned around, looking at them coldly.

The hearts of the two female lions immediately turned cold, but they had no choice but to bite the bullet and roar as they rushed up\!

Their companions were watching. How could they be frightened by a female cub that smelled like milk\!

"Roar—"

Their roars were filled with anger and hatred\!

Their faces were covered in blood and they looked ferocious. They wanted to tear this lioness cub into pieces\!

They pounced ferociously\!

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine did not retreat or dodge. Instead, she rushed towards them, her dark eyes flickering with a fierce cold light\!

Other than him, no one could dream of brandishing their claws at her\!

Unless they were already tired of living\!

"Bang\! Bang\!"

The two female lions full of anger and hatred had just rushed close and had yet to pounce on her when they were sent flying by her two slaps\!

Before they could land, Catherine had already rushed up. A cold glint flashed in her claws and she actually opened the stomachs of the two female lions with a "chi"\!

Ruthless, cruel, and merciless\!

Her cold gaze was terrifyingly cold and fierce\!

Immediately, blood sprayed and internal organs splashed\!

The two female lions fell to the ground with a bang. Their eyes were wide open and their bodies twitched. They struggled with all their might and died on the spot\!

The grass under them was instantly dyed red with blood and their internal organs flowed all over the ground.

The other female lions that were about to pounce over immediately stopped in their tracks when they saw this terrifying scene. They were terrified and their souls flew out\!

The grassland that was roaring continuously a moment ago immediately turned silent like a cicada in the winter.

All the female lions were shocked\!

No one had thought that this female cub was actually so powerful and ferocious\!

Catherine looked at them coldly, as if she had killed a few ants. Her expression was still cold and indifferent.

She turned around and continued to walk towards the fleeing zebras.

He was hungry.

She would kill whoever dared to stop her from hunting\!

If one came, she would kill one\!

If a pair came, she would kill a pair\!

If a group came, she would kill a group\!

Her claws were born for him\!

Her killing also existed for him\!

At this moment.

No lionesses dared to stop her again.

However, the lion's roar suddenly came from the distant grassland.

Clearly, their guards had come after hearing the news.

The three lions roared as they ran over majestically.
