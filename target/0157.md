Chapter 157: Don't Mess with Me\!

White lion?

Furthermore, it was a white lion with two rhinoceros bodyguards?

He had once seen this type of lion in records.

Many people said that this lion was suffering from albinism, which was why its fur turned white.

Actually, that was not the case.

According to research, this was a species that had existed since ancient times.

Most of them had once lived in places with snow.

However, under the influence of the worsening environment, they started to gradually migrate to the grassland.

However, their fur was incompatible with the color of the grassland and they could not disguise themselves well. Therefore, the number of them surviving decreased and they were on the verge of extinction.

Chu Xiaoye did not expect to see this breed here.

However, why was this white lion hanging out with the two rhinoceroses?

Furthermore, from the looks of it, the two rhinoceroses were like its bodyguards, helping it snatch food. Furthermore, they were standing at the side and watching.

Chu Xiaoye watched this scene in a daze, feeling a little unbelievable.

However, no matter how rare and noble its species was, what did it have to do with him?

If they dared to snatch his food, they could not blame him for being impolite\!

The little white lion lay on the ground and ate its prey in small bites, looking very refined.

However, the prey in front of it had a wrong origin and was snatched away\!

It was a thief\! A robber\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and walked over.

He wanted to teach this impudent thief a lesson\!

The little white lion finally raised its head and looked at him, but its eyes were filled with disdain and indifference. It continued to lower its head and eat.

They did not take him seriously at all\!

As for the two rhinoceroses, they flew into a rage. As if a certain baddie had disturbed their Missy's meal, they immediately rushed towards Chu Xiaoye like two small mountains\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he turned around and ran\!

The two rhinoceroses followed behind with a rumble, not preparing to let him go.

Soon, they disappeared into the bushes in front of them.

The little white lion continued to lie in place and eat slowly. It even yawned occasionally and looked lazy.

"Whoosh—"

Unexpectedly, right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye, who had just escaped from the front, suddenly jumped out of the forest behind and pounced on it, waving his claws at its head\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The consecutive slaps made her see stars. Her mind was blank and her head swayed like a rattle. Even the whites of her eyes rolled out.

"Little girl, you're courting death to fight me\!"

Chu Xiaoye got up from it, grabbed the black antelope in her mouth, and walked towards the depths of the bushes.

The little white lion lay on the ground, rolling its eyes and opening its mouth to drool. It was dumbfounded. After a while, it woke up.

At this moment, the two tired and panting rhinoceroses rushed back.

"Roar—"

The little white lion suddenly jumped up from the ground and shook its head vigorously. It realized that it was not dreaming. There was really a bastard riding on it and slapping it\!

"Kill him\!"

She immediately brought the two strong rhinoceros bodyguards into the depths of the bushes.

There was a trail of blood on the ground. Clearly, it was left behind by the bastard when he dragged the black antelope away.

The little white lion gritted its teeth and immediately walked forward along the blood trail.

She wanted to skin that bastard, pull out his tendons, bite him to pieces, and feed him to the dogs\!

The blood trail continued forward, winding through a patch of bushes.

The little white lion quickened its steps and quickly passed through the bushes.

Unexpectedly, just as she passed through the bushes, he suddenly lost his footing. With a splash, she fell into a waterhole full of mud\!

"Wu… Wu…"

She lowered her head and struggled in the waterhole in a panic, drinking a few mouthfuls of dirty water.

The two rhinoceroses hurriedly lowered their heads and pushed her out of the waterhole.

The little white lion climbed up in a sorry state. Its entire body was covered in mud and its snow-white fur was dirty. It was like a beautiful princess who had instantly become an ugly duckling.

"Roar—"

She roared angrily and was about to explode\!

She shook the mud on her body and continued to bring the two rhinoceroses forward.

She wanted to tear that bastard into pieces\!

The blood flowed forward and extended into the grass in front of him.

The grass was extremely lush and she could not see the path inside at all.

There was definitely a trap\!

The little white lion walked in front of the grass and stopped. It let the two rhinoceroses go first and she followed behind.

The huge bodies of the two rhinoceroses immediately pushed aside the grass and walked over calmly.

The little white lion heaved a sigh of relief. Just as it walked into the grass, it suddenly stepped on a pool of something thin and slippery. With a thud, it fell to the ground facefirst.

She raised her head in confusion and looked at the ground.

A large pile of slippery intestines and internal organs, as well as the feces in their intestines, were piled under her and in front of her.

At this moment, not only was her face and mouth covered in filth, but there was also a piece of intestines swaying…

"Ugh —"

She vomited.

"Roar—"

She roared for the third time\!

This time, she was really angry\!

She wanted to tear that bastard into pieces, grind his bones and scatter his ashes\!

As she vomited, she continued forward with the two rhinoceroses and endless anger, following the blood on the ground\!

Finally, after passing through a patch of bushes, she discovered that bastard\!

That bastard was actually still lying there, eating his prey in big mouthfuls, looking relaxed. He did not know how miserable and terrifying his future outcome was\!

"Roar—"

The little white lion suddenly roared angrily and charged over with hatred and anger\!

She wanted to tear this little rascal into pieces with her own mouth\!

She wanted him to know how miserable and desperate his outcome was to provoke and tease her\!

She wanted him to know…

"Bam\!"

However, just as she ran to a place only a meter away from him and was about to jump up and pounce on him, her body suddenly sank and she sank into the ground\!

Under her was a swamp full of mud\!

Because it had just rained a few days ago, its surface was covered in leaves. It did not look any different from the ground elsewhere.

At this moment, her limbs had already fallen into the mud. With a slight struggle, she fell even faster.

His anger suddenly turned into fear and panic\!

She stared blankly at the mud in front of her, looking terrified.

As for the two huge rhinoceroses, they stopped in front of the swamp pit. They wanted to go forward, but they did not dare to. They wanted to extend their necks to help, but they were not long enough. They immediately paced around the pit anxiously.

If they fell in, they would probably fall in instantly.

The little white lion's body started to sink slowly, and its four legs were already submerged.

Even if she did not move again, she was still walking slowly towards death.

She was so scared that her mouth was open and her eyes were wide. She was like a wooden stake, her entire body stiff and motionless.

As for the culprit, Chu Xiaoye, he was eating the fragrant black antelope in the grass a meter in front of her and did not even look at her.

Just like how she looked when she snatched his prey and ate it.

Chu Xiaoye's mouth was becoming pickier and pickier. He only ate the ribs and thigh meat. As for internal organs, butt heads of the black antelope and whatnot, he basically threw them away.

The little white lion's four legs were gone and its body started to fall.

Even though she raised her neck in fear, her mouth still started to touch the mud below.

She started to descend faster.

She had already lost all hope.

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, the corpse of the black antelope suddenly fell into the swamp\!

The black antelope's mouth was facing her face and landed a few centimeters in front of her mouth.

The other end of the black antelope was at the edge of the swamp. Chu Xiaoye was lying there, biting the hooves of the black antelope.

The little white lion was stunned for a moment. Just as its mouth was about to sink into the mud, it suddenly extended its neck and bit the black antelope's mouth\!

Chu Xiaoye bit the black antelope's hooves and suddenly used his strength to straighten its corpse\!

The black antelope's skeleton was still intact and there was still a lot of flesh left on its body, so its endurance was still okay.

The little white lion started to move forward slowly in the mud.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he bit the hooves of the black antelope and started to retreat.

"Bam\!"

Mud splattered everywhere\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly swung his head and pulled the little white lion out of the mud and dragged it ashore\!

Then, he let go of his teeth, stood up, and left quickly.

When the little white lion slowly woke up from its fear and turned to look at him, it only saw a blurry figure gradually disappearing into the boundless night.

It lay on the ground covered in mud, staring in that direction with its eyes wide open.

He looked at it for a long time, a long time…

Chu Xiaoye walked out of the bushes and returned the way he came.

He wondered if the Chino brothers had caught prey.

Doya was still hungry. If the Chino brothers did not bring back any prey, she could only continue to starve.

He did not have the time to hunt again, nor could he bring the prey back for her to eat from so far away.

If he wanted to return to the lake, he had to walk dozens of kilometers and pass through the territory of the three strong adult lions again.

He was full and rested. He was full of energy. It was time to recover the face he had lost previously\!

Although the three adult lions were huge and terrifyingly strong, their speed was not as fast as his.

He could go back and teach them a lesson.

They had just arrived at the grassland and were already given an opening gambit. If he did not get back at them, how could he survive on this grassland in the future?

And the female lions\!

They were looking down on him\!

He had to let them know how terrifying the future king of the grassland was\!

Not only did he have a terrifying fart, but he also had great strength\!

They could not provoke him\!

The familiar pungent smell assaulted his nose with the cool night wind.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this was the border of the pride.

He did not hesitate and directly crossed this border and walked into the territory.
