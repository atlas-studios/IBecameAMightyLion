Chapter 352: Untitled

"Ah —"

A sudden scream broke the silence of the night\!

The little girl's terrified scream sounded in the forest not far away. At the same time, the sound of her slapping something could be heard\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He did not hesitate and rushed over at lightning speed\!

In the forest not far away, a huge black gorilla was carrying the little girl and quickly jumping into the distance. It walked on the steep mountain path like walking on flat ground\!

Chu Xiaoye's gaze turned cold and he chased after her.

Just as Little Curly Tail and the others were about to follow, the roars of chimpanzees suddenly sounded from the surrounding forest. A large group of chimpanzees came with a murderous aura.

Chu Xiaoye immediately growled and let them guard here and protect the pride.

Only Catherine and Tilly did not listen to his orders and still followed behind him.

He could not order the little white lion.

As for Catherine, he knew very well that no matter where he went, she would follow. She was like his shadow that he could not shake off no matter how hard he tried.

"Pfft—"

A stream of air suddenly spewed out from behind him. His body jumped up and landed, instantly decreasing the distance between him and the black gorilla.

However, the black gorilla was very familiar with the terrain here. It turned left and right, running around in the forest. Although it was carrying the little girl, it walked as if it was flying and was extremely fast.

Every time Chu Xiaoye pounced behind it, it would suddenly jump up. Even if it went up the slope, it could still jump seven to eight meters away. It was like a Qinggong expert, light and agile.

At the same time, every time it landed, its feet would suddenly dig the ground and it would actually throw mud or rocks backward, blocking Chu Xiaoye's speed.

Soon, it rushed up the mountain, but it did not run down the mountain. Instead, it followed the undulating mountain range and ran horizontally towards an even higher peak in the distance.

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly fell from the sky\!

Chu Xiaoye's mane fluttered and his golden claws flickered with a cold light under the moonlight. He was like a meteor that cut through the night sky as he quickly fell and landed on the black gorilla's back\!

"Roar —"

The black gorilla immediately let out an angry roar. Its entire back was dripping with blood and a large piece of skin was torn off\!

However, it did not turn around or stop. It suddenly jumped up and continued to run with the little girl.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes revealed a hint of shock. The ferocity and endurance of this black gorilla and the strength it displayed along the way made him feel unbelievable.

"Whoosh—"

He did not hesitate and chased after her again.

This time, the black gorilla ran straight towards the mountain peak in front of it. It did not turn left or right, and there was no overly complicated terrain.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye easily caught up to it again. He swung his golden claw and slashed at its head\!

Right at this moment, the black gorilla suddenly raised the little girl in its hand above its head and blocked its head. It even turned around and cracked its mouth, laughing ferociously.

The muscles on Chu Xiaoye's face twitched and he immediately put away his claws. A stream of air spewed out from behind him. Just as he landed, he suddenly flew out and hit the badly mutilated back of the black gorilla heavily with a bang.

The black gorilla was caught off guard and fell to the ground, but it did not let go of the little girl in its hand.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to pounce on it and kill it, another strong chimpanzee suddenly jumped out from behind a rock beside him. It suddenly let out a roar and threw a punch at his head\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws and slapped it, but he felt a huge force attack him. He staggered and almost fell to the ground.

This black gorilla was surprisingly strong.

However, the other party clearly did not expect his conveniently swung claw to be so heavy.

The black gorilla that had suddenly attacked lost its balance and fell to the ground.

As for the black gorilla that was holding the little girl hostage, it immediately brought the little girl and continued running forward without reducing its speed\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

Before the sneak attacking gorilla could get up, Chu Xiaoye pounced forward and split its head open with his claws\!

"Roar —"

A scream cut through the night sky\!

Chu Xiaoye did not stop at all. His figure flashed and he chased after her.

The path ahead became steeper and wider, and there were huge rocks everywhere.

Soon, he chased after the black gorilla and arrived at the peak of the mountain where the cold wind was roaring.

There were few bushes and strange rocks. There were cliffs surrounded by clouds on both sides. He could not see the end at a glance. If he accidentally fell, he would be smashed into pieces no matter how thick his skin was\!

At this moment, the black gorilla suddenly stopped and turned around. It was panting and looking at him ferociously.

The little girl was held in its hand. Her golden hair fell and her face was pale. She swayed like a clean and exquisite little toy.

She seemed to know that struggling was just a waste of energy, so she had already quietened down. Her beautiful eyes were filled with fear. She held back her tears and looked pitifully at the young lion king that had chased close.

"Roar —"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to pounce on it, the black gorilla suddenly opened its mouth and roared, raising the little girl in its hand.

"Roar —"

"Roar —"

"Roar —"

From all directions, behind the huge rocks, they suddenly roared and stronger chimpanzees jumped out. There were more than twenty of them and they instantly surrounded him.

His roar was like thunder and his killing intent surged\!

These gorillas bared their fangs and their claws were like hooks. When they stood up, they were even taller and stronger than the mixed fur and blue eyes\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled as he flicked his golden claw.

Right at this moment, with a bang, a huge rock suddenly rolled out from behind the black gorilla that was holding the little girl. Then, a huge dark hole appeared.

At the same time, a strange cry came from inside\!

It sounded like the low growl of a beast or the strange laughter of a human, and it sounded rather terrifying.

At this moment, the twenty-plus black gorillas surrounding him suddenly bent down, lowered their heads, and lowered their eyes with a respectful and uneasy expression.

As for the black gorilla that was holding the little girl, it immediately turned around and knelt on the ground with the little girl in its hands. It lowered its head and slowly raised the little girl above its head, like a servant who was presenting gifts to the king\!

Boom\! The ground seemed to be trembling, as if some ancient beast was walking out of the huge cave\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. His muscles were tense as he stared intently at the dark hole.

At this moment, a huge image of a giant that could block bullets, attack planes with his bare hands, and step on tanks suddenly appeared in his mind\!

"Could it be this?"
