Chapter 435: Untitled

 Night fell.

This ancient and mysterious forest seemed even more deep and terrifying.

All around the forest, it seemed like black bloody mouths were open, waiting for prey to accidentally approach.

No one knew that a ferocious beast they had never seen before would suddenly jump out from the grass.

After Chu Xiaoye brought the pride away from the waterfall, he found an empty space halfway up the mountain and stopped, preparing to rest for two days. He would continue traveling after everyone's injuries were healed.

The beautiful grassland in the distance was very tempting to them now.

Every member definitely wanted to reach that land quickly.

However, they had to maintain enough vigilance and combat strength. Otherwise, what awaited them might be death.

The moon was very round and bright tonight.

Even in the dense and deep forest, they could still bathe in the bright and gentle moonlight.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not go out to hunt personally.

He let Blue Eyes bring the team out, and he, Little Curly Tail, and the others stayed in the camp to guard it in case the enemy attacked again.

The huge python hiding behind the water curtain seemed to have become a shadow in Chu Xiaoye's heart, making him constantly nervous and unable to relax.

If the other party had appeared at that time, it would have been fine. At most, he would have been defeated and fled. He would not have been so terrified and uneasy.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the tree and lowered his head, looking at the human little girl in the white dress with flickering eyes. He thought to himself, If the python suddenly rushed out from behind the water curtain and bit the little girl, what should he do?

Should he rush up and save her without care? Or should he immediately escape with the pride and abandon her completely?

Even he did not know.

To be honest, his feelings for this human girl were very complicated. He did not like or dislike her. He wanted to throw her away, but he could not bear to.

In the animal pack, every time he saw this human little girl, he would be touched by some emotions. Furthermore, he would have an extremely annoying sense of familiarity that always made him unable to be cruel.

It was really troublesome.

The little girl was holding her snow-white skirt and looking up at as she slowly circled under the moonlight. Her long eyelashes blinked gently and she muttered softly, as if she was recalling something.

The big black bear lay obediently at the side, widened its small eyes, and looked at her obsessively.

The little girl seemed to sense Chu Xiaoye's gaze and stopped spinning. She tilted her head and looked over. Seeing that Chu Xiaoye was looking down at her, she immediately smiled sweetly. Her bright eyes and white teeth were as dazzling as blooming flowers under the moonlight.

Chu Xiaoye retracted his gaze and looked elsewhere.

The little girl walked out from under the moonlight and came under the tree. She looked up at him and said softly, "King, Annie wronged you at the waterfall just now. I'm sorry."

Chu Xiaoye did not look at her. He looked up at the distant forest and pretended not to hear.

The little girl blinked and said sincerely, "In order to express Annie's apology, let Annie sleep with you tonight, okay?"

Ha\!

Chu Xiaoye still did not turn around, but he was sneering inwardly. You make it sound nice, but aren't you coveting my thick fur and wanting to treat me as a blanket? Scram\!

The little girl raised her head, her eyes bright and her face filled with anticipation. However, after waiting for a long time, he did not respond. She could only lower her head and say dejectedly, "Alright, Annie will go to sleep. King, good night. Thank you for saving Annie previously."

After saying that, she walked under the tree and sat down. She leaned against the tree and curled up there, closing his eyes.

The cold wind blew and she shivered and hugged her arms tightly.

The big black bear hurriedly tiptoed over and placed the leopard fur on her body to protect her from the wind and the cold. Then, it lay down beside her and its thick fur leaned on her.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at this scene and was even more curious and puzzled about the relationship and feelings of the man and bear.

Not long after.

Blue Eyes returned with the pride.

Strong prey were placed on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye growled and jumped down from the tree, calling for everyone to enjoy dinner.

The members of the pride were already hungry. When they saw the food, they immediately wolfed it down.

Chu Xiaoye enjoyed a big antelope alone. The meat in his mouth was even more fat and delicious than those prey in the past.

The little girl came uninvited and stood in front of him, looking at him pitifully, as if she was begging for his charity.

Chu Xiaoye ate until his mouth was full of blood. He extended his claws and patted the lamb ribs, ignoring her.

The little girl immediately became happy. She took out a knife from her waist and squatted beside him, starting to carefully cut the fresh lamb chop.

When Chu Xiaoye was chewing the meat, he turned around and glanced at her. He saw that she placed a piece of bloody mutton into her mouth without hesitation. She narrowed her eyes and chewed a few times before swallowing. The expression on her face looked like she was enjoying it. She no longer felt the pain of eating raw meat previously.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but sigh. Humans' adaptability was the strongest among all animals.

The little girl soon ate her fill. Then, she started to cut the thin mutton slices and prepare to store them.

Chu Xiaoye ate the entire antelope and only left some meat on the ribs for her.

After eating and drinking his fill, Chu Xiaoye jumped up the tree again. His eyes flickered with golden light as he checked the surrounding forest to see if there was any danger approaching.

There was no danger, but he saw the female cub leaving sneakily. It walked into the forest not far away and raised its tail to pee.

She even had to hide when urinating. This lioness seemed to know shame from her evolution.

However, under Chu Xiaoye's gaze, she had nowhere to hide. Even if she hid, she could see it clearly.

At this moment, he realized deeply that he was indeed a lion, and a lion that had matured early.

Perhaps, this was a chance, a chance to make him completely a lion.

At this moment, there was no reason to hesitate and retreat.

Be it his body or mind, they were urging and supporting him.

Success or failure depended on this one move\!

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate anymore. He looked down at the pride below and saw that no one was paying attention to him. He immediately jumped up and quietly jumped away from the tree.

He moved very quickly and anxiously, afraid that the courage he had just summoned would disappear again.

After urinating, Alisa did not return to the pride's camp immediately. Instead, she stood there, narrowed her eyes, and thought about her plan silently.

Just as she was thinking about successfully ascending to the throne and hugging and stepping on that smelly gangster, a figure suddenly flew down from above with a whoosh. Before she could react, he pushed her to the ground.

Alisa was shocked. Just as she was about to bite down, she realized that the attacker was that smelly rogue again\!

Chu Xiaoye pressed his two claws on her neck and looked at her forcefully. He expressed his intentions domineeringly and bravely. "Don't move\!"

Although he had already restrained the lioness cub's life, Chu Xiaoye still did not dare to use force.

Although the female cub's tail was not as powerful as Little Curly Tail's, it was also very agile and strong. Every time she slapped him, she was extremely fierce and vicious, making it impossible for him to guard against her and making him feel like dying.

No matter which position he was in, he could not avoid that tail.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to reason with her and persuade her.

Of course, the moment he jumped down from the tree, he had already lowered his tail and clamped his legs tightly, preparing protection in advance.

If threats were useless, they could only…

Chu Xiaoye saw that the female cub's eyes were wide with anger and seemed to be about to explode. He hurriedly flicked his golden claws and pierced them into her fur. He expressed his intentions with the attitude a lion king should have. "If you follow me, you can eat and drink spicy food with me in the future\! No one will dare to bully you again\!"

Alisa widened her eyes and bared her fangs. She would rather die than submit\!

Chu Xiaoye had long known that this move was useless to this female cub.

However, he did not give up.

He grinned and rubbed her fur with his hind claws. The dominance and ferocity on his face disappeared and he started to tempt her with benefits.

"Then, do you like authority? As long as you submit to me, this pride will be yours. And I will listen to you in the future and even submit to you\!"

He had long seen the female cub's intentions from her eyes. Threats might be useless to her, but authority and status were definitely a huge temptation to her. It even made her drool\!

Indeed, when he expressed this, the female cub under him was suddenly stunned. She slowly put away her fangs and looked at him with flickering eyes.

"This King's words are definitely true\! This King can swear to the heavens that if any of my words were fake, let this King…'s father be killed by the hyenas\!"

Chu Xiaoye swore.

How could a man's vow, especially to a woman he had just met, be true?

Chu Xiaoye mocked himself.

If he succeeded and immediately turned against her, what could this lioness cub do to him? She could only accept what was already done and completely become a member of his lioness harem\!

This was not despicable.

The world of animals did not have the word despicable.

In order to obtain the right to mate, every animal would do whatever it took to do so. He was not the only one.

"Then, can we start?"
