Chapter 406: Untitled

It seemed to have seen through the true leader of this team at a glance\!

"Whoosh\!"

Before Chu Xiaoye could attack, Catherine, who was behind him, suddenly jumped up from the ground. She swung her silver claw and slapped the jaguar.

Both sides were extremely fast\!

The jaguar's eyes flashed. It raised its claws and roared down with the sound of breaking air\!

It occupied an advantageous terrain from top to bottom. It was faster and stronger\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The two feet slapped each other heavily and the sharp claws crossed\!

Two figures, one up and one down.

Catherine landed on the ground again, and the jaguar actually used the strength of its counterattack to jump back onto the tree. Its strong body was as agile as an ape\!

Blood flowed out of Catherine's foot and a few deep wounds appeared on it.

The jaguar's claws trembled a few times and scarlet blood flowed out.

In the battle between the lion and jaguar, no one seemed to have gained the upper hand.

The jaguar stood on the thick branch with its head lowered. Its gaze at the female cub turned from disdain to seriousness.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine suddenly jumped up and landed on the tree trunk. Then, with a few leaps, she jumped onto the tree and stood on a branch at the same height as it, looking at it coldly.

The jaguar lowered its body slightly and narrowed its amber eyes to reevaluate this young female cub.

However, Catherine did not give it any time to look. With a whoosh, she shot out like a bolt of lightning and pounced forward. Her sharp claws flickered with a silver cold light in the dark forest\!

The jaguar flashed and jumped onto a higher branch.

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

The tree trunk that it was originally standing on was actually scratched by Catherine's silver claws\!

Leaves fell and wood fragments flew\!

Catherine jumped up and chased after him.

"Bang\!"

The jaguar's claws suddenly slapped down, but Catherine nimbly dodged them\!

Those heavy claws slapped heavily on a branch at the side and broke it with a crack.

Catherine took the opportunity to go up and cut a floating leaf in half with her silver claws. With a whoosh, she grabbed the abdomen of the jaguar.

The jaguar reacted extremely quickly and immediately jumped up. However, it did not leave. Instead, it suddenly landed and pounced at Catherine.

Its sharp fangs bit ferociously at Catherine's head\!

This rapid pounce had once killed countless ferocious beasts. As long as it pounced close and bit the skull, it would definitely die\!

However, Catherine stood in place. After her claw missed, she did not dodge, as if she could not react in time.

When the jaguar pounced close and the stench assaulted her, Catherine's claws that had just landed suddenly flew up. With a whoosh, she grabbed the jaguar's abdomen again\!

This was a ruthless and desperate fighting method.

When the jaguar's fangs bit her head, her claws would also pierce into the jaguar's abdomen and instantly open the stomach of this top predator that looked like a tiger or leopard\!

Her skull would definitely be bitten to pieces by the other party\!

She almost did not hesitate and prepared to use this desperate move to end this battle\!

The pride under the tree almost stopped beating when they saw their hearts.

The female cub's decisiveness and ruthlessness towards her enemies and herself shocked all the members.

Chu Xiaoye stood under the tree, his eyes flickering. He was not in a hurry to save her.

The little lioness's intelligence and courage exceeded his expectations again.

That jaguar would never die with it.

Indeed, when Catherine stood in place and used this method of death, the jaguar suddenly gave up on attacking. It swung its tail and hooked the branch above its head, its body suddenly flying towards the branch at the side.

However, when it hesitated and retreated, Catherine's claws had already pierced through his fur with a whoosh\!

Fortunately, it was fast enough and flew out in a flash, avoiding the tragedy of having its stomach cut open. It only left a few shallow wounds on its stomach.

The jaguar landed on a branch at the side, its stomach twitching slightly. Its eyes revealed a fierce expression, as if it was a little embarrassed and angry.

"Roar—"

It suddenly roared angrily, its fur standing on end, and the muscles on its front limbs bulged. With a whoosh, it shot towards Catherine\!

"Bang\!"

Catherine raised her claws to face it, but before she could land, she was hit heavily on the head by the rapidly flying jaguar. Her body tilted and she flew out, falling down the tree.

The jaguar succeeded in its attack and quickly fell, following closely behind Catherine. It suddenly grabbed at her abdomen, wanting to take revenge for almost having its stomach cut open by this female cub just now\!

However, right at this moment, Catherine, who originally looked like she was dizzy from the impact and could not resist, suddenly swung her tail upwards and slapped the jaguar's crotch heavily\!

"Roar —"

A miserable scream suddenly sounded in the forest.

Chu Xiaoye trembled in fear and clamped his hind legs tightly.

The sudden pain made the powerful jaguar's vision turn black and he lost all his strength.

Before it could land, Catherine, who had just landed, suddenly jumped up. She swung her silver claw and pierced its hard skin with a whoosh\!

"Whoosh\!"

Blood sprayed and internal organs splashed\!

Catherine landed on the ground, rolled out, and jumped up, instantly retreating a few meters.

The entire movement was smooth like flowing water\!

Under the intense pain, the jaguar that had its stomach cut open actually jumped up again after landing. It dragged its bloody intestines and brandished its sharp claws, pouncing on Catherine.

However, just as he pounced for a distance, he staggered and fell to the ground with a bang, sliding in front of Catherine.

It raised its head, widened its eyes, and raised its claws helplessly. It was furious and unwilling as it looked at the young female cub in front of it in despair and confusion.

Until this moment, it still could not believe that this female cub could be safe and sound after he crashed into her\!

The pain was already numb.

Blood flowed from his crotch and abdomen.

This jaguar, who had reigned supreme in this forest for many years, widened its eyes and died with a grievance.

Looking at the blurry flesh under its crotch, the cold father, Little Curly Tail, Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, and even Blue and the three warthogs felt terrified.

This female cub was indeed terrifying\!

Catherine wiped the blood on her claws on the grass and lowered her head. She quietly returned behind Chu Xiaoye and stood there like his shadow.

She was only a killer and a shadow.

Even if he became a cruel and despicable demon, even if he made all his companions fear and stay away.

As long as he did not mind.

This way, she was already satisfied.

Chu Xiaoye clamped his legs and turned to look at her with a complicated gaze.

The strength of the jaguar could be seen from the shining crystal whisker by its mouth and the corpses of the six lions.

However, he still died under the sharp claws of this female cub.

He originally wanted to see this female cub's true strength before preparing to help. Unexpectedly, this battle ended so quickly that he did not need to do anything.

When he fought such an enemy back then, he was always in danger and barely won.

Now, this female cub had actually finished off such an enemy so quickly. Although she had secretly learned the despicable methods of that despicable lioness, there was no doubt about her strength and growth\!

"Very good\!"

He clamped his hind legs and praised her with his eyes.

Catherine lowered her head and did not see it.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the jaguar's corpse and observed its body carefully. He could not help but sigh at the wonders of nature to be able to give birth to such a wonderful life.

"Roar\!"

Unexpectedly, right at this moment, this supposed dead jaguar suddenly jumped up and bit his neck\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and jumped up too, bringing it into the air.

The jaguar loosened its teeth and fell heavily to the ground. It widened its eyes and opened its mouth. Its intestines flowed all over the ground and it did not move.

The other members of the pride were also terrified.

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground with lingering fear. He took a few steps back and looked vigilantly at the jaguar that he did not know was really dead or not. His heart skipped a beat.

Was it haunted?

Catherine rushed over and pierced her claws into the jaguar's head, shattering its skull.

The jaguar lay on the ground with its eyes wide open and was completely motionless.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and wiped the saliva on his neck. He wiped the grass on the ground a few times before walking in front of the jaguar and observing it carefully.

This thing's life force was really strong.

If Catherine had not pretended to be knocked out and suddenly slapped the other party's life door, the other party would still be lively and jumping around.

After confirming that the jaguar was completely dead, Chu Xiaoye extended his claws into its blood. He waited for a while and saw that nothing unusual happened.

If he did not kill it, he naturally could not absorb its skills.

Furthermore, no one knew if this jaguar had yet to release its ultimate skill or if it did not have it at all. It did not have a very outstanding skill like the previous animals.

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and pierced into the jaguar's neck, carefully cutting open its fur.

The fur of the jaguar was very smooth and soft. It was a pity to throw it away. Why not use it to make a jaguar print coat and make it another set of clothes for the little girl.

In a crisis, the little girl could still wear this jaguar print dress and land on all fours, pretending to be a fierce beast and blend in with Belita and the others.

While Chu Xiaoye was cutting the jaguar fur, a female lion was fighting a group of crocodiles in the swamp a few kilometers away.

Two of the crocodiles were huge. The armor on their backs had scales that were flickering with a milky-white luster.

Their movements were exceptionally fierce and agile, forcing the female lion to retreat step by step.
