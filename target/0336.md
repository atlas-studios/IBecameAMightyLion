Chapter 336: Blood-soaked Rebirth\!

The atmosphere was strangely quiet.

No one knew if the black python was digesting something. After crawling out of the ground, it lay there with its mouth open and did not move.

Balo was bewildered, as if he wanted to go forward to check, but he felt that it was inappropriate.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Catherine, who was already unable to stand steadily, suddenly rushed over without care. Her dark eyes were filled with crystalline tears.

She seemed to have sensed something.

"Bang\!"

However, before she could run over, Balo had already blocked her path. He swung his claws and sent her flying.

Catherine fell heavily to the ground, her entire body covered in wounds and dripping with blood. She was almost unconscious, but she still struggled to raise her head and look at the black python.

She could not stand up, but she slowly crawled over.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Tilly stood in place, trembling.

Previously, they had never been afraid even when facing death. But now, when they saw the thing that bulged on the black python's body, they were exceptionally terrified.

Like Catherine, they thought of something.

However, they did not dare to believe or be willing to believe it.

Little Curly Tail's entire body was trembling as he looked over in fear. Broken Tail was trembling non-stop behind him.

No, that was not his brother.

His brother was the smartest and strongest lion king of the grassland. No one was qualified to hurt him\!

However, why was he so terrified?

Mei Mei was just like him, terrified and helpless.

Tilly stood frozen in place, her gaze blank.

Catherine was still crawling forward with a scarlet trail of blood on the ground. The open wound on her body revealed white bones and bright red internal organs.

Balo looked at her and did not hesitate anymore. He growled and let the ten black lions come over. He wanted to end the battle quickly in case anything happened.

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, the black python that was originally lying on the ground motionless suddenly swung its tail and slapped a rock at the side\!

Stone fragments splashed and the rock shattered on the spot.

Then, the black python suddenly started to roll and twist. It swung its tail everywhere and let out banging sounds, looking like it was in extreme pain.

The ten black lions immediately fled in fear.

The thick snake tail was like an iron rod that swung crazily around, causing the rocks to fly everywhere.

Balo's gaze turned cold. Just as he was about to rush up and completely end this crazy black python, with a puff, the place where the python's throat bulged suddenly broke open and a string of blood flew up.

Then, a golden claw extended\!

Balo's heart trembled and his face was filled with disbelief.

Catherine, who was crawling forward, suddenly stopped and raised her head, looking blankly at the familiar golden claw.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately trembled in excitement and were about to roar.

Tilly slowly raised her golden claw and extended it in a daze, as if she wanted to grab the golden claw that extended from the python's body.

The crazily rolling black python suddenly quietened down.

The surroundings were deathly silent.

"Pfftâ€”"

Then, another blood splashed\!

The snake meat and skin that were almost transparent from being stuffed immediately exploded, revealing a bloody hole\!

Then, a head popped out.

At the same time, there was also a lush golden mane behind the head. It was soft, beautiful, and full of luster. It was not stained with any blood, as if it had just grown.

"Bam\!"

The black python's head suddenly fell and the body near the head exploded\!

Chu Xiaoye crawled out with a blank expression. Did he come out just like that?

He turned around and saw that his neck was already covered in a golden mane. He was no longer the thin circle of golden fur from before\!

Before his second birthday, he had already become an adult lion\!

He raised his head and looked forward.

The black lion king was looking at him with its eyes wide open. Its face was distorted, as if it had seen a ghost.

Further ahead, Catherine was lying on the ground with tears in her dark eyes.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Tilly were all seriously injured and dripping with blood. At this moment, they were looking at him excitedly and in disbelief.

To be honest, even he found it unbelievable.

He originally only wanted to place his head on the black python's throat and quietly heal his wounds and recover his strength. Unexpectedly, in the end, when he looked at the internal organs of the black python, he became more and more curious. He subconsciously twisted forward and crawled in. In the end, not only did he escape the suppression of the stone, he even completely crawled into the stomach of the black python\!

He did not know whether to laugh or cry.

Fortunately, it was quite warm and soft inside. Furthermore, for some reason, the blood and stomach juice could not stain his fur.

Hence, he started to move around inside.

One moment, he was lying on his stomach, standing, squatting, and jumping.

The black python was frightened crazy. It started to swing its body crazily underground and hit everywhere. In the end, it accidentally brought him out.

Now that he had seen the light of day and returned to life, it was all thanks to this black python.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at it.

In order to thank this black python, he raised his claws and kicked the other party's head into the distance, lest it was too sad to see its badly mutilated body leave it.

The snake body that was separated from its head was still twisting and rolling on the ground. Then, it rolled further and further away. In the end, it abandoned its head and rolled down the hill.

As for the bloody snake head, it was lying alone under a rock, staring with its eyes wide open. It was miserable and pitiful.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at it again. He raised his head and looked at the black lion king.

Balo also looked at him. His aura, which had been disdainful just now, seemed to have weakened a lot at this moment, and his gaze was resentful and grave.

He was not dead??

The ten strong black lions seemed to be a little hesitant as they looked at him in bewilderment. They were careful and did not immediately surround him.

Chu Xiaoye looked past the black lion king and at Catherine, who was lying on the ground. He looked at Little Curly Tail, who was covered in blood, at Mei Mei, and at Tilly.

A flame burned in his chest\!

His hot claws easily pierced through the rocks on the ground. His flickering golden eyes saw through everything in the night.

The night was the world of the black lions.

However, now, he was going to use this night to bury all the hope of this group of black lions on this rocky hill and never be able to turn around\!

"Whoosh\!"

His golden mane was like a blooming flame that drew a beautiful arc in the night under the moonlight.
