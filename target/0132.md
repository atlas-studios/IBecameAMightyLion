Chapter 132: Mother's Strength

"Roar—"

At this moment, the injured cheetah mother finally discovered him and the little elephant behind him. She immediately bared her fangs in fear.

The two little cheetahs also hurriedly hid behind her and bared their teeth.

An adult cheetah was smaller than a leopard and naturally smaller than a lion.

Even if Chu Xiaoye was not yet a year old, his rapidly strengthening body was still slightly bigger than hers.

Furthermore, even leopards were afraid of lions, let alone cheetahs.

Although cheetahs looked a little similar to leopards, they did not belong to the same species and their habits and hunting methods were also different.

The most obvious difference between the two was that there was a tear under each of the cheetahs' eyes and they looked like they were about to cry.

As for the leopards, they did not.

Cheetahs usually relied on their extreme speed to catch prey. They were the fastest animals on the grassland and even the entire land.

However, their endurance was very weak.

As for leopards, they relied on sneak attacks to catch prey. Be it their size or strength, they were much larger than cheetahs.

Sometimes, hungry leopards would even hunt cheetahs as a meal.

Leopards usually hid in the forest and bushes. Even after being injured, they could attack their prey and have a higher success rate when hunting.

As for cheetahs, after they were injured, they could only wait for death silently.

Even when they were healthy, their success rate when hunting was very low. They could only succeed once after hunting for about six to seven times.

Now, this cheetah mother was seriously injured and could only wait for death slowly.

Her two children would starve to death too.

At this moment, she faced Chu Xiaoye and bared her fangs in fear. She retreated with difficulty with the two children. The blood in her abdomen flowed down her thigh and landed on the ground.

She retreated under a tree and could not move anymore. She bent her hind legs and squatted down, still baring her fangs and letting out a fierce whimper.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked behind him.

The ten-over hyenas had their mouths open as they chased after him while panting.

He turned around and walked towards the forest on the right.

The little elephant immediately followed behind him like a shadow.

The hyenas cried out and chased after him.

Their noses were very sensitive, and they could naturally smell the scent of blood in the air.

Chu Xiaoye did not go far. Instead, he came under a big tree and lay down with his butt facing the big tree.

He had to recover his strength as soon as possible.

As for the little elephant, it was like him, leaning its butt against the tree and standing beside him.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to slap it and make it scram.

However, he could not waste his energy at this time. Furthermore, his slap was not much use to this little elephant who weighed seven to eight hundred kilograms.

As for letting out smelly farts to suffocate it, it was even more useless.

From the previous situation, this little stupid elephant was the first creature that was not afraid of his farts and actually liked to smell his farts.

This made him feel a deep sense of defeat, and he had to admit that elephants were the number one overlord of the African grassland.

The hyenas quickly walked into the forest and surrounded them.

However, they immediately smelled the fresh blood. The leading female hyena brought the three hyenas and walked towards the injured cheetah mother. The other hyenas still surrounded Chu Xiaoye and the little elephant.

They would not waste any delicious food\!

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground and ignored the hyenas in front of him. He looked at the leading hyena.

Even if the cheetah was not injured, it could only flee in front of the hyenas.

Now, she was seriously injured and facing the four hyenas, she had no chance to resist.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her from afar and the two children beside her. His eyes flickered, but he did not intend to do anything.

This was not something he should care about.

And his current situation did not allow him to care.

He was a lion\!

At least, he had to be like a lion\!

Cheetahs did not know how to roar. Even when they were angry and afraid, they could only let out cat-like cries.

When the hyena leader walked over with her three companions, the heavily injured cheetah mother suddenly jumped up and pounced at the hyena leader\!

The hyena leader was clearly caught off guard. He hurriedly opened his mouth to bite, but he was a step too slow\!

The cheetah mother bit its nose with all her might and actually bit off its nose and the flesh on its face\!

The hyena leader immediately let out a scream and hurriedly ran back. His face was covered in blood and his head swayed in pain.

The three hyenas behind it were immediately stunned by the cheetah mother's ferocity. They immediately stopped in place and let out threatening cries, but they did not dare to move forward\!

The cheetah mother's stomach was dripping with blood, but she was baring her sharp teeth and fighting with all her might\!

The two little cheetahs followed behind her, also baring their teeth and letting out cries.

The three hyenas were clearly frightened and retreated.

As for the hyena leader, she was still terrified and did not dare to move forward. She shook his head and turned around to walk towards Chu Xiaoye.

The cheetah was already seriously injured. She could not run far and could not last long. They only needed to wait. There was no need to go forward and risk their lives.

Now, it was more important to bite this little lion to death and eat the plump little elephant first.

They had a natural hatred for lions. As long as they encountered lone lions, they would definitely kill them\!

Furthermore, this was a young lion\!

After every lion grew a mane, they would be the nightmare of their hyenas\!

Therefore, as long as there was a chance, they would never show mercy\!

The hyena leader's face was covered in blood as he let out an angry roar and ordered his subordinates to attack quickly\!

Chu Xiaoye leaned against the tree and raised his head, looking coldly at this group of ugly fellows as if he was looking at a group of clowns.

Whoever came first would die\!

When he recovered his strength, none of these clowns would survive\!

Of course, there was also the little stupid elephant beside him that had attracted trouble\!

He promised to eat all the elephant meat on its body and its long nose that liked to smell smelly farts\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and bared his fangs, showing the dignity and ferocity of a lion to the hyenas that were preparing to pounce on him\!

He was a true lion\!

However, his appearance was clearly a little childish and miserable. No matter how loud his roar was, it did not seem to have any deterrence.

The hyenas immediately bared their fangs and revealed faces even more ferocious than his. They pounced forward majestically\!

The little elephant beside him finally started to fear.

It turned around and used its elephant nose to push Chu Xiaoye's butt, looking flustered.

No one knew if it was telling Chu Xiaoye to continue pouting and farting, or if it wanted Chu Xiaoye to move forward so that it could hide behind his butt.

This rascal\!

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He raised his hind leg and kicked its nose mercilessly\!
