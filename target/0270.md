Chapter 270: Subduing the Lion King

"Roar—"

The one-eyed lion king was furious\!

This slap not only landed on his face, it also landed on his dignity and honor.

He stood up from the ground and pounced at Chu Xiaoye.

He had already let the other party attack first.

Now, it was his turn\!

"Whoosh\!"

He jumped up, raised his huge claws, and slapped Chu Xiaoye.

The wind whistled aggressively\!

Chu Xiaoye stood in place like he did previously. He did not jump to face the attack or retreat. When his claws were about to fall, he raised his claws and swung them up.

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The two claws collided heavily\!

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled and he stood in place without moving.

As for the one-eyed lion king, it flew out diagonally and landed on the ground. It suddenly lost its balance and staggered a few steps to the side, almost falling.

This time, it was a true competition of strength.

Furthermore, the one-eyed lion king's jump attack had an advantage in strength. However, it was still defeated.

The pride of the cold father and the pride behind him roared excitedly again.

As for the one-eyed lion king's subordinates and pride, at this moment, it was dead silent. No one made a sound.

They still looked at their king with burning eyes, hoping that he could show his true strength and turn the tables.

At this moment, no one doubted the strength of this young lion.

The one-eyed lion king stood there, its feet feeling numb. It looked at the young lion king in front of it in shock. Clearly, it could not believe the strength fight just now.

Such powerful strength could actually erupt from this young body?

However, he would never admit defeat so easily.

His victory not only concerned his honor, it also concerned the honor of the pride\!

"Roar—"

He pounced forward again\!

This time, he revealed his sharp claws.

A battle could not be determined by life and death, but victory and defeat had to be determined.

Since they wanted to determine the victor, they naturally could not avoid being injured.

A battle between lions was meant to see blood.

At this moment, he had already treated this young lion as a true opponent\!

He would not hold back any means\!

His mane fluttered and the skin under his fur revealed a metallic luster. His aura instantly became stronger and more ferocious\!

His roar was like thunder and his claws were like blades\!

"Whoosh\!"

His sharp claws mercilessly grabbed Chu Xiaoye's head\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped to the side and dodged.

The one-eyed lion king roared angrily again and pounced forward, its sharp claws raised high.

Chu Xiaoye still did not face the attack and jumped away again.

The one-eyed lion king continued to pounce.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he continued to jump and dodge.

That agile figure swayed in front of the one-eyed lion king like a breeze. It moved left and right, advancing and retreating with ease, as if it was taking a leisurely stroll. The one-eyed lion king's claws could not touch him at all.

"Roar—"

After entangling for more than ten minutes, the one-eyed lion king was finally angered. It seemed to have lost its mind as it crazily swung its claws around.

His skin was thick and his flesh was rough. He was strong, but in the other party's agile movements and rapid reactions, he was useless.

Every time he attacked, he was full of strength, but the other party easily dodged it.

Soon, his crazy pounce and attack exhausted most of his strength. His movements gradually slowed down and were no longer as ferocious as before. He was also panting.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in place and waited for him to continue attacking.

The one-eyed lion king finally stopped. The anger on its face gradually disappeared and a hint of frustration appeared in its eyes.

Perhaps, the bystanders did not know the outcome this time. Or perhaps, they thought that this young lion was afraid of his sharp claws and could only dodge blindly.

However, he knew that he was defeated again.

In this competition, he had lost in many ways. Speed, reaction speed, mental state, stamina, and even intelligence.

He looked fierce, but he was completely played by the other party.

The calm and composure he was originally proud of was completely defeated by this young lion king's simple dodge and provocation and turned to nothingness.

The other party had successfully angered him and made him reveal his lion nature, causing him to completely lose his mind in anger.

This might not affect anything in a one-on-one battle between lions, but in a group battle and under his command as the leader, it would become a fatal mistake.

Therefore, this time, he was utterly convinced of his defeat.

However, the other party had yet to defeat him.

He did not fall and could still stand up. He was not threatened to die and could still resist.

Therefore, he still did not lose. He still had a chance of winning\!

"Roar—"

He roared angrily, indicating that he could still fight\!

It was still uncertain who would win\!

"Roar—"

The six lions, his female lions, and the pride behind him also let out excited roars, encouraging him and believing that he could definitely defeat the other party\!

The one-eyed lion's gaze was determined and it became confident again.

He bared his fangs and bared his sharp claws, preparing to restore the might of the lion king\!

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye's figure flashed like a bolt of lightning in the night. He suddenly erupted with his fastest speed and rushed towards him\!

Before the one-eyed lion king could react, a golden light suddenly lit up in front of him. Then, it followed his back and flashed past like a meteor\!

"Whoosh\!"

A spark extended from his neck to his tail\!

A burning pain burned his shining metallic skin like flames, causing his entire body to tremble and he suddenly jumped up.

Chu Xiaoye stood behind him, his golden claws flickering with a charming luster under the moonlight. A drop of blood fell from above.

A straight line of blood appeared on the one-eyed lion king's armor-like skin from its neck to the root of its tail. Its fur was broken, its flesh was flipped open, and blood flowed out.

There was only one blood line.

In other words, only one claw pierced through his armor and his skin.

However, it was definitely not because other claws could not pierce his armor.

Because he could clearly feel that only the claw had scratched his back.

This young lion king deliberately used only one of its claws\!

The one-eyed lion king stood in place in a daze. The muscles on its back were trembling slightly, not because of the pain, but because it found it unbelievable.

In the countless battles in the past, those powerful species could not pierce his skin with their sharp claws. But now, this young lion king had left a bloody wound on him with just one claw\!

What sharp claws were those\!

The other party's lightning-like speed flashed past so quickly that he could not react in time\!

If the other party wanted to kill him, would he have a chance to resist?

It turned out that this young lion king had not used his full strength from the beginning to the end. From the beginning to the end, it had been giving in to him.

This discovery was difficult for him to accept and made him ashamed\!

However, defeat was defeat.

No matter how difficult it was to accept, he had to accept reality.

Only a stronger leader could lead their homeless companions to kill their way back to the grassland and reclaim their homes to take revenge for their dead family and companions\!

The one-eyed lion king did not hesitate.

He took a few steps forward and walked in front of the young lion king. He slowly lowered his noble head to show that he had lost and that he was willing to submit, follow by his side, and bow down to him.

"Roar—"

At this moment, the six lions in his pride immediately roared angrily with anger and unwillingness.

They stood out, unwilling to accept this outcome.

They would never let their king submit to a young lion\!

The seven brothers had once roamed the grassland and defeated countless powerful lions. How could they degrade themselves and bow down to a kid who had yet to grow a mane?

They bared their fangs and let out angry roars. They looked provocatively at the young lion king.

They wanted to challenge him\!

At this moment, Mixed Fur and the other six lions, the members of the pride of the cold father, all stood out. They also bared their fangs and let out angry roars.

The pride behind the pride of the cold father immediately became excited and roared angrily, glaring at them angrily.

He could not afford to lose and wanted to bully others with numbers?

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei revealed killing intent.

Catherine flicked her silver claws and her gaze was cold. She was like a bow that was pulled full of strings, ready to shoot at any time and open her stomach\!

The one-eyed lion king immediately turned around and roared angrily, looking sternly at his six subordinates.

However, the six lions were still indignant and unwilling to fail.

They saw that their king had gathered so many prides and that their prides were about to fight in this grassland and would even dominate the grassland in the future. Now, a young kid suddenly appeared and wanted them to bow down and surrender the prides they gathered. How could they tolerate this?

For the sake of benefits and power, even brothers and father and son could fall out, let alone companions.

Seeing their boss, who was timid and weak, actually respecting a young kid as king and giving up their benefits and rights without hesitation, these six lions were extremely angry and looked fierce as if they were preparing to rebel.

A cold glint flashed in the one-eyed lion king's eyes as it looked at the pride behind the six lions.

The pride that had followed him all the way was silent at this moment. They all lowered their heads silently and did not express anything, as if they could follow anyone.

Just as he was about to flare up and prepare to put justice before family, Chu Xiaoye stopped him. He looked at the six lions and then at the pride.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this situation was not a coincidence. It could happen when any new king replaced the old king.

After all, it was related to his own interests.

No one wanted the benefits that they could have obtained to suddenly disappear or become uncertain.

There was only one way to resolve this situation.

Furthermore, he, the new king, had to do it personally.

Although it was a little cruel, this was not the time to be soft-hearted.

Changing any dynasty required blood.

He had to stabilize the situation with lightning speed before all the prides were stirred and a rebellion happened\!

"Roar—"

Therefore, when the six lions bared their fangs and roared at him again, provoking him fiercely, he did not hesitate and rushed over.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

The roar stopped and the lion's head fell to the ground\!

This time, he did not show any mercy and almost used his fastest speed and strongest strength\!

As a ghost, his claws were like lightning\!

Under the golden claw, there was no noise\!

In the blink of an eye, the six lions' heads fell to the ground, blood sprayed, and they died on the spot\!

All the uneasiness and commotion instantly stopped\!

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the pride. His golden claws were covered in scarlet blood and flickered with a demonic and cold luster under the moonlight.
