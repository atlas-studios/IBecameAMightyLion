Chapter 278: Brother Changed Again

"Whoosh—"

Just as Tilly was squatting in the bushes to pee, a black shadow suddenly jumped past her like a wind. She could not react in time, let alone see clearly.

She was so frightened that her body trembled and she held in her unfinished urine.

At the same time, a familiar stench drifted over with the night wind and crawled into her nose.

"Smelly fart king\! Shameless\!"

She glared in the direction where the black shadow disappeared.

In the orchard.

When Belita was on the tree eating the wild rabbit she had just caught with relish, a black shadow suddenly rushed past her and brought away her beloved rabbit, leaving behind a terrifying black smoke.

"Ugh —"

She immediately spat out the food that she had just eaten.

"Big fart\! I'm not done with you\!"

Belita cursed angrily as she vomited.

"Whoosh—"

In the night, Chu Xiaoye spat out black smoke as he ate the rabbit meat that he had just abducted. He was like the wind in the bushes, coming and going without a trace. He was so fast that his figure could not be seen clearly\!

Catherine had already lost him.

The little lioness stood in place dejectedly and looked at the darkness in the distance. Her expression was lonely and her heart ached.

Ever since she was young, she had been chasing after his figure and never missed a step. Now, she could not catch up to him in the end.

He was not her only king. He was the king of all the members here and in the future, the king of all the prides on the grassland. He was destined to be further and further away from her.

Until one day, he would never look at her again.

"Whoosh—"

Just as Catherine lowered her head and was about to return to the bushes to grieve, the figure that left like the wind floated back like the wind. Furthermore, it brought her a bloody rabbit leg.

Catherine looked up at him with trembling eyes. Her dark eyes were filled with tears.

Chu Xiaoye bit the rabbit leg and stuffed it into her mouth. Just as he was about to show off his speed, Belita's roar suddenly sounded from the tree behind him.

"Big smelly fart\! Return me my rabbit\! Return me my rabbit\!"

Belita stood on the tree with her head lowered and looked at him angrily.

"Pfft—"

With an explosion, black smoke rose\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the tree with a whoosh and instantly appeared in front of her. He suddenly jumped and rode on her. Black smoke continued to surge behind him, instantly enveloping her entire head and body.

"Ugh —"

Belita, who had just vomited, vomited again.

After the black smoke cleared, Chu Xiaoye climbed down from the tree.

As for Belita, she lay on a branch, rolled her eyes, and fainted.

"Roar—"

"Despicable\!"

Tilly roared angrily and jumped over from the forest beside her.

This despicable and shameless kid actually peeped at her peeing\!

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and looked up at her, narrowing his eyes.

"Whoosh—"

Tilly turned around and jumped away, running faster than a monkey.

Belita's previous lesson made her learn to judge the situation and escape at any time.

This fellow's smelly farts was becoming more and more terrifying. It could even be used to increase speed. It was simply her nightmare.

Chu Xiaoye gave her a disdainful look and turned to leave, preparing to patrol the border.

Although he was a king and did not need to patrol personally, he only needed to maintain his energy and be prepared to deal with sudden situations.

However, he was too full of energy and did not feel sleepy at all. Now that he had mastered the divine technique, he would feel terrible if he did not wander around.

Over the past few days, many new members had joined.

Under the management of Lars and the one-eyed lion king, the team was expanding methodically and their combat strength was gradually increasing. Everything was developing in a good direction.

If he could be given more time, that would be even better.

However, clearly, those black lions would not wait long.

Tonight, Little Curly Tail and Molly were patrolling the borders.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye personally designated this.

When he designated the two fellows to go out and patrol, Mei Mei was shocked. She immediately persuaded them worriedly, afraid that they would fight outside.

However, under his insistence, no one dared to object.

Mei Mei wanted to follow but was reprimanded by him. She could only obediently stay at home to sleep.

She still had to patrol tomorrow.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye walked out of the bushes and walked towards the border. From afar, he saw two figures walking side by side in the darkness, looking around seriously.

When Chu Xiaoye walked close, he was shocked to discover that Little Curly Tail's tail was actually wrapped around Molly's tail. He looked arrogant and pleased with himself.

If Molly walked too slowly or displayed a bad attitude, Little Curly Tail's tail would suddenly tug. The pain made Molly grimace. She wanted to roar, but she did not dare to.

The little lioness gritted her teeth in hatred, but she could not defeat him. She could only endure the humiliation and walk hatefully.

Chu Xiaoye watched this scene and the corner of his mouth twitched. His smelly brother was like a pig. No, he was even worse than a pig and did not have any protective feelings for the fairer sex.

How could this be possible?

How could a dignified lion, a male lion with vigorous hormones or about to flourish, treat a female cub like this?

Could it be that our family will be extinct in the future?

He decided to teach this brat a lesson and make him a lion\!

In a lion's life, not only did it have to know how to fight, it also had to know how to mate, inherit genes, and reproduce\!

No matter how powerful or strong you were, you did not know how to mate. What was the use\!

"Roar—"

Just as Little Curly Tail was pulling Molly's tail fiercely again, Chu Xiaoye immediately roared angrily and walked over.

When Little Curly Tail saw that it was him, he immediately cried out in excitement. He swung his tail and actually sent Molly flying. Then, he circled above his head and ran around proudly.

"Brother, look. This female cub can even fly in the sky. Hahahahahaha…"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him, causing his head to tilt and he fell to the ground.

Molly also fell to the ground, embarrassed and angry. She buried her face in the grass, not daring to let this young king see her.

"Get up\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped his smelly brother's head again and roared at him.

The excitement and flaunting on Little Curly Tail's face immediately turned to grievance and confusion. He hurriedly stood up and looked at his brother in confusion.

What happened to his brother?

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye roared angrily and walked over to step on the root of his tail, letting him untie Molly\!

Little Curly Tail trembled in pain and hurriedly let go of his tail.

"You're not allowed to bully Molly again in the future, do you hear me?"

Chu Xiaoye patted his head and gave him a stern warning.

He originally thought that their quarrel would be like those sweet dramas of humans and that the two sides would end up together. Who would have thought that this kid would actually not understand and become more and more overboard? He actually treated this lioness cub as a toy\! He was really disappointed\!

If this continued, with this female cub's patient and determined personality, she might suddenly kill him one day.

Therefore, he could not let this smelly brother continue to mess around.

"Did you hear that?"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him again and glared at him.

Little Curly Tail could only lower his head and express that he had heard it with a wronged expression.

"Brother changed again… Wu…"

Little Curly Tail was very sad.

Chu Xiaoye glared at him and ignored him. He turned around and left.

He decided to hide in the grass in the distance and watch this kid's performance.
