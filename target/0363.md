Chapter 363: Untitled

The atmosphere was a little strange.

The black-haired lion king and the five lions behind it looked at the young lion in front of them in shock.

The strong and extraordinary blue-eyed lion actually took the initiative to retreat and let this young lion fight. This made them feel unbelievable.

Could it be that the king of this pride was him?

The female lions behind them were shocked when they recognized Chu Xiaoye, and their eyes were filled with fear.

They still remembered clearly how this young lion killed their pride and returned in defeat with its own strength. In the end, it used its powerful strength to make their former king, the blue-eyed lion king, submit willingly.

This young lion was their true king\!

Now that he had returned, he was naturally the one fighting.

These female lions knew very well how strong this young lion king was, so at this moment, they were all terrified.

The black-haired lion king looked deeply at the young lion in front of it, then at Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, and the other lions.

"Roarâ€”"

He suddenly growled and took a few steps forward, walking in front of Chu Xiaoye. He took the initiative to challenge him with a grave gaze and waited solemnly.

This young lion king was actually able to make these few strong lions submit. It definitely had some ability.

He naturally would not underestimate it\!

However, if he fought alone, he was confident that with his strength and skill as a fighter, he could make the other party fall to the ground and beg for mercy in a few rounds\!

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, just as he was thinking this, a claw suddenly whipped over at lightning speed and slapped him heavily in the face, sending him flying\!

He did not have the time to resist or dodge.

It was too fast\!

The black-haired lion king fell to the ground in a sorry state and got up with a roll. Its mouth was full of blood and its ears were buzzing. It looked at the figure in a daze, seemingly stunned.

"Whoosh\!"

The figure rushed up again.

This time, the black-haired lion king was prepared. It immediately raised its huge claws and slapped down\!

With his strength, no matter which part of the other party he slapped, his bones would break\!

However, to his surprise, his claw missed and he was sent flying again, landing seven to eight meters away.

For a moment, he was dizzy and his vision turned black. He struggled a few times and could not stand up.

The powerful strength and combat skills he had evolved could not be used at this moment. They were actually useless in front of the other party's lightning-like speed\!

He shook his head hard and stood up.

However, just as he stood up, he was sent flying for the third time.

Chu Xiaoye did not use a jet technique, but even so, his speed still made this black-haired lion king, who had not seen much of the world, despair.

The black-haired lion king fell heavily to the ground for the third time. Its vision turned black and it fainted.

Chu Xiaoye felt bored.

He originally thought that this lion king that had occupied the nest was so powerful. Looking at his size and aura, he was not inferior to Blue Eyes at all. However, his strength was clearly inferior to Blue Eyes.

Now, after experiencing the life and death tempering of that period of time, his strength and speed had both increased qualitatively.

As for this black-haired lion king, it was clearly still stuck in the former Blue Eyes strength.

The two blood rains gave most creatures a chance to become stronger. However, true strength still needed to be tempered with their genes and perseverance.

If he stayed in this place for a long time, the chances of him encountering training were very limited. He could only encounter some wandering lions to practice, so his strength naturally could not improve.

Why was Little Curly Tail becoming stronger and stronger? That was because even if he only stayed in that small area in the past, he would often go out to challenge other lions to train himself and never slack off.

Why was their team becoming stronger and stronger? Because their battles had never stopped.

Of course, everyone wanted a peaceful life.

However, this world did not allow it.

The quietly approaching mutated tides and changes in the biological chain would make this world more and more unstable. It was difficult to live calmly.

Chu Xiaoye did not fart again.

He looked at the unconscious black-haired lion king, turned around, and walked towards the five lions.

The five lions were already terrified by his lightning-like three consecutive slaps, but they had no choice but to bite the bullet and roar as they rushed up.

Because they knew that they could not escape.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Five muffled sounds sounded almost at the same time.

The five strong lions could not resist at all and were sent flying. Then, they stacked together like a pyramid\!

Chu Xiaoye's move not only stunned the five lions and the female lions, he also stunned the members of his team\!

The five strong lions were stacked neatly together and did not fall down at all. They were like gods, clever and magical\!

Little Curly Tail widened his eyes and his excited tail turned into a propeller. He spun above his head and almost flew up.

For the first time, Tilly's beautiful eyes looked at this fellow in admiration.

The little girl, who was protected by Catherine, widened her eyes and opened her mouth slightly. Her exquisite little face was filled with admiration.

To be honest, even Chu Xiaoye could not help but marvel at his skill of creating a lion pyramid. His slap technique had already reached perfection and he could do as he pleased. His strength and direction were just right and not even a centimeter off\!

"Whoosh\!"

The five lions struggled and fell to the ground. After getting up, they stood in place, their eyes filled with fear, desperation, and helplessness.

The crushing strength had already made them despair.

The female lions also stood in place, trembling, not knowing what to do.

Obviously, the outcome had been determined and this territory had changed owners again.

The young and powerful lion in front of them had become their lion king again.

However, they were already pregnant. The new lion king would never let them keep their children.

The five lions and the female lions were terrified, but they did not dare to escape.

Because they knew that in front of this young lion king, they could not escape.

The female lions were also unwilling to leave their home with their children.

The new lion king determined their lives.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the uneasy, terrified, and helpless female lions. Then, he looked at their bulging stomachs.

A fierce look appeared in his blue eyes.

Chu Xiaoye did not decide anything. Instead, he looked at Blue Eyes and let him decide.

The black-haired lion king and the five lions had clearly killed Blue Eyes' children and some loyal subordinates. He naturally had to take revenge personally.

As for the pregnant female lions, Chu Xiaoye would not interfere and let him deal with them himself.

Blue Eyes walked to his side and thanked him with a low voice. Then, he walked towards the gradually waking black-haired lion king. He swung his claws and slapped the other party's head.

"Bang\!"

With a crisp sound, his skull shattered\!

The black-haired lion king had just woken up when it received this fatal blow. Blood immediately flowed from its mouth and nose, and it let out a roar.

The other five lions were terrified. They could not care less and turned to escape.

However, Little Curly Tail and Tilly had already quietly blocked their path.

"We want to play too\!"

Little Curly Tail's wagging tail and Tilly's bright eyes both expressed their interest.
