Chapter 47: Bill's Pride

"Roar—"

At this moment, the roar of another lion sounded\!

The roar this time was also not Bill's\!

In other words, there was not only one invading wandering lion, but two\!

They might very well be brothers\!

The cold father and the female lions became increasingly nervous.

Right at this moment, Bill's roar finally sounded after a long time, as if he was fighting.

The female lions finally heaved a sigh of relief.

It turned out that the two wandering lions were not invading their territory, but the territory of Bill.

However, the cold father's expression was still grave.

He hesitated for a moment and immediately walked towards the bushes.

He decided to go to the border to see the situation.

The female lions looked at the young cubs, hurriedly called out a few times, and followed them.

At this dangerous moment, they had to let the children follow beside the lion.

Many times, when the lions went to the border to patrol the territory, some wandering lions would take the opportunity to invade and kill the young cubs.

Therefore, they had to be careful.

When Chu Xiaoye heard his mother's cry, he could only climb down from the tree and follow her with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

Passing through the dense bushes was their neighbor's territory.

The entire forest was split into two by the two prides and each occupied half.

They could not cross the line and could only stand in the bushes and look through the gaps in the leaves.

Bill's pride seemed to be resting in the shade of the bushes.

At this moment, Bill stood up and looked ahead with a dignified gaze. He let out a terrifying roar, as if he was warning the enemy.

However, he did not take the initiative to go forward.

Usually, when a lion discovered an invader, it would fly into a rage and take the initiative to run up and fight.

However, this time, it was two lions.

Furthermore, looking at the color of their manes, they were all young and strong male lions. This was the time when they were brave and eager to fight\!

Bill was afraid.

Although he was still young and strong, he was outnumbered.

The female lions and young cubs behind him were all terrified.

Obviously, the other party's two wandering lions had been coveting their territory and the six female lions in their territory for a long time.

They might have waited for years.

Now, they finally looked strong enough and had the confidence to challenge the lion king of this territory\!

Chu Xiaoye quickly climbed up a big tree at the side and stood on the highest branch.

He could see the situation on the other side.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately followed.

Not far away.

The two lions with lush manes let out provocative roars and walked towards the pride of lions.

They walked side by side very slowly, as if they were taking a walk in their territory. Their arrogant and calm aura gave Bill a lot of pressure.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked at his father.

The cold father looked on with a dark gaze. His muscles were tense, and he seemed to think of Bill as himself.

"Roar—"

Bill roared angrily again and warned the other party.

But.

The two lions still walked over fearlessly.

The female lions of the pride looked at the two lions in fear and anxiety, and they let out hoarse growls.

If Bill grew old or did not have the ability to protect them, if their children had already grown up, they would not be afraid of such a situation anymore and would even faintly look forward to it.

Some lionesses would even work together to chase away the old and weak male lions and take the initiative to welcome the younger and stronger male lions.

Only in this way could the pride continue to reproduce and survive.

But now, Bill was still young and strong. Most importantly, their children were underage.

Once the wandering lion snatched the throne and occupied this territory and them, their children would be cruelly killed.

Every lion that successfully ascended the throne wanted the lionesses to nurture their offspring.

Therefore, at this very moment, the six female lions of Bill's pride were extremely terrified.

However, even so, when Bill was fighting the two wandering lions, they would not go over to help.

This seemed to have become the rule of every pride.

Only the lion that won in battle was the strongest and was most qualified to claim the territory and pride.

Only in this way could the pride reproduce better.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye had seen exceptions before.

Some lionesses helped the lion chase away the wandering lions.

However, this exception clearly would not happen in Bill's pride today.

When the two wandering lions started to run over, Bill roared and rushed up alone\!

The battle started\!

Dust flew everywhere and roars could be heard continuously\!

The two wandering lions worked together and roared as they bit at Bill\!

Bill roared and counterattacked with all his might\!

As for the female lions and young cubs of Bill's pride, they stood at the side in panic and watched anxiously.

The battle only lasted for a few minutes.

Bill was outnumbered. He howled, got up from the ground, and started to run.

He had lost.

Usually, at this moment, the wandering lion would proudly walk with its head held high, as if it was declaring the sovereignty of this territory. From now on, it belonged to him. It would not kill the previous lion king and only chase him out of the territory.

As for the previous lion king, he would never stay any longer. He would escape this place as quickly as possible.

However, today, the two wandering lions did not seem to be prepared to let Bill go.

They quickly caught up to Bill\!

A lion pounced on him, attracting his sharp teeth. As for the other lion, it suddenly bit his hind leg\!

Bill roared in pain and fell to the ground. He angrily and fearfully counterattacked with his sharp teeth\!

The first lion continued to attract his sharp teeth, and the second lion suddenly bit his spine\!

"Roar—"

Bill's roar was miserable and furious\!

He suddenly fell to the ground and could only twist his head to retaliate. He could not stand up anymore\!

The second lion took this opportunity to bite his soft abdomen again\!

Immediately, his skin and flesh were lacerated and he was dripping with blood\!

Bill's roar was miserable and desperate.

The female lions and young cubs not far away looked on in fear, but did not move.

Those two wandering lions were torturing and killing their husband or father in front of them\!

A sorrowful and terrified aura spread in the pride of the cold father.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and saw his mother trembling and his father in fear.

Bill's roar was still terrifying.

However, he could not stand up again.

The two wandering lions bit his spine, his hind legs, and his abdomen. Then, they ignored him and turned to walk towards the pride.

He could only wait for death slowly.

The female lions in Bill's pride started to panic.

The two wandering lions' mouths were full of blood as they walked towards them proudly and with a murderous aura.

Their goal was their seven young children.

"Roar—"

A female lion suddenly roared angrily and rushed up\!

For the sake of her children, she had to fight\!

The other lionesses immediately roared angrily and followed\!

After the two wandering lions defeated the lion king of the pride, they still had to defeat the seven lionesses who were protective of their cubs\!

Otherwise, all their efforts would be wasted and they could only leave.
