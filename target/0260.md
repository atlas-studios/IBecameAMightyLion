Chapter 260: Gunshots in the Night

"Roar —"

The young male black leopard on the tree roared arrogantly at Chu Xiaoye and the other two again.

At the same time, he raised his head and bulged the strong muscles on his shoulders, showing off in front of the Belita sisters.

"Honorable ladies, don't be afraid. With me here, those three little things can forget about hurting you\!"

However.

The leopard sisters felt that he was the baddie who would hurt them.

"Whoosh\!"

The two sisters jumped up and flew out, landing steadily on Chu Xiaoye's big tree and hiding at the top.

Belita lowered her head and roared at Chu Xiaoye.

He seemed to be saying, "Big fart, quickly chase these baddies away\!"

Belia also lowered her head and roared as she twisted her butt.

She seemed to be saying, "Young Master, you have to uphold justice for me. I'm yours\!"

The male black leopard was furious when it saw this scene. Its gaze at Chu Xiaoye was filled with jealousy and anger as it immediately roared.                                                       

At this moment, the black leopards surrounding the tree immediately jumped up and crawled towards the surrounding trees.

Both the tree and the tree were surrounded.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and roughly counted. Including the first male black leopard, there were about twenty black leopards here.

Black leopards were rare on the grassland and most lived alone.

Now, so many black leopards suddenly appeared here and were so united, like a tribe.

Chu Xiaoye thought of the black lions last night and felt that things were not simple.

This grassland would probably be even more chaotic.

If the members of the pride of the cold father had mostly recovered by tomorrow night, he decided to bring them on the road immediately. He could not delay any further.

No one knew what was happening on this grassland.

It was definitely not just a mutation.

Therefore, he had to leave early with the pride.

The young male black leopard was clearly blinded by jealousy and anger, or it relied on its numbers and weight to not take Chu Xiaoye and the other two seriously.

He actually jumped down from the tree, bared his fangs, and roared as he jumped over, pouncing ferociously at Chu Xiaoye.

However.

Before he could reach this tree, a figure flashed out of the tree with a whoosh. With a silver flash, it passed under him and landed on the big tree he was lying on previously.

"Pfft—"

Blood suddenly sprayed out\!

Just as this young male leopard landed on this tree, it fell down like a kite with a broken string. With a bang, it fell heavily to the ground and died on the spot\!

A terrifying wound appeared on his abdomen and almost broke open his entire abdomen\!

Blood and internal organs instantly flowed all over the ground\!

Catherine lay on another tree, her dark eyes deep and charming in the night. Her silver claws were flickering with a cold light.

At this moment.

Even Tilly felt a chill run down her spine when she looked at her cold eyes.

The Belita sisters were terrified.

This female cub was so ferocious and terrifying\!

The other black leopards surrounding him were shocked and furious. They bared their fangs and prepared to take revenge.

At this moment.

When they heard the noise, mixed fur, blue eyes, and the others quickly ran over.

Little Curly Tail also rushed over with the pride of the cold father and roared.

The black panthers that had been aggressive just now were shocked when they saw this scene, especially when they saw the six giant lions. They were terrified and no longer cared about revenge. They immediately fled\!

Little Curly Tail immediately jumped up the tree and swung his tail. With a bang, he slapped the body of a black leopard and actually broke its spine. It fell heavily to the ground and could not get up again.

The other black leopards did not stop and fled in panic.

Just as Little Curly Tail was about to chase after him, he was stopped by Chu Xiaoye.

A cornered enemy should not be chased\!

Who knew how many of their companions and traps were hidden in the night?

The situation on the grassland was unknown. They could not split up.

Little Curly Tail turned around and returned. He swung his tail and slapped the black leopard's head again. It actually cracked the black leopard's skull and blood flowed from its mouth and nose. It died instantly\!

The cold father stood at the side and trembled in fear. He looked fearfully at his youngest son and cursed in his heart.

He cursed the mothers of these two brothers\!

What the hell were these two monsters\!

They were still underage. One was dyed and the other was deformed. Furthermore, each of them was more perverted than the other\!

He even suspected if these two brats were his children\!

The black leopards left, but it did not mean that the danger had been resolved.

Chu Xiaoye instructed the mixed fur and the others to patrol the vicinity. They did not have to walk too far. They could just walk around the bushes and spend the night peacefully.

In the past, the lion's roar at night could scare away many enemies wandering around their territory.

Now, it was useless.

The changes in the grassland and their own mutations made many animals' confidence explode and their courage increase. They started to bravely want to change their positions in the food chain.

Everyone wanted to stand higher, look up at the sun and moon, look down at their feet, raise their hands to cover the sky, and raise their feet to shake the ground\!

Even herbivores were no exception.

Wasn't the herd of water buffaloes in the evening an example?

Unfortunately, most of the time, their hearts were higher than the sky and their lives were thinner than paper.

Chu Xiaoye had once thought of dominating the grassland and being a majestic lion king that would make all animals tremble in fear. But now, he only wanted to stay with his family, be happy, and live a peaceful life.

Only after experiencing life and death would they understand how precious life was.

Only after experiencing loss would they understand the happiness they had.

His lion life did not need to be dazzling or exciting. He only wanted to have a clear conscience and be worthy of them.

"Bang —"

A gunshot suddenly broke the silence of the night\!

Chu Xiaoye's body trembled. He raised his head and looked at the grassland outside the bushes.

The sound was not far.

A few kilometers away, in their territory\!

Was he a poacher?

Or were they the humans who had hunted him before?

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Suddenly, continuous gunshots sounded\!

They were getting closer and closer\!

At the same time, a strange roar came. It was like the voice of a beast, but he could not tell what animal it was.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared and summoned the six lions back.

They had to set off now\!

Set off immediately\!

Perhaps the other members could not understand what this sound represented, but he knew better than anyone that this sound represented death\!

No matter how big they were or how sharp their claws were, they could not withstand a single blow from those weapons.

His anxious roar shocked the members of the pride of the cold father.

After so many things, no one in this pride doubted his decision.

Even the cold father believed him from the bottom of his heart.

Therefore, everyone immediately took action and prepared to leave this troublesome place.

Maya hurriedly ran back to the camp and urged the two young cubs that were sleeping in the cave to come out.

The other prides immediately gathered and prepared to set off.

"Bang\!"

The gunshots were closer\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly saw pairs of scarlet eyes light up in the distant darkness\!

They were not the eyes of humans or animals.

He felt that he had seen it somewhere. Thinking carefully, he immediately thought of the rabbit he had encountered when he returned and the extremely strong monster he had encountered when he went to the village where humans lived.

He vaguely felt that things were not that simple.
