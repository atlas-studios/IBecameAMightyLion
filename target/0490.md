Chapter 490: Lion and Tiger Battle

"Vilis…"

Lori followed Vilis' gaze and looked at Chu Xiaoye. She was stunned. "Could the ferocious beast you're talking about be this bald lion? Oh\! Honorable Miss Vilis, are you sure you're not joking with me?"

Be it size, bloodline, or appearance, the two could not be compared.

The saber-toothed tiger was an ancient ferocious beast. It was strong, had a noble bloodline, was infamous, and had a mighty and domineering appearance. It was definitely not something this bald young lion could compare to.

Vilis looked at Chu Xiaoye and then at Annie beside her.

To be honest, she did not believe it either.

Annie's little face suddenly revealed anger, and she did not care that an outsider was present. "Vilis, the king is my benefactor and once saved my life. Without him, I would have died. I brought him here to let you help him shed his primitive nature and become a higher species. I'm not letting you use him as a tool and use his life to fight other beasts\!"

As soon as he said this, Lori's strange voice suddenly sounded exaggeratedly. "Yo\! Princess Annie\! You're the princess of our elven race. Why would you need a bald cub to save you? Wait, what did you just call him? King? Oh my god, esteemed princess, shouldn't your king be the supreme queen of our elven race? You actually called a furless beast king\! How absurd\!"

Annie did not care who he was. She said coldly, "I'm not talking to you. Stop talking\!"

Lori:"…"

She was indeed an impostor and did not have the qualities of a princess\! Tsk\!

Lori sneered with a disdainful expression and ignored her. She then looked eagerly at Vilis in front of her and did not hide her admiration. She smiled and said, "Vilis, you saw it too. The difference between the two is too big. There's no need to compare, right?"

Vilis was still as cold as ice.

She turned around beautifully and stuck the huge sword on her shoulder into the ground. Her two small hands held the wide sword hilt as she looked at him coldly and said, "I'm smaller than you and not as strong as you. I don't seem to be your match. However, Lord Lori, should we compete and see who is the strongest?"

Lori froze and immediately understood what she meant.

One's strength had nothing to do with one's size and appearance.

He was a little embarrassed. He smiled awkwardly and spread his hands. "Alright, Vilis. Since you don't want to give up, let this bald beast be prepared\! The feeling of being torn to pieces is not bearable."

As he said the last sentence, he looked mockingly at Chu Xiaoye and then at Annie.

Obviously, he did not have any respect for this fake Princess Annie and naturally did not fancy the lion she brought.

Lori walked towards the huge iron cage on the grass with her walking stick, preparing to let out the saber-toothed tiger to show her strength, vision, and sincerity.

Vilis placed her hands behind her back and waited.

The huge sword was inserted in the grass in front of her and was much taller than her. He did not know how she used it.

"Vilis, you might not have heard what I just said."

Seeing her attitude, Annie was even angrier. "I'll say it again. My king will not fight this beast\!"

Lori walked in front of the huge iron cage and turned around to mock, "Princess Annie, don't be afraid. It's better if your furless beast is bitten to death. I can give you a stronger ferocious beast."

He took out his key and started to open the lock.

Vilis turned to look at Annie and warned in a low voice, "Your Highness, from now on, your king is Her Majesty the Queen. If you say anything wrong next time, I can't save you. At that time, not only you, but also them will be blamed by Her Majesty the Queen."

"Is that so?"

Annie laughed coldly in anger. "Alright, let's leave. Pretend we never came."

She would never allow these elves to treat her king as a wild beast that only knew how to fight, let alone let his king risk his life to fight this saber-toothed tiger.

"King, let's go\!"

She turned around, rubbed Chu Xiaoye's neck, and walked in front.

At this moment, she gave up on the benefits the elves had promised.

Vilis turned around and looked at him. She narrowed her eyes and said coldly, "Your Highness, you will regret it. It's not worth it to do that for a beast."

Annie turned around and said with a serious expression, "Vilis, you're wrong. In my heart, he's not a beast. He's my benefactor, my friend, my king, my guardian, and my family. You'll never understand."

"Crack\!"

Right at this moment, the huge iron cage suddenly opened.

Lori stood beside the iron cage and sneered. "Your Highness, it's probably too late to leave now\! Since you've entered our City of Elves, you're Princess Annie of the City of Elves. Even if you're an impostor, you can't leave casually. Move aside and let us see how this furless animal you brought is qualified to be Miss Vilis' battle beast\!"

"Roar—"

The roar was deafening\!

The saber-toothed tiger slowly paced around and walked out of the huge iron cage. Its tiger-like eyes that were not angry and mighty stared at Chu Xiaoye with sharpness.

It knew that if it tore this bald lion to pieces today, it would be torn to pieces by this elven knight\!

It was willing to become the battle beast of this elven girl because this could improve its physique and strength. It could even let it be reborn, extend its life, become a spirit beast, and even change its form to enjoy the joy of various species.

Furthermore, this elf girl was so beautiful and noble, and her entire body emitting a tempting fragrance. Why not be ridden by her, live and die with her, and sleeping together with her?

Now, it had to perform well in front of this beautiful and cute new master\!

It passed by the elven knight and walked towards the bald lion.

It was not afraid that the other party would escape.

Because at such a short distance, if the other party exposed his back to him, he would die faster.

"Vilis\!"

Annie turned around with an anxious and angry expression, hoping that the elven girl could stop this terrifying saber-toothed tiger.

Vilis raised her hand and grabbed her huge sword. She said calmly, "Don't worry, Your Highness. I'll protect you."

Annie was furious. She turned to Chu Xiaoye and Catherine and said, "King, leave first. Leave the fairy city and don't return\!"

She paused and said guiltily, "King, I'm sorry… Annie lied to you."

With that, she suddenly took out the sharp knife from her waist. She took a few steps forward and blocked in front of the saber-toothed tiger, her eyes filled with determination.

Some favors could be returned with their lives\!
