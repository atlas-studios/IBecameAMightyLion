Chapter 357: Untitled

"Roar—"

A roar suddenly came from Chu Xiaoye's open mouth\!

Like a mountain torrent erupting, it shook the world and rumbled\!

The entire forest seemed to be trembling\!

It was as if a wave of air that was difficult to see with the naked eye surged outwards, shaking the surrounding vegetation and causing the air to buzz\!

The fur of the wolf pack that was preparing to attack around them were instantly sent flying by this roar. They were dizzy and seemed to be drunk. They swayed left and right and fell to the ground one after another. Blood flowed from their mouths and noses and they twisted their bodies in pain.

Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others, who were standing beside Chu Xiaoye, were only shocked by this deafening roar. They were not injured by any sound wave.

Chu Xiaoye himself felt that the airflow that had been restless for a long time finally excreted. It was as if he had been constipated for a week. When he could not take it anymore, it suddenly cleared up again. He felt so comfortable that his mouth and eyes were slanted and his entire body trembled.

However, this roar seemed to have exhausted most of his strength. His head was also buzzing.

After roaring, he suddenly felt exhausted and dispirited, as if he had just finished.

Looking at the wolf pack that had fallen to the ground around him and at their bleeding noses and painful expressions, Chu Xiaoye thought of the roar of the savage on the mountain previously.

Obviously, after he killed the savage completely, the savage's roar had been absorbed by him. Furthermore, it had been modified by the strange heat in his body to become his unique Lion's Roar.

This Lion's Roar seemed to be able to injure only the enemy and not his teammates according to his wishes.

However, it seemed to be more exhausting to use than the roar of the savage.

In his current state, he could at most roar one more time and definitely could not achieve the might of the first roar.

However, he was already very satisfied.

He did not need to attack. He could defeat the enemy with just his voice. Furthermore, this voice was not any other nonsense. It was his lion's roar.

If the Lion Roar Skill suddenly needed him to woof before it could be used, that would be embarrassing.

The members of the pride of the cold father, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur and the others were already stunned by the terrifying might of his roar.

Some white wolves were already bleeding from the corner of their mouths and died.

This lion roar clearly shattered their internal organs and caused them to suffer fatal internal injuries.

Some strong white wolves immediately struggled to get up after a short rest. They swayed and fled into the forest in fear.

The strong lead wolf suffered the least damage and was the first to stand up. However, it did not leave first. Instead, it waited for the other white wolves that could stand up to leave with them.

At this moment, it had long become a frightened bird. It was terrified by that roar and did not even dare to look at Chu Xiaoye again. It no longer had the prestige and composure it had when leading the wolf pack and charging over with a murderous aura.

Chu Xiaoye did not kill them all and watched helplessly as they fled in panic.

After all the living white wolves left, Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the corpse of a white wolf. He extended his claws and carefully cut open its stomach to check the internal organs inside.

Indeed, his stomach was dripping with blood and his internal organs had long been broken\!

The might of that lion roar just now was obvious\!

For the weak, it would shatter their internal organs; for the strong, it could disrupt their mental consciousness and cause their minds to be in chaos instantly. Their heads would ache and they would temporarily lose the strength to resist.

Be it a team battle or a one-on-one battle, this lion roar was definitely a killer weapon\!

Chu Xiaoye was rather excited. After some thought, he decided to change the name of this Lion Roar Technique to Lion King Roar—Grassland Lion King Roar\!

On the grassland over there, he had already become a true lion king. On this grassland and on the newly established territory, he would also become a true lion king\!

Only his roar was the true Lion King Roar\!

"Roar —"

He roared softly and realized that his throat had recovered to its original state. He no longer had to hold it in and be a mute. The haze in his heart was immediately swept away.

"Roar —"

At this moment, the little girl, who was holding his tail with her two little hands, was also learning his voice excitedly. She roared childishly, but it sounded comical.

Chu Xiaoye looked back at her. This little girl's eyes were curved, and she had bright eyes and white teeth. She seemed to be happy about his change.

If she had not grabbed his tail just now, under the threat of the wolf pack, he would have already rushed up and started swiping. He would not have held it in for so long and suddenly roared.

Furthermore, this Lion King's Roar was obtained because of this little girl.

If not for this little girl, the savage probably would not have appeared at all, nor would he have taken the initiative to provoke them, let alone fight him alone.

After he crossed the mountain, he would miss the opportunity and never see the savage again.

Therefore, this little girl was like her lucky star. She always brought him luck unconsciously.

Chu Xiaoye did not kick her again and let her little hand grab his tail. He growled and brought the team forward.

Little Curly Tail leaned over and beamed. He twisted his butt in a fawning manner and rubbed his head against his neck. He looked at him in anticipation, as if he was saying, "Brother, say it again."

The roar just now really stunned this kid.

Having lived for so long, he had never seen such combat skills.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at him sternly and told him to scram.

Little Curly Tail did not dare to dawdle around him and immediately scram. After walking to the side, he immediately opened his mouth and bulged his eyes, as if he was mimicking him and holding his breath.

Mei Mei deliberately pushed him with her head.

Little Curly Tail only glanced at him and did not say a word. He continued to open his mouth to hold his breath.

He planned to mimic his brother and keep quiet and pretend to be a mute all the way. At that time, he would suddenly erupt and shock his companions\!

Thinking of his excitement, he subconsciously opened his mouth and laughed, scaring Molly behind him.

The little girl also looked over strangely.

"It's a spirit\!"

These words popped up in Chu Xiaoye's heart again.

When they reached the foot of the mountain, Little Curly Tail finally could not hold it in anymore\!

He immediately stopped in his tracks, his excited face twitching. He slowly opened his mouth, his chest filled with air, and his eyes bulged\!

His entire body was tense. He raised his tail and prepared to roar\!

Seeing his state, everyone stopped in their tracks and held their breaths as they looked at him curiously and nervously.

"Pfft—"

In the end, he suddenly let out a fart. The aura gathered in his chest suddenly rushed out of his throat.

In the end, as the loud and ear-piercing fart sounded first, he could not help but roar with the voice. "Pfft…"

It sounded like his butt was farting and his mouth was farting.

The entire place was silent.
