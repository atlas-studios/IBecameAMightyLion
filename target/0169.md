Chapter 169: A Sentient Leopard\!

If he did not take revenge, he would not be a king\!

Chu Xiaoye cursed in his heart and continued to pee and mark the territory.

But soon, he could not pee.

It seemed that this project could not be completed in a day or two.

He decided to hand this difficult and glorious task to the Chino brothers after they recovered.

His farts were very smelly, but his urine did not have any pungent smell. If he used it to mark his territory, it might not be able to scare away wandering lions.

Those two fellows had pungent urine so he should let them mark the territory instead.

When they returned to the bushes, the Chino brothers, who were lying in the grass to rest, immediately stood up and lowered their heads, looking careful and respectful.

Doya crawled on the ground and did not even dare to raise her head.

The jackal couple were helping to clean the corpses of the lion and hyena with the vultures.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the Chino brothers and was satisfied with their brave battle just now.

The Chino brothers were extremely excited to be praised and became even more respectful and humble.

They finally relaxed.

It seemed that this young king had already acknowledged them and was willing to let them continue to stay here.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left.

He walked under a tall Baobab tree and raised his head, looking at this familiar and unfamiliar tree. A little longing surged in his heart.

He missed his mother, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei.

He wondered if they were okay now.

Had he finished eating the food on the Baobab tree?

Was the difficult dry season approaching its end?

He hoped that they could persevere and wait for his triumphant return.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was thinking about something, the bushes in front of him suddenly moved. Then, a slender little leopard walked out.

She faced him sideways, raised her chin, and stuck out her chest. Her tail swayed slightly as she walked calmly towards another patch of bushes, like a proud young lady.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. Wasn't this the little leopard that had caught the gazelle previously?

How dare she pace in front of a lion\!

Was she blind or stupid?

Chu Xiaoye allowed them to stay in his territory, but he would never allow them to provoke and ignore him.

He was the king of this territory\!

"Roar—"

He immediately roared and walked over.

When the little leopard heard his roar, not only did it not flee, it suddenly stopped in its tracks and turned around to look at him with sparkling eyes. Furthermore, it was even twisting its butt slightly\!

Idiot\!

She was definitely a retard\!

Chu Xiaoye decided to slap this retard and let her remember that the majestic, handsome animal in front of her was a lion\! A lion that ate meat\!

However, before he could get close, the strong male leopard suddenly jumped out from the grass at the side and protected the little leopard. It bared its fangs and looked at him fiercely.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and looked at him meaningfully.

They had seen each other by the river in the forest before. However, something very unpleasant had happened between them.

This male leopard's strength and sneak attack ability were the strongest he had seen so far.

Not only was he curious about the strength of this male leopard, but he was also very curious about why he was different from other leopards and actually lived with his wife and daughter.

This was definitely a different leopard.

"Roar —"

The male leopard did not look at him in the eye. He immediately turned around and roared at his daughter, telling her to leave quickly\!

Belia looked at him reproachfully, as if he had disturbed her when she was flirting with a handsome man, and reluctantly turned to leave.

Before leaving, she even deliberately turned around and stuck out her tongue at Chu Xiaoye. She wagged her tail and looked infatuated.

She seemed to be saying, "Handsome, let's meet again next time."

Chu Xiaoye had a blank expression.

This female leopard had become sentient?

This intelligence and expression were simply comparable to humans\!

"Whoosh\!"

The male leopard standing in front of him immediately turned around and left, hiding in the dense bushes.

This leopard was not simple either\!

Chu Xiaoye was bewildered. He felt that this father-daughter pair was not only not simple, but also terrifying.

Their intelligence was not inferior to that of the tiger marked by humans.

That tiger might have had human genes or other genes implanted into it by humans, which was why it was so smart and strong.

As for this leopard father and daughter pair?

Could it be that they were also test subjects of humans?

It was very possible\!

After all, the special mark engraved on the tiger's body clearly indicated that other than it, there were many test subjects.

The reason why he buried the tiger back then was because he was afraid that there was a problem with the tiger's flesh, blood and genes or that it had a tracking device on it. However, in the end, it was still discovered by humans.

Then, if this leopard father and daughter were also test subjects of humans, this animal paradise would not be peaceful for long.

He had to investigate the background of that father and daughter as soon as possible\!

Otherwise, even if he used all his strength to fight for this territory, he would not be able to live in peace.

How could he check?

Of course, he wanted to check their bodies to see if there were any special marks on them.

Then, how should he check their bodies?

He was very fast, but so was the other party.

Furthermore, this was a forest with trees and bushes everywhere.

This was the best place for leopards to hide and fight.

They had a natural advantage here.

At most, they would just climb the tree.

Now that he had no claws, he could only raise his neck and sigh at the tree.

Therefore, it was impossible to solve the problem with violence.

As for sneak attacks, there was no need to show off in front of an expert.

Their entire family was here, practising sneak attacks every day\!

Chu Xiaoye thought hard and suddenly thought of how the little leopard had stuck out its tongue at him and swung its butt at him.

Cough…

Could it be that he had to sell his body?

No, how could a dignified lion king degrade himself and do such an embarrassing thing?

No way\!

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and immediately rejected this humiliating thought.

After dark.

He quietly left the Chino brothers, the jackal couple, and Doya's vision. As if he was a thief, he walked sneakily into the depths of the bushes.

He was hungry and prepared to hunt and fill his stomach.

The leopard jumped around on the tree all day, going up and down. The skin on its body was definitely very strong and elastic. When he ate it, it would definitely be delicious and chewy.

He decided to hunt the little leopard.

The little leopard's skin was thin and tender, and it would definitely taste more delicious.

He stopped under the Baobab tree, raised his claws, and tidied the fur on his head. He raised his head and stuck out his chest. He stood there majestically, waiting for his prey to arrive.
