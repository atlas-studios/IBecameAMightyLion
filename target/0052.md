Chapter 52: Hero Among Women

A month later.

On the thick Baobab tree, three huge storage rooms had been built.

At the same time, it was filled with dried prey.

This made Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were preparing to sleep in the storage rooms, feel wronged and depressed.

They had been busy for so long and they thought they could sleep in them after they were built.

In the end, they were forcefully occupied by his brother and used to store those dry things.

They hated those things.

However, they could not change their brother's decision, nor did they dare to.

His brother's farts were becoming more and more smelly.

Two days ago.

Little Curly Tail had secretly eaten a few mouthfuls of those dry prey and felt that they were difficult to swallow. In his anger, he threw the prey that he had bitten a few times under the tree. In the end, he cried from his brother's stench.

He did not recover for three whole days. He would vomit whenever he ate.

After that day.

Little Curly Tail became completely obedient.

As long as his brother looked at him, no matter what he was doing at that time, he would immediately become obedient and docile like a little lamb.

As for Mei Mei, there was no need to mention her.

She would obey her brother unconditionally.

However, the two little fellows never understood why their brother worked so hard to build those three small houses but used them to store those dry prey.

They might not have noticed.

The grassland was already withered and there was not even a hint of green.

In the bushes where the lions lived, other than the green on the branches of the bushes, the ground had also changed color.

At the same time, the air was even more dry and hot.

The river water at the foot of the hill had already stopped flowing.

The crocodiles that always ambushed their prey under the water also exposed their backs.

A large group of hippos migrated up from the gradually drying downstream and forcefully occupied the crocodile's territory, making them their neighbor.

In the territory, the herd of water buffaloes that always came to the river to drink water had already left at some point.

The gnus also became rare.

The gazelles and zebras only had a few sparse teams left.

There was an additional herd of giraffes and elephants in the bushes.

Only they could eat the green leaves and sprouts on the branches of the bushes.

The leaves of the two Baobab trees had already withered completely. The branches at the top were also wrinkled and a little withered.

The pride changed from one meal a day to one meal every two days. Sometimes, they did not even catch any prey for three to four days.

Callie's stomach was already bulging.

Maya was pregnant too.

Every time they split the prey, Lars would snatch it crazily.

He grew larger and stronger, and his appetite became more and more astonishing.

However, he neither hunted nor guarded the territory.

For some reason, during this period of time, the lion, the cold father, no longer bothered with him. Even when he was enjoying his prey, he would roar and chase his mother and the other lionesses away, taking the best share for himself.

Other than the cold father, he ate the most every time.

Now, even his mother, the lioness with a broken tail, no longer looked at him with the gentleness and love she had previously. She even looked a little cold.

Every time Chu Xiaoye saw Lars's arrogant manner of snatching food, he wanted to slap him.

However, he did not attack.

He knew that his brother's tragedy was approaching.

When the cold father stopped caring about him and started to let him do whatever he wanted, when he was fearless and angered all the female lions for the lack of food, his tragedy was destined.

When that day arrived, even her mother would not have any mercy on him\!

The cold father's move was called letting the enemy off in order to catch him later.

When all the female lions started to hate this eldest son who fought for food but was useless to the pride, it would be time for him to make a move.

Unfortunately, Lars did not know.

He only knew that his body had become stronger and his strength had increased. Even his roar seemed to be able to compete with his father's\!

He was immersed in the beautiful dream that he was about to become a king that the lionesses and his father were afraid of.

Look.

His father did not dare to hit him again. The female lions dodged in fright when he roared. Even the always arrogant Little Curly Tail turned around and left when he saw him.

The most powerful younger brother always hid on the tree and secretly looked at his majestic figure. He should be envious, jealous, and hateful\!

Lars was very pleased.

He decided to show his might as a lion in front of his three brothers and sisters in advance and make them bow down to him. They would be of use to him in the future\!

On this day.

The three female lions went out to hunt while the lion, the cold father, went to patrol the territory.

Due to the heat, the pregnant Callie and Maya stayed in the shade of the bushes to rest.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the grass and thought about the water.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were lying not far away from him and sleeping soundly.

Last night, the two little fellows followed him to the bushes at the back to learn how to hunt. They worked all night and only returned at dawn.

As for the foreign lioness, Catherine, she was nowhere to be seen. No one knew where she went.

The poisonous bee army in the bushes had all moved away from this place a few days ago. They should not be able to tolerate the heat here.

Chu Xiaoye brought the huge beehive back and placed it in the storage room.

There was still a lot of honey in the beehive. It could be smeared on the surface of the food to preserve the food and also be used for consumption.

Although the smell was a little strange for lions, it was still usable.

"Roar—"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was thinking about the problem, he suddenly heard a roar\!

Lars, who had been lying in the shadow of the bushes, came in front of him and stared at him fiercely, asking him to move.

The sun moved.

Chu Xiaoye's place was still dark, and Lars was already exposed to the sun.

However, there were also many cool places elsewhere.

It seemed that this fellow wanted to restore his prestige as the eldest brother.

After all, he had indeed grown up and become stronger.

He wanted to recover his lost dignity and confidence in front of his younger brother.

This was understandable.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at him with a calm gaze. He was not angry at all. Instead, he pitied him a little.

Let him be confident for once.

Otherwise, when he went out to wander in the future, how could he survive without confidence?

Perhaps, he would not even dare to hunt prey.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and quietly walked to another shade.

Little Curly Tail, who was woken up by Lars' roar, looked suspiciously at his brother and the more arrogant and pleased Lars.

Mei Mei also woke up.

She did not quite understand.

Although Brother Lars was very strong, she believed that her brother only needed a slap to make him fall to the ground. He did not even need to use his full strength.

However, why did his brother choose to tolerate it?

"Roar—"

Just as she was feeling puzzled, Lars suddenly walked in front of her again, bared his fangs, and roared at her fiercely, asking her to get up and help him lick the fur on his body.

Mei Mei was stunned for a moment before she stood up.

Lars was very pleased. He continued to bare his fangs and scare this timid sister fiercely. Then, he turned around and pointed his butt at her, telling her to lick it quickly.

However, in the next second, he suddenly jumped up\!

"Whoosh\!"

Mei Mei suddenly grabbed his butt with her claws. Her sharp claws pierced into his flesh and she pulled fiercely, tearing off a layer of his flesh and fur\!

"Roar—"

Lars immediately let out a miserable scream in pain. He suddenly roared and turned around, showing his sharp fangs, preparing to bite\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Mei Mei's sharp claws quickly and mercilessly scratched his face again\!

Three times in a row, each time so deep that bones could be seen\!

After scratching it, Mei Mei turned around and ran before he could react. She jumped and landed lightly on the thick tree trunk of the Baobab tree. With a whoosh, she agilely climbed up.

"Roar—"

Lars's miserable roar only sounded at this moment\!

His face was covered in blood and he rolled on the ground in pain. His furious roars started to tremble and he cried.

Little Curly Tail lay in the grass at the side, his mouth twitching as he looked at his poor brother with lingering fear.

No wonder his brother had given in to him. He was a fool.

Who would care about a fool?

Except for this lioness cub that often followed her brother and secretly learned from him.

Now, even he did not dare to provoke this female cub easily.

The current female cub was no longer the timid and incompetent lioness that anyone could bully in the past\!

She had bitten a hyena to death, chased a lone wolf, killed a wild boar, and even competed with a little leopard in climbing trees\!

How ferocious\! How valiant\!

She was simply the hero of women and the overlord of lionesses\!

Poor stupid brother. Of all the people you could provoke, you had to provoke her\!

Even if you provoke me, it's fine.

— I will at most bite off your balls and turn you into a dead eunuch.
