Chapter 112: Savage Killer

The cold father was furious\!

He roared angrily and rushed into the bushes with a murderous aura.

He thought that it was the work of the Seno brothers' pride next door.

The female lions were sad and angry. They immediately followed behind him with a common enemy and prepared to take revenge on the Seno brothers' pride.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the bloody head of the lioness with a broken tail and then at the distance between here and the pride's camp.

To be able to silently kill a battle-hardened lioness with one move and quickly drag her away, this was definitely not done by the Seno brothers' pride\!

He might be able to guess who it was.

However, was the strength of that jungle beast really that terrifying?

Seeing the pride walk into the bushes angrily, he immediately followed with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

The cold father's roar echoed in the entire forest.

However, the Seno brothers' pride did not respond.

When they reached the border of the Seno brothers' pride, they suddenly realized that two corpses were lying in the grass.

Beside the corpse, the heads of the two female lions were still left.

They were the female lions of the Seno brothers' pride\!

The cold father's steps immediately froze as he looked at the corpses of the two female lions in bewilderment.

Could it be that Seno was so hungry that he killed them himself?

He hesitated for a moment, but still crossed the border with the female lions and walked towards the camp of the Seno brothers' pride.

He had to go and understand.

The camp of the Seno brothers' pride was quiet and did not move.

When they arrived at the camp, they suddenly realized that in the grass not far away, a head with a lush mane was vaguely visible\!

That was Seno\!

Could Seno be hiding there to ambush invaders like them?

The cold father immediately roared angrily, indicating that he had already discovered him. If you have the ability, come out. Don't be sneaky\!

However, Seno did not move.

The cold father and the lionesses stopped in place, seemingly not daring to go forward. They were afraid that this lion king would throw caution to the wind and pounce on invaders like them\!

Chu Xiaoye felt that something was wrong and hurriedly walked over.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately followed behind him.

When he came close to the grass, Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled and he stood there in a daze.

This once majestic lion king had its stomach cut open and its internal organs eaten. At this moment, it was lying here miserably and had become a corpse.

Flies flew everywhere and maggots squirmed.

His eyes were wide with fear and unwillingness. He clearly died with a grievance.

The cold father walked over with the three female lions and looked blankly at his former neighbor and enemy.

When the female lions saw this scene, they trembled in fear.

What was it that could kill an adult lion in its prime?

Chu Xiaoye walked close to the lion king's corpse and observed the wounds on his body.

There were no bites on his neck and no wounds on his spine.

Although his abdomen was cut and his internal organs were eaten clean, this was not the first place that killed him.

As long as he had the slightest ability to resist, he would never let the enemy bite his abdomen.

In other words, the enemy only started to bite his abdomen after killing him completely.

Then, there were no other obvious wounds on his body. How did he die?

Chu Xiaoye leaned in front of his head and examined it carefully.

His eyes were bloodshot and blood flowed from his ears.

On his head, a patch of fur sank slightly. If one did not observe carefully, it was difficult to discover.

Chu Xiaoye reached out with his claws and pressed on the collapsed place. His heart trembled.

The lion king's skull was broken\!

What strength was it that could shatter this lion king's head and make him unguarded, killing him in one move?

Chu Xiaoye's claws trembled.

He believed that his current strength was already extremely strong and could slap away the teeth of an adult lion with one claw. However, if he were to compare it with this strength, he was still far from it\!

If it was really done by that jungle beast, it was definitely not an ordinary tiger\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of that night. Its cold gaze and illogical demeanor resembled some humans very much\!

The death of the lioness with a broken tail was too strange.

Could it be that the humans who brought it here had done something to its body?

Otherwise, no matter how strong a tiger was, it would never be able to slap a mature lion to death easily.

Furthermore, it did not seem to be just for food. It seemed to be deliberately killing.

Chu Xiaoye was uneasy.

This was originally a season that all animals could not survive. But now, there were monsters that should not have appeared on the grassland.

What were those humans who did not know the difficulty of survival trying to do?

Could it be that it was just for entertainment and to watch a bloody battle and a good show of looking down on lives?

Chu Xiaoye looked up at his pride.

Another member was missing.

It was extremely difficult to strengthen the pride.

Now, it was probably an extravagant hope to survive.

His heart was filled with anger.

Suddenly, he looked at the three female lions.

Where was Maya?

Maya should still be guarding the children in the camp\!

At this moment, she was alone\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. He suddenly thought of something terrifying and hurriedly cried out before running back to the camp\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were stunned for a moment before they hurriedly followed behind him.

Catherine, who was standing not far away, immediately followed.

Chu Xiaoye's heart was filled with fear. He ran back at his fastest speed and soon left the three of them behind.

When he ran back to the camp, he saw Maya lying in front of a bush feeding the two cubs. Not far behind her, a colorful figure was using the cover of the grass to crawl on the ground and quietly approach\!

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily. All the blood in his body surged, and his limbs were hot. His fur stood on end as he shot out like a bolt of lightning\!

When Maya saw him running over ferociously, she was shocked\!

At this moment, the colorful figure that was quietly approaching her suddenly turned around and quickly disappeared into the dense grass.

Chu Xiaoye could clearly see its cold and cold eyes and its thick yellow and white tail\!

He suddenly jumped up and landed in front of Maya. With a whoosh, he jumped out of the grass beside her\!

Maya bared her fangs and was about to pounce on him when she saw that he had already jumped over.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in the dense grass, but he could no longer see the cold figure.

Its faint scent lingered in the grass.

If he did not smell it carefully, it would be difficult to discover.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine rushed over and looked at him in confusion.

They did not know what was happening.

Maya, who was terrified, was still baring her fangs and roaring.

She did not see the attacker and thought that Chu Xiaoye was going to hurt her child.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and returned to the camp. He looked at her and the two young cubs in her arms, his heart still beating violently.

Thinking of the crisis just now and the tragic death of the lioness with a broken tail, a cold light flashed in his eyes.

They could not wait for death\!
