Chapter 95: Mighty Lion\!

The battle ended.

Peace returned to the camp.

The entire process and outcome were so fast that the cold father found it unbelievable.

He raised his head and looked at the other two wandering lions.

The two wandering lions were already lying in a pool of blood and had no chance to stand up.

The female lions and young cubs stood in front of them, still exuding a murderous aura.

The cold father retracted his gaze in a daze and looked at the female cub beside him.

He suddenly felt that the dignity and face of an adult lion had been completely lost by these three wandering lions tonight\!

In the beginning, when he saw the three wandering lions charging over aggressively, he was about to escape.

Even when he finally summoned his courage to fight, he did not have any hope.

He only hoped that he could be like the Zeno lions, who shared a common enemy and scare the three wandering lions, making them retreat in the face of adversity.

However, he never would have thought that these three fellows would be so fragile that they would all die in less than a moment\!

Furthermore, they died under the claws of the lionesses and young cubs\!

Would they be able to face the majestic mane on their necks, their strong bodies, and their sharp fangs?

They were not fit to be lions\!

Look at his cold father, he was all alone…

Looking at the wandering lion's intestines all over the ground and the calm expression of the female cub, the cold father could not help but tremble and stop fantasizing.

Were young cubs so full of energy that they developed so crazily nowadays?

He had once seen an adult lion. Not to mention mustering his courage to fight, even a glance at it would make him tremble in fear.

The young lions nowadays…

Regardless, the cold father was in a good mood tonight.

The pride worked together and defeated three wandering lions and killed them.

This battle result was the greatest honor of his life as a lion.

If the other wandering lions in the vicinity knew, who would dare to provoke them in the future?

Therefore, he decided to drag the corpses of the three wandering lions up the hill and placed them in the most obvious position so that those fellows with ill intentions could see them and deter them\!

He would do it when he thought about it.

He immediately took action.

Under normal circumstances, lions would not eat the corpses of their own kind unless they were extremely hungry.

Of course, some cruel lions especially liked to show their ferocity by eating the corpses of their own species to achieve the goal of scaring other species.

The cold father was not interested in the corpses of these guys. When he ate them, he felt like he was eating himself.

On this grassland, the fate of lions was extremely similar.

He could not swallow it.

The cold father bit the neck of the wandering lion in front of him and tried to move it, but he realized that he could not move it.

The battle just now had already exhausted quite a bit of his energy.

He was hot and tired.

Furthermore, this wandering lion weighed at least 180 kilograms. It was really heavy.

He opened his mouth and panted. Just as he was about to give up, he saw the female cub in front of him extend its claws again and start to dig the stomach of this wandering lion.

With a few random strokes, she dug out all the internal organs in the stomach of this wandering lion.

Her face was still calm and there was no fear in her eyes.

The cold father looked at her in fear. Just as he was feeling his stomach tremble and his internal organs tremble, the little lioness bit the wandering lion's thigh again and dragged it up the hill.

"..."

The cold father was stunned.

Even though this wandering lion's internal organs were hollowed out, it still weighed more than 100 kilograms, several times that of this female cub. But she actually… she actually…

She actually dragged him away\!

The cold father stood in place, staring blankly. He felt that his little brain was not enough for him to use and was blank.

Was this still a fucking cub?

Catherine bit the wandering lion's thigh and used all her strength to drag it towards the hill not far away, leaving a long trail of blood on the grass.

She would not let this lion king look down on her\!

This stupid lion king was his father\!

She had to perform well\!

At this moment, not only was the cold father looking at her in fear, but the five female lions were also staring at her with their mouths open in shock.

The expressions on Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail's faces were even more exaggerated.

Could this female cub be a natural strongman?

As for Chu Xiaoye.

The corner of his mouth twitched. He felt that the world had really changed.

Little Curly Tail's tail grew longer and Mei Mei's eyes turned blue. As for this lioness cub, it turned into a strong lioness\!

Was the world going to be in chaos?

Catherine did not know what the pride was thinking of her.

She did not sense anything wrong.

She felt very tired and strained.

However, she had to hold on.

Because he was looking at her.

He was so powerful, so awesome, and so outstanding that he was as dazzling as the moon in the night.

She must not embarrass herself in front of him\!

She wanted him to know that she, Catherine, was also very brave and useful\!

Thinking of his charming figure and eyes, and thinking that he might look at her in a different light, she suddenly felt full of strength and immediately accelerated\!

"Roar—"

She heard the lion king roar.

This should be encouraging and praising her.

His father was praising her.

Hehe.

"Roar—"

This time, not only did the Lion King roar, he suddenly ran over.

The female lions also ran over\!

Catherine was extremely excited and started dragging it even harder.

The pride finally accepted her\!

His father, mother, and the other lionesses all took the initiative to come and praise her\!

She was so nervous\!

Would he come too?

If he came over and rubbed her head to show his appreciation, she would faint from happiness\!

She narrowed her eyes and was drunk. She felt like she was floating.

"Bang\!"

Right at this moment, her body suddenly collided with a tree.

Why were there trees here?

She opened her mouth and raised her head, looking back in confusion.

Behind her was a familiar Baobab tree.

Every night, he would climb up the tree to sleep.

She turned around and looked around.

This was the camp of the pride…

No one knew when she suddenly turned around and dragged the corpse of the wandering lion to the camp.

Looking at the blood all over the grass in the camp, at the lion king's furious gaze and the stunned expressions of the female lions, Catherine :"…"

"Roar—"

The cold father roared at her and told her to drag the corpse away quickly\!

This little fool\!

In the beginning, she had been dragging it well. Why did she suddenly tilt and turn around, dragging the corpse to the pride camp?

Indeed, she had yet to grow up.

Her brain had yet to develop completely\!

Catherine was embarrassed and ashamed. She felt extremely embarrassed and hurriedly bit the corpse and dragged it away.

Oh no, he was going to laugh at her so much.

She raised her head in frustration and secretly looked at that figure, only to see that he was not looking at her at all but dragging the corpse of another lion.

On the other hand, that little Curly Tail with a monkey tail was wagging its tail and jumping around, letting out mocking cries.

Hmph\!

What are you laughing at?

You're a younger brother\! You'll always be a younger brother\!

Catherine muttered in her heart.
