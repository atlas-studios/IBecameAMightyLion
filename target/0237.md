Chapter 237: Recruiting Lion Talents

The snowstorm arrived.

The cold wind howled and snowflakes fell.

Before long, the entire hole was covered.

Although they were hiding in the deep cave, they could still hear the roar of the storm from above.

He wondered how long such weather would last.

The horizontal ice cave was dug much wider.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the innermost area and prepared to sleep comfortably.

The past few days of running around had exhausted him.

Catherine lay beside him and looked at him quietly.

However, Tilly walked over and squeezed between them, blocking her vision. She faced her and smiled at her, as if she wanted to be close to her.

Catherine's gaze turned cold. She suddenly flicked her silver claw and quietly put it away again. She turned her head and did not look at her, but looked elsewhere.

Tilly did not seem to sense her disgust and coldness. She moved forward and placed her head on her head. She rubbed it a few times and let out a whimper.

She seemed to be saying, "Sister, follow me in the future, okay?"

Catherine turned around and aimed her butt at her face, clearly expressing her intentions.

Tilly was not angry at all. Instead, she extended her claws and deliberately raised her tail, but Catherine slapped her face with her tail.

Catherine stood up and walked forward until she reached the bottom of the hole. Then, she stopped and lay down.

Tilly refused to yield and stood up to walk over.

She had to get this powerful lioness cub full of personality\!

She did not believe that with her status and charm, she could not compare to that bad fellow who peed in public, had no manners, and especially liked to fart\!

That bad fellow was not qualified to have such an outstanding lioness cub\!

"Roar\!"

She walked in front of Catherine and lay down, looking at her with watery eyes, indicating that as long as you follow me, you can stay in the snow mountain in the future and eat and drink well. You can have any territory you want and as many strong lions as you want.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine raised her claws and sprinkled a snowflake on her face, staring at her coldly.

She stood up and flicked her silver claws, filled with killing intent\!

Tilly shook her head and shook off the snowflakes on it. Then, she lowered her head and looked at her beautiful silver claws. She could not help but extend her claws to touch them to show that she liked them very much.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine suddenly raised her claws and scratched her face viciously\!

She was merciless\!

Tilly hurriedly retreated and dodged away narrowly. She widened her eyes and looked at her with a wronged expression. "Sister, do I have a grudge against you? Am I not beautiful? Don't I have charm? Why do you dislike me so much? You actually want to disfigure me so that I'll be sad. Wu…"

Catherine looked at her coldly and her two silver claws popped out.

Tilly curled her lips and did not dare to provoke her again. She could only turn around in frustration and stay away from her for the time being.

The female cub had a violent temper and a stubborn personality. She was helpless.

Didn't all the lions on the grassland want to stay in the snow mountain?

Right\!

Her eyes suddenly lit up as she looked at the bad guy sleeping on the ground at the innermost corner.

Since the female cub followed him wholeheartedly, as long as he stayed, the female cub would naturally stay too.

It would be easy to deal with him.

Almost every lion on the grassland was extremely excited when they came here. When they saw the female lions on their snow mountain, they drooled and wanted to kneel and lick them.

As long as she slightly released her charm or promised to give him a few female lions, he would definitely stay and thank her profusely. She would not be able to chase him away\!

At the thought of this, Tilly immediately became happy.

She quickly walked in front of that fellow, extended her claws, and patted his head to wake him up.

Chu Xiaoye opened his eyes and stared blankly at her shining crystal whisker.

Tilly was secretly happy. This kid was indeed horny.

She lowered her eyes and pretended to be shy. She reached out and rubbed his head gently. Just as she was about to pinch her throat and whimper, he suddenly raised his claws and slapped her head with a bang\!

Tilly was caught off guard. Her head tilted and she was slapped to the ground.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye stared at her sleepily and told her to scram\!

Tilly got up from the ground and glared at him angrily. She wanted to pounce on him and bite him a few times, but she thought of her plan to take in lion talents and could only tolerate it. She glanced at him angrily with her watery eyes and turned around, facing him with her butt. She twisted it a few times and swung her tail around, letting out a roar.

In the end, just as she let out a roar, Chu Xiaoye slapped her butt and let out a roar of disdain and anger.

"Take your butt away\! It's so smelly\! This King wants to sleep\!"

Chu Xiaoye covered his nose with his claws and turned around, turning his head inside and facing the wall.

Tilly's entire body trembled in anger. Her two golden claws popped out with a whoosh, and two flames almost spewed out of her light blue eyes.

This bastard\!

This bastard\!\!\!

Suddenly, she felt a chill behind her.

She turned around and saw that the cold female cub had already arrived behind her at some point in time. Its body was slightly arched and its two silver claws were revealed. It was looking at her coldly, as if it was preparing to pounce on her and risk its life at any time.

The corner of Tilly's mouth twitched a few times. She could only put away her golden claws and look fiercely at the bastard who was pointing his butt at her. Then, she turned around and left. She walked to the entrance of the cave and lay down. She was so angry that her eyes rolled back and she was panting.

Seeing that she had walked far, Catherine put away her claws and walked behind Chu Xiaoye. She lay there and looked at his butt gently.

Tilly was lying under the hole and watching this scene. She was furious and aggrieved.

These two fellows who smelled like milk did not know what the snow mountain represented. They did not know what her snow-white and noble fur represented.

They actually dared to reject her\!

Damn it\!

Especially that smelly fart king. He actually dared to dislike her. Didn't he know that he was the one who should be disliked the most?

Look at the fur on his body. It was dirty, gray, and yellow. There was even a tuft of golden fur mixed on it. He was clearly dyed deliberately like a non-mainstream and liked to pee in public. His farts were smelly and black. He was the biggest wonder she had seen since she was born\!

"Ugh —"

Her stomach churned at the thought of his invincible smelly fart.

Why should such a smelly fart king dislike her? What right did he have to dislike her?

It was too much\!

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She decided to teach him a lesson and let him know whose territory this was, who was the superior lion and who was the inferior lion that should be despised the most\!

She closed her eyes and started to sleep.

She decided to teach him a lesson when she woke up.

Two hours later.

She opened her eyes and pricked up her ears to listen to the sounds outside. It was still snowing heavily, like a ferocious beast traveling and could not get out.

She raised her golden claw and looked at it carefully, then looked up at the smelly fart king.

Then, she walked over and squeezed between Catherine and the smelly fart king again. She lay there and continued to close her eyes to sleep.

Yes, it was much warmer here.
