Chapter 441: Untitled

"Roar —"

The jaguar let out a miserable scream again. Then, its body stiffened and its eyes widened. It was dead\!

The jaguar died with a grievance and was unwilling to accept this.

With her strength, if she had known that this would happen, even if she could not escape, she could still kill a few with her life. It was better than dying miserably in humiliation like now.

Alisa was rather unhappy with Chu Xiaoye's act of kill stealing. She suddenly used her sharp claws and cut off the jaguar's neck. Blood sprayed on her face and she looked rather ferocious.

No one was a fool. She, Alisa, was the true terminator of this jaguar.

This was only the beginning.

Next, she would let these members know step by step that she, Alisa, was indispensable in this team\!

"Hmph\! Just wait\!"

Alisa put away her sharp claws and glanced coldly at Chu Xiaoye. Then, she turned around and left.

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw was still stuck in the leopard's head. He waited patiently for a while and was a little disappointed to see that no skills were absorbed.

The wild dogs on the ground had already been killed by the pride.

The strong smell of blood floated in the air. Even the carnivorous birds in the sky were attracted and started to circle above their heads, calling for friends.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and continued forward with the pride.

The trees on the grassland were no longer as dense and sparse as those on the mountain. They mixed with all sorts of bushes and formed bushes. They looked at each other through the grass and extended into the distance.

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye finally brought the pride out of the forest and arrived at the vast grassland.

Looking around, the grass was lush.

Because it was dusk, all sorts of herbivores formed groups and walked towards the river that crossed the grassland in succession, preparing to drink water.

There were zebras, gazelles, black antelopes, gnus, and wild buffaloes.

Just by standing here, he could see so many animals. From this, it could be seen how abundant the food and resources were on this beautiful grassland. To a group of homeless and wandering lions, this was heaven\!

Everyone was extremely excited.

Even the cold father, who always cared about his image, beamed and wagged his tail as he ran around.

Chu Xiaoye could not restrain the excitement in his heart. He immediately brought the pride and followed behind the herbivores, walking towards the distant river, preparing to see the environment here.

The current them actually had nothing to be picky about. Furthermore, they did not need to be picky about the environment here. They could feed themselves by just looking for a territory.

However, Chu Xiaoye still planned to find territory near the river. Furthermore, there had to be a forest on the territory. There had to be some tall trees in the forest.

This would make him feel safer.

The fiery red sun fell from the distant horizon.

Although it was already dark, Chu Xiaoye still rushed forward with the pride.

At this moment, all the members of the pride did not feel sleepy at all. Their hearts were filled with longing and anticipation for the new territory. They were so excited that they could not calm down.

The little girl riding on the big black bear clearly sensed the atmosphere. Just as she was about to sing a ballad, she suddenly remembered that it was nighttime and danger was everywhere. She could not expose herself.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the roar of a lion suddenly came from the grassland in front of him.

Then, the roars of the other lions rose and fell, spreading far in the quiet night.

This was a warning to the nearby lions and enemies. That was their territory. Whoever dared to step in would definitely be attacked and killed mercilessly by them.

From the sound, there were many lions in this pride. There were at least six lions, and they were all adult lions. Their strength could not be underestimated.

That territory happened to be not far from the river.

If Chu Xiaoye brought the pride over, he had to pass through that territory.

Of course, they could still circle around from the side. However, in this way, they would probably have to walk until tomorrow morning. Furthermore, who could guarantee that there were no other prides stationed on the grassland that they circled around?

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye did not stop and continued to walk towards the place where the lions roared with the pride.

They were traveling through this territory and did not covet it.

Although there were also bushes in this territory, they were too small. Compared to other bushes, they were not just a little inferior. Chu Xiaoye was not interested at all.

A pungent smell came from the lush grass.

This was the mark the lion left at the border and used it to warn those thieves and thieves not to step in.

Chu Xiaoye admitted that he was neither a thief nor a challenger. Therefore, he stepped into this territory without hesitation.

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and ran around excitedly. He wanted to roar provocatively and let the lions discover invaders quickly.

The scream of a zebra came from the grassland not far away.

A group of female lions were hunting.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the pride close, the female lions reacted and immediately jumped up in fright. They turned around and ran, roaring angrily as they fled.

The few lions that were lying in the camp roaring immediately got up and ran over with a murderous aura.

Little Curly Tail was afraid that the other party would be terrified the moment they met. Therefore, he immediately ran in front of the zebra that had yet to stop breathing. He swung his tail and wrapped it around the zebra's neck, dragging it into the pride and taking it for himself.

Soon, six lions rushed over with more than ten female lions.

After charging close, they stopped and lined up, baring their fangs. They let out low and fierce roars, as if they were questioning something.

If Chu Xiaoye only had one or two lions, the other party would never hesitate like this and would have long pounced on them to kill.

Obviously, Chu Xiaoye's team made this pride feel threatened. Even if they had six strong adult lions, they did not dare to fight easily.

Was he going to be polite before resorting to force?

Facing the questioning of this pride, Chu Xiaoye said honestly, "We're just passing by. We don't have any improper thoughts about your territory and the female lions."

Some battles could be avoided if possible. Before seeing a suitable territory, preserving strength was the most important.

Furthermore, these six lions were not ordinary lions.

When they first appeared, Chu Xiaoye clearly saw a crystal whisker light up at each of their mouths.

Furthermore, no true lion king was found among these six lions.

Chu Xiaoye decided to leave immediately.

Something seemed wrong.

Suddenly\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The ground seemed to be trembling\!

It was as if something terrifying was approaching from the side\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and narrowed his eyes. His eyes flickered with a golden light that pierced through the dark night and looked into the distance.

A huge beast that was like an ostrich was running over with two strong legs\!
