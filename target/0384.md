Chapter 384: Untitled

After dark.

The vultures in the sky dispersed one after another.

The jackals and wandering lions on the ground also fled in fear.

The death of the hyenas made these predators, who had been at the border of life and death for many years, understand that this sumptuous meal was not delicious.

The purpose of eating was to survive.

If they ate and then died, what was the point?

The atmosphere in the bushes was strange.

The members of the pride were all stunned in place, looking at the grassland in a daze.

Even the playful Little Curly Tail was squatting there motionless.

At this moment, even if Chu Xiaoye ordered them to dig out the water buffaloes and eat them, they did not dare to go.

They already had a fear of water buffaloes.

The little girl, who was sitting on the tree, was still eating the numb and fragrant beef jerky with relish, as if she was not afraid of the water buffaloes at all.

Furthermore, she even blinked her big eyes and lectured the members of the pride under the tree in a childish voice, "Do you see that? This is the outcome of not listening to the king's orders. If the king says that you can eat it, you can eat it. If the king says that you can't eat it, you definitely can't eat it. Everyone must listen to the king in the future."

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her and saw that the little girl was smiling sweetly at him with a fawning expression.

Little Curly Tail suddenly leaned over, twisted his butt, and crawled. As if he was begging for forgiveness, he moved to his side, wagged his tail, and rubbed his body fawningly.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and rolled his eyes at him. He was still merciless and slapped him away.

Little Curly Tail fell to the ground and immediately got up. He bared his fangs at the cold father and growled, as if he was saying, "Do you see that? Brother is the smartest here\! Come over and apologize to Brother\!"

The muscles on the cold father's face twitched and he panted heavily.

Although he was angry, he could not help but be impressed by his unfilial son's intelligence.

Looking at the hyenas' corpses on the grass and thinking of the strange and terrifying scene just now, he still felt a chill run down his spine and lingering fear.

If the king of this pride was still him, he would never be willing to throw away those prey. He might have already let the pride eat continuously.

Then, the ones who died would not be the hyenas outside, but his pride.

Fortunatelyâ€¦ fortunately.

Although he was still unwilling to give up the throne, he was completely convinced of this unfilial son now.

Only this unfilial son could continue to reproduce and strengthen this pride.

Be it strength or intelligence, he admitted that he was far inferior.

At this moment, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jiela sisters, and the female lions also respected and admired this young king more.

No one would have thought that those strong water buffaloes would actually be poisonous.

They had eaten beef for so many years and always thought that this prey was the safest. However, today, this young king taught them a good lesson.

The world was changing, the grassland was changing, they were changing, and so was their prey.

Unfortunately, they could not see these changes clearly.

Until now, they still could not understand why they could not eat a good water buffalo. Furthermore, they had just eaten beef in the morning. Why were they fine?

On the tree, the human girl was still eating the beef jerky with relish.

What was wrong?

They really could not understand.

Therefore, they admired and respected this young king even more.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was thinking about something, he suddenly felt a chill on his butt. He turned around and saw Mei Mei standing behind him. She narrowed her eyes and looked at him with admiration and obsession, as if she was saying, "Brother is so powerful."

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his hind leg and kicked her face, causing her to fall to the ground.

I told you long ago not to lick\!

Beside him, Little Curly Tail immediately jumped and gloated. He winked and let out a strange laugh.

Brother finally hit Mei Mei\! I'm not alone\!

The night grew darker.

A round moon rose into the sky.

The smell of blood from the water buffaloes and the hyenas drifted away with the night wind.

In the distant night, many dark and greedy eyes suddenly appeared.

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and immediately growled. He brought all the members of the pride out of the bushes and walked towards the hyenas' corpses.

The three warthogs worked hard again to dig holes.

The members of the pride also raised their claws and helped dig the soil.

Soon, another big and deep pit was dug beside the water buffalo.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others over and threw the hyena corpses into the pit.

Before this, he reminded the pride that it was best to touch the blood on the hyena's corpse.

He suspected that what made these hyenas crazy and die was probably a fatal virus. At first, it was brought by the red-eyed lioness, then passed to the water buffaloes, and finally to this group of unlucky spotted hyenas.

The reason why the lioness did not die but also became extremely strong was very likely because the other party's physique was strong and there was a strong immunity in her body. Not only was she not corroded by those viruses, but she also merged with those viruses and used those viruses to evolve faster.

Of course, this was all his guess.

If he could encounter that lioness again the next time, other than taking revenge for the humiliation of his crotch, he had to take a careful look and see if there were any human marks on her body.

Other than powerful humans, who else had the strength to sow these terrifying viruses?

Even if nature had these viruses long ago, if humans did not take the initiative to interfere, they would never have spread so quickly.

The previous ferocious tigers, black lions, and spotted hyenas all had human marks on them. Clearly, humans had long started to use the animals on the grassland to experiment.

However, some things were like rumors. It was easy to spread but difficult to eliminate.

At that time, if humans suffered a backlash because of this, it would not just be a disaster for the human world. All the creatures on Earth would probably suffer as well.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to roar at the humans. "Isn't it good to live well?"

Of course, he was only a lion that worked hard to survive and was not qualified to roar at humans. Therefore, he could only roar at the other animals on the grassland.

The strong smell of blood attracted many carnivores again.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and buried the hyenas' corpses and filled the pit that buried the water buffaloes again, he realized that the dark light flickering in the night was getting closer and closer.

It was still the scent of an unfamiliar pride.

"Isn't it good to live well?"
