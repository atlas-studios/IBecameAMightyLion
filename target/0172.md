Chapter 172: Golden Claw Rebirth (2)

"Whoosh\!"

The vegetation behind him rustled\!

This super pride almost attacked in full force.

Under the lead of the blue-eyed lion king, all the members ran through the bushes with a murderous aura, chasing after the lightning-like figure.

The roars of lions echoed throughout the entire forest.

The little animals that were hunting in the forest immediately panicked and fled in panic.

The originally quiet night became chaotic like the end of the world.

The super pride was very fast.

However, the figure was even faster\!

Before long, the figure disappeared into the forest in front of him and disappeared.

The blue-eyed lion king was not in a hurry and continued to chase after them.

The pride behind him lined up and did not let go of any grass as they ran.

But.

When he ran through the entire forest with the pride, he still did not find any trace of the foreign little lion.

At the end of the bushes, three strong lions were blocking the way.

They had been guarding here since a long time ago.

There were also members guarding outside the forest in other directions.

However, the figure did not run out of the forest.

He seemed to have suddenly disappeared into the forest\!

The blue-eyed lion king stood at the end of the bushes with its mouth open. As it panted, it turned around and looked at the bushes with a dark gaze.

He knew that that kid was definitely still hiding inside\!

If they did not find him in one go tonight, there would be endless trouble in the future\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly let out a roar and ordered the pride to enter the bushes again to search every patch of grass\!

This time, every time he walked a distance, he would look up at the trees around him.

Although lions did not like to climb trees, it did not mean that they could not climb trees.

The little lion's body was light. At this critical moment, it might climb up the tree to dodge.

He would not let go of any place in this search\!

The five strong lions followed not far behind him. As they carefully searched every bush, they were always vigilant of the wind and grass around them.

More than ten female lions followed behind, not leaving any place.

Suddenly\!

The blue-eyed lion king stopped and raised its head to look at a big tree in front of it.

A little leopard was lying on a branch at the highest point and looking at him in fear. She immediately shivered when she was looked at by his dignified and cold gaze.

The blue-eyed lion king turned around and looked at the female lion at the back.

That female lion was the female lion that had previously hidden on the tree and ambushed Chu Xiaoye, almost biting his neck.

Her body was light and she was extremely good at climbing trees.

Tonight, the pride mobilized just for a mere foreign male cub and was played by it. The blue-eyed lion king did not want this embarrassing scene to be seen by the other animals in the territory.

Therefore, he would not let go of any animals that stayed in this forest\!

Kill without mercy\!

He brought the pride and continued to search, leaving behind the lioness who only knew how to climb trees.

It was just a small leopard that had just become an adult. Even if an adult leopard was here, the female lion could easily kill them\!

The female lion quickly came under the tree, raised her head, bared her fangs, and roared at the little leopard on the tree.

Belita lay on the tree, trembling, and let out a terrified whimper.

This was the effect the female lions wanted. First, they would use their roars to make the other party tremble in fear. They would not be able to jump towards other trees and then charge up to kill them\!

She took a few steps back and suddenly jumped up. Just as she was about to land on the tree, leaves suddenly flew up and water splashed everywhere in the pool beside her\!

A figure suddenly jumped up and bit her throat\!

"Bang\!"

Her body tilted and she fell heavily to the ground.

She opened her mouth and widened her eyes. She wanted to roar, but she could not make a sound.

"Crack\!"

Chu Xiaoye's two rows of sharp teeth pierced through her throat\!

This commotion naturally attracted the attention of the female lions in front\!

"Roar—"

The ten-over female lions immediately roared angrily, changed directions, and ran over.

The blue-eyed lion king at the front immediately brought the five strong lions and quickly turned around\!

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye turned around and rushed out. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the dense bushes.

As for the female lion whose throat he had bitten off, she lay in place with her eyes wide open. After twitching a few times, she died\!

The pride chased angrily\!

On the tree, Belita watched this scene in a daze, her body still trembling.

Not long after, the male leopard rushed over with the female leopard and Belia. He called out to her in a low voice and told her to come down quickly.

The male leopard seemed to have already sensed the blue-eyed lion king's murderous aura.

If they stayed in this troublesome place any longer, their lives would probably be lost here.

Belita's limbs turned limp and she climbed down the tree while trembling.

However, before they could leave, two lions and five female lions suddenly jumped out of the forest and blocked their path\!

Outside the bushes, the roar of a lion could be heard.

It seemed that they were surrounded by this super pride\!

The male leopard made a prompt decision and immediately roared. He brought his wife and two daughters and climbed back up the big tree that Belita had been hiding on\!

If he fled to the grassland, he would definitely die.

There was only a chance of survival if he hid on the tree.

Lions also knew how to climb trees, but most of them were female lions. Furthermore, they could not use their true strength on trees.

Therefore, as long as he stayed on the tree, there would be no lionesses who would just cross him and hurt his family\!

Under his lead, the lioness and the sisters hurriedly climbed up the tree and climbed to the highest branch.

The male leopard squatted on a branch in the middle, bared its fangs, and looked fiercely at the pride under the tree.

The two lions and the five female lions let out terrifying roars, but they could only surround the tree and look up eagerly.

However, the male leopard's mood was still very heavy.

If this group of lions stayed here forever, they would definitely starve to death.

He had lived here for many years and had long known this super pride. However, he had never seen them all mobilize at once. Furthermore, they were only doing this for a mere foreign cub.

He could not believe how brave and strong that cub was.

However, tonight, with the current situation of this super pride, no matter how powerful that kid was, he would probably not be able to escape.

It was only a matter of time before he was caught and killed.

"Roar—"

The roar of the blue-eyed lion king came from the bushes again\!

The male leopard had lived here for so long, but he rarely heard this powerful lion king roar so frequently like tonight.

It seemed that this super pride that made enemies tremble in fear had suffered again.

In the forest not far away, a female lion was lying in a pool of blood, twitching in pain. Her skull had collapsed, and her ears, nose, and mouth were bleeding.

Obviously, she could not survive.

The blue-eyed lion king stood in front of her, its eyes wide with anger and its body trembling.

This was his favorite lioness.

He lowered his noble and dignified head, stuck out his tongue, and licked her neck gently. Then, with a crack, he bit her neck\!

Two rows of sharp teeth pierced through her skin and locked her throat\!

The female lion widened her eyes and trembled violently a few times. She kicked with her limbs and stopped breathing completely.

The pride standing around saw this scene and kept quiet out of fear, anger, and shock.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out from the bushes at the side and suddenly slapped the mouth of the female lion closest to him\!

"Crack\!"

The female lion tilted her head and fell to the ground.

Blood sprayed out\!

A miserable scream sounded in the bushes again and spread throughout the surrounding grassland\!

Half of her face sank\!

The moment she landed, the figure had already jumped up and crawled into the bushes in front of her again to escape\!

The entire pride was shocked and furious. For the first time, they felt fear\!

"Roar—"

The blue-eyed lion king's roar sounded again\!

On the big tree.

The male leopard opened its mouth with a fascinating expression.

In the dark bushes.

The figure jumped like a ghost in the dense grass and bushes.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly jumped up and was actually five to six meters tall. He jumped onto a big tree and shrank, quickly hiding in the dense leaves.

He did not feel tired. Instead, he felt even more excited and full of strength\!

Every move and sneak attack of his seemed so calm and accurate, swift and ruthless\!

He wanted to make this super pride pay in blood\!
