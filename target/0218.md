Chapter 218: The Lion King's Submission\!

The night was quiet.

However, it was not calm.

The corpses of those giant strange fish emitted a strong smell of blood that quietly filled the surrounding forest.

Some animals in the forest and Central Plains were hiding in their caves and eager to attack.

However, the lion's powerful aura made them not dare to act rashly.

The mixed fur lion king lay on the ground, its face covered in blood as it raised its head. Its gaze passed through the dense canopy and looked at the vaguely visible silver moon in the night sky, looking absent-minded.

Blood flowed all over the ground.

The pain in his wound gradually turned numb.

He seemed to have accepted the reality of death. He no longer had fear or panic, and was calm and indifferent.

The three lions lay beside him and protected him silently.

Obviously, they also knew that their king was calmly waiting for the last moment to arrive.

The life of the lion king was magnificent and dazzling.

However, no matter how wonderful it was, it would ultimately end.

The pen bird had already left. When he was bitten on the neck by the giant strange fish, it had already fled.

The little bird also knew that his life was going to end here. Therefore, it immediately flew out of the forest with the news that his mission had failed.

When the lion king's vision gradually turned black and it was about to fall asleep, it suddenly felt a chill coming from the wound on its neck.

He opened his eyes and saw the young figure.

Chu Xiaoye was chewing the leaves and applying them on his wounds. He was meticulous and did not give him any chance to refuse or resist.

When the three lions saw this scene, their eyes immediately lit up, like flames that were about to be extinguished burning with hope again.

The lion king's head was dizzy and it no longer had the strength to care.

He lay on the ground and soon fell asleep.

Sometimes, when one fell asleep, they would never wake up again.

However, sometimes, when one fell asleep, they would have a good dream and tomorrow would be better.

Chu Xiaoye smeared the mixture of leaves and saliva all over his wounds, especially his front legs that had their bones bitten off. They were almost piled up in a thick circle.

Then, he walked to the side of the three lions and helped them apply the medicine.

After the treatment last night, the three lions trusted him very much, were very cooperative, and were very grateful.

After doing all of this, it was already late at night.

Chu Xiaoye stretched and climbed up the tree at the side, preparing to rest.

At this moment.

Catherine suddenly climbed up and stood in front of him. She lowered her head and avoided his eyes.

Chu Xiaoye stared at her for a while, not understanding.

Just as he was about to slap her head, the little lioness suddenly turned around.

A small wound appeared.

It turned out that during the battle just now, she had rushed too fiercely and was accidentally cut by the teeth of a strange fish.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He stared at her wound and observed it. It was not too serious. With this female cub's physique and recovery ability, she should recover in one night.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and slapped her tail, telling her to scram and not find trouble for no reason.

His saliva only saved seriously injured people and would not be used randomly.

Catherine turned her head and looked at him pitifully with her dark eyes.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye was not polite and told her not to go overboard\!

If she could not resist this wound, she would have died hundreds of times already. Would she still be alive until now?

Which animal on the grassland did not have a tenacious life force and strong resistance?

Furthermore, she had licked his blood quite a bit previously and was already immune to all poisons in her body. Now that she had mutated and become even stronger, this small wound was nothing\!

This female cub thought that she had performed well today and killed many enemies, so she was arrogant and wanted a yard after taking an inch?

He would not encourage her\!

Perhaps she would deliberately hurt herself every day.

Hmph\! Too much\!

"Roar—"

He growled and glared at her, telling her to go down quickly and stop pretending in front of him.

She was stronger than a lion\!

Seeing that he had seen through her intentions, Catherine immediately lowered her head and climbed down the tree in shame.

Blue, who was sitting on another tree, muttered, "Our king."

A night passed in the blink of an eye.

Catherine lay under the tree and looked up at the figure on the tree until dawn.

When the sun rose, the forest was still dark, but there were more happy little lives.

On the branches, all sorts of birds cried out and jumped around. It was very lively.

It seemed that the surrounding sea pythons had been cleared.

The three lions were woken up by the noise of the birds.

They opened their eyes and looked at their king. They immediately stood up.

At this moment, they realized in pleasant surprise that the wounds on their bodies had already healed and formed scabs. They no longer felt the heart-wrenching pain from yesterday.

They walked calmly and were extremely excited.

They immediately came in front of the king, their expressions instantly turning grave.

Their king lay on the ground motionless.

Could it be that…

Suddenly, mixed fur opened his eyes and looked at them. Then, he slowly raised his head, seemingly confused.

The three lions were pleasantly surprised and growled excitedly.

The lion king finally woke up completely.

He suddenly stood up and turned his head to look at the wounds on his body. Then, he quickly twisted his neck. The two rows of fatal wounds on his neck were no longer painful\!

He widened his eyes in disbelief.

Then, he lowered his head and looked at his two front legs.

He tried to walk a few steps. Although it was still a little painful, the two broken bones actually grew back together and started to heal\!

Last night, he was already disabled and could not move. Now, he could actually walk again\!

He limped forward and took a few more steps, his body trembling in excitement.

He did not die, he survived\!

Furthermore, his legs did not become crippled\!

His broken bones actually started to heal miraculously\!

The fatal wounds on his head, face, and neck actually formed scars overnight and he no longer felt any pain\!

This was unbelievable\!

He was stunned in place and felt like he was dreaming.

He had already lost all hope last night and closed his eyes, preparing to die.

However, when he opened his eyes again today, it was still this world. It was still these familiar figures and familiar auras.

He had regained life\!

Under a big tree not far away, the lioness that had once belonged to him was looking at him with a complicated gaze.

The day before, she was in the same situation as him. She was already waiting for death, but she miraculously survived.

At this moment, his feelings should be the same as hers back then.

He was excited, joyful, incredulous and in disbelief. He felt as if he was dreaming.

The sky was so blue, the vegetation was so green, and the world was so beautiful.

It was good to be alive.

The female lion raised her head and looked deeply at the young king on the tree.

That was her king.

From yesterday onwards, he would be her king for life.

The three lions also looked at the tree.

The mixed fur lion king's excited mood slowly calmed down.

He lowered his head and was silent for a long time. Then, he raised his head again and looked at the young figure on the tree.

Then, he limped over.

The morning sun was blocked by the dense forest outside, but its light still shone on the ground and into the hearts of many animals.

They knew of its existence.

Some light could not be blocked.

The mixed fur lion king came under the tree and looked at Catherine. Then, it raised its head and looked at the young lion king on the tree. It let out a low growl.

Then, he lowered his body and crawled on the ground, slowly lowering his head.

This powerful lion that had once wandered for many years, experienced hundreds of battles, and finally became a king finally lowered its arrogant head and submitted to the strength and kindness of this young lion king.

Catherine looked up at the figure in obsession.

Back then, when they were still so young, she lay in the grass and secretly looked at him on the tree.

At that moment, she knew how dazzling he would be today.

His tomorrow would also be dazzling\!

She was sincerely proud of him, happy, and joyful.

However, she also knew clearly that tomorrow would still not be calm and simple.

The clouds always wanted to cover his light, and the rain always wanted to wet his wings. His sky was still far away.

However, it was okay.

She believed that he could defeat everything.

And she would follow by his side forever and remove all obstacles for him, even if she had to give up everything.

The lion king's submission shocked the three lions, but they did not hesitate at all.

They immediately followed and crawled behind their former king. They faced the tree and lowered their huge, dignified heads to show their submission.

They were willing.

This young king saved their lives twice.

His strength also made them respect and submit to him from the bottom of their hearts.

They were willing to follow him to the ends of the world and fight everywhere\!

When the female lion not far away saw this scene, the last trace of guilt in her heart finally disappeared.

No matter how the world changed or how many feelings there were, to them, only the strongest could ultimately become their true king.

On the tree beside him, Blue was pleased to see this scene.

This young king finally started to stand out and erupt with the charm of a king. His pride and his faction would become stronger and stronger\!

On that beautiful grassland, they would welcome the youngest and strongest king\!
