Chapter 288: Father's Heroism

 "Whoosh\!"

When the black lion leader's huge claws were about to slap Chu Xiaoye's head heavily, a white figure suddenly flashed behind him and a golden light flashed quickly, hitting the black lion leader's head\!

Tilly's sharp golden claws did not penetrate the black lion leader's tough fur.

However, this sudden attack frightened the other party.

The black lion leader hurriedly jumped away.

The huge claw also restrained its strength and did not have the time to land.

Tilly immediately protected Chu Xiaoye and took the initiative to attack again, pouncing on the black lion leader.

"Bang\!"

This strong black lion leader was faster than her and instantly arrived in front of her. She swung her claws and sent her flying.

Chu Xiaoye had long taken this opportunity to get up. His head swayed and he immediately woke up.

However, his body was still a little limp and his feet were numb. He could not attack.

He immediately retreated and pulled away from the black lion leader.

The strange heat in his body was still surging towards his head and body from afar, quickly healing his injuries.

He needed time.

The black lion leader slapped Tilly away and was about to continue charging at him. Unexpectedly, Tilly rushed over again and suddenly jumped. She raised her golden claw and shot towards the black lion leader like a meteor\!

The black lion leader's pupils constricted. For once, he did not face the attack head-on. His body swayed and he retreated, avoiding this claw. Then, he swung his claw and slapped Tilly away again.

This time, he did not let go of this lioness cub with snow-white fur.

He rushed over and decided to kill this lioness cub first.

Because the female cub's golden claws just now really made him feel a threat. He had to eliminate this threat completely\!

"Whoosh—"

He rushed over like a ghost and suddenly smashed his huge claws at Tilly's head.

Tilly had just got up from the ground when she felt a strong wind pounce on her. She hurriedly lowered her head and narrowly dodged it. Then, she immediately rolled out and widened the distance.

However, this black lion leader was extremely fast. It instantly arrived in front of her and slapped her again.

This time, Tilly could not dodge and could only raise her claws to resist.

"Bang\!"

A huge force suddenly attacked\!

She was sent flying.

At the same time, a crisp sound came from her right front leg. It had clearly been broken by the slap.

She landed heavily on the ground and struggled to stand up, but she felt an intense pain in her right front leg and could not touch the ground at all.

Her leg was broken.

The black lion leader's gaze was cold. He did not use his ghost-like movement technique again and walked over step by step, like a demon slowly torturing her with fear and death.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly rushed over like a cannonball that had been fired and hit the black lion leader heavily with a bang\!

The black lion leader's strong body was sent flying\!

Before he could land on the ground, the figure spat out a black stream of air from behind and shot out again. Its speed was so fast that he could not see clearly. With a bang, it hit him heavily again\!

The black lion leader flew up again.

However, just as he was about to land on the ground, he flew up again with a bang.

"Roar—"

The black lion leader flew into the air and let out an angry roar. He danced and brandished his claws. He was flustered and exasperated, and also inexplicably terrified.

For the first time, he felt afraid.

"Bang\!"

He had just landed halfway when the figure rushed up from below and hit him heavily again\!

This time, it hit his abdomen\!

An intense pain assaulted him\!

His vision turned black and he felt that his internal organs were almost crushed\!

No matter how strong he was, how fast he was, or how strong he was, he was in midair and could not land. He could not use anything\!

He arched his body and flew up again. The pain in his abdomen suddenly made him cry, mucus, and saliva.

He started to land.

"Pfft—"

The terrifying airflow sounded again\!

At the same time, a stench assaulted him\!

He landed halfway and flew up again.

This time, the figure still hit his soft abdomen\!

"Ugh —"

As he flew up, he opened his mouth and spat out the food dregs in his stomach. At the same time, there was scarlet blood.

His internal organs were broken.

"Roar—"

When he started to land, he suddenly opened his mouth and roared in fear. He ordered the team in front to stop chasing after the pride and quickly return to save him.

This was the first time he felt so terrified and helpless\!

He was an animal on land. Wasn't the competition between lions on land? Why did they let him fly in the sky all the time, up and down?

"Bang\!"

He flew up again.

This time, he vomited blood.

The world in front of him swayed violently. There was only darkness up and down and he could not see anything.

He tried his best and roared angrily, ordering the black lion army to return quickly.

At this moment, his black lion army was completely in chaos because of his orders to retreat.

Originally, these more than two hundred black lions were already chasing over with an unstoppable aura. Just as they were about to catch all the lions hiding at the edge of the forest, a group of old lions that did not care about their lives suddenly rushed over. Like a sharp dagger, they pierced into the middle of them and bit and fought crazily.

Those old lions seemed to have gone crazy. Even though their necks and legs had been bitten and their legs broken, they still bit their bodies with all their might and did not let go. There were also some lions that they bit to the ground and could not stand up. They actually took advantage of their battle to bite their crotch and back. They were even more terrifying than those despicable hyenas\!

Soon, their formation was frightened by this group of crazy old lions.

Although they were very brave, no one wanted to be wrapped around by this group of old lions that were about to die of old age. As long as they bit you, they would never let go. Even if you bit their necks, their teeth would still bite into your flesh, making you unable to resist the fangs and claws of other old lions\!

No one wanted to die.

Therefore, the originally majestic black lion army was instantly broken by this group of old and crazy lions.

Just as they were panicking, the roar of the black lion leader suddenly sounded. It was faster and more miserable than before, telling them to retreat quickly\!

Hence, they could only turn around and retreat.

In the end, just as they turned around and were about to retreat, the elderly lions suddenly roared in unison and chased after them even more crazily and excitedly.

At this moment, under the orders of the black lion leader, everyone no longer had any fighting spirit and wanted to retreat quickly. Therefore, the formation became even more chaotic.

The black lions following behind were pounced on by the elderly lions one by one, but none of them came to save them. Their companions were running faster than the other\!

At the same time, the pride that had retreated to the foot of the mountain suddenly had high morale and fighting spirit under the lead of One-eyed, Lars, and the other lions. They counterattacked\!

"Roar—"

Their roars shook the sky\!

The black pride that was retreating turned around and saw that the dense pride numbered about four to five hundred. They occupied the entire grassland, bared their fangs, and pounced at them with fierce eyes\!

This terrifying scene immediately scared their souls out of their bodies. They no longer cared about formation and orders and immediately ran away in panic, no longer having any fighting spirit.

When they fled to the place where their leader gave the orders, they were terrified to see that their powerful and invincible leader was actually floating up and down in the air, covered in blood, vomiting blood and broken internal organs continuously. His body was limp and his bones were broken. He had long died\!

Under their leader was a figure spewing black smoke. It had been moving up and down in the ground and in the air. It was so fast that they could not see the other party's appearance. It was attacking their leader's body continuously\!

At the same time, there was already a circle of spectators.

A female cub with snow-white fur, a young lion with a long tail, a cold female cub covered in blood and claws that flickered with silver light, a female cub with blue eyes, and two young female leopards.

They were all gathered there, looking up and staring at the scene up and down with blank expressions.

The black lions were terrified when they saw this scene. The last trace of hope in their hearts completely disappeared.

Since their leader was already dead, how could they fight?

"Roar—"

The crazy old lion at the back was chasing after them with the majestic pride\!

The black pride no longer hesitated and immediately fled in panic\!

Originally, their morale was high and victory was in their grasp. At this moment, they were like stray dogs that fled in a sorry state. Even if they were pushed to the ground by the elderly lions, they did not dare to retaliate and only struggled to get up, thinking of escaping.

Fear and despair instantly entered the hearts of every member of the black pride.

They were focused on escaping\!

One side chased while one side fled, and they killed in the chaos.

Soon, the green grass was filled with the corpses of black lions.

Their powerful combat strength was completely gone in the atmosphere of fear and escape.

The cold father's lush mane was covered in blood.

He was covered in wounds, but he was in high spirits and full of fighting spirit. He led the aged lion army and the pride behind him, continuing to chase after the terrified black lion army\!

Victory increased every member's courage and strength.

The female lions and young cubs that had been trembling in fear in the back just a moment ago now roared loudly with a murderous aura. They fought to be the first to chase after the ferocious enemies.

Chu Xiaoye finally stopped farting and torturing corpses.

He raised his head and looked at the strong figure running at the front. He seemed to see the strong and heroic figure running towards the enemy when the enemy invaded when he was young.

His mane fluttered and the wind was still strong.

His father was still strong\!
