Chapter 536: Simp

After dawn.

Carter left Sunset Pass with the army and continued forward.

There were more than 1,000 people guarding Sunset Pass to prevent the small wave army at the border of the Bolton Kingdom from entering the village to plunder through this place.

Although the Bolton Kingdom was currently gathering its troops and preparing to take revenge in the Elven Kingdom, they did not dare to provoke their Kast Empire for the time being to prevent being attacked from both sides, it was better to be careful.

Furthermore, if the march was unfavorable, they could retreat again and recuperate in this strong city, continuing to wait for the opportunity.

Three days later, they arrived at Black Water City.

A majestic castle stood strikingly in the middle of the ancient city.

Outside the tall city wall was a black river that surrounded the entire city. The river water was not black, but it was black and shining under the light of the ancient city wall. It was like dead water, dark and dense.

Black Water City was the city of Carlo Danota.

Carlo was a strong orc in his fifties and Carter's uncle. He had been expelled from the capital because of some mistakes in his early years and came here. He lived here for more than ten years.

He had more than ten thousand troops under him and was stationed here all year round, managing this city until it was as strong as an iron bucket.

As members of the Danota family, Carter did not bring the army directly to the city this time. Instead, she brought Chu Xiaoye and the others, as well as more than twenty guards, to the city and called for her uncle.

"I'm Princess Carter and Lord Carlo's niece. Please open the city gate."

Carter drew her reins and stood on the riverbank below the city and shouted up.

Soon, the city gate opened.

Then, the huge drawbridge slowly landed, but only a small portion in the middle landed and was placed on the river, allowing only one horse to pass.

A tall young man with loose silver hair rode a horse and wore an exquisite black armor. He walked out quickly with his guards.

"Oh\! My dear Sister Carter, it's really you\!"

The tall young man rode over, his voice filled with excitement. He steadily reined in the horse in front of Carter and looked at the heroic young female general in front of him with shining eyes.

Carter smiled politely. "Brother Sorvil, is Uncle Carlo okay? Can I see him?"

The young man named Sorvil smiled and said, "Of course you can. Sister Carter, I haven't seen you for a year. You're becoming more and more slender and beautiful. I heard that you're leading the army at the border. Why did you suddenly return?"

Carter frowned. She did not believe that Black Water City had not received any news.

Sunset Pass was not far from here. When they attacked the city, there was smoke. How could Black Water City not know?

Carter pondered for a moment and smiled. "My father secretly ordered me to bring the army back to the Holy City. Brother Sorvil, can you put down the drawbridge and let us go over?"

Sorvil looked at Chu Xiaoye and the others behind her and was stunned for a moment. He stared at Chu Xiaoye and the few elven girls and said, "They're elves?"

Carter nodded. "Yes, but now, they have already sworn allegiance to me."

Sorvil shrugged and revealed his white teeth. He said with a smile, "Sister Carter has been full of charm since she was young. No one can resist her. Let's go in and meet my father."

Carter did not move her horse immediately. He said, "Brother Sorvil, my army is still in the field. I have to bring them in."

Sorvil raised his head and looked behind. He suddenly smiled and said, "Our city is too crowded. With so many people coming in, we have to go back and report to Father and let him give the orders to prepare. Sister Carter, let's go in first."

Carter hesitated for a moment, looked up at the tall city in front of him, and nodded. "Alright."

Sorvil followed beside her and walked alongside her. He did not hide the admiration in his eyes.

When they entered the city gate, the drawbridge was put away and the heavy city gate slowly closed.

Sorvil brought Carter into the castle.

When they entered the door, Sorvil looked at the guards behind Carter and smiled. "Sister Carter, Father has received the news and is waiting for you in the living room. Your guards don't need to go in. Here, we're all family. I'll protect you."

Carter looked back and said to Chu Xiaoye, "You and Vilis follow me."

Sorvil looked at the two of them and did not speak anymore. He walked in front.

"Please, Sister Carter."

When he came to the living room, Sorvil opened the door and said politely.

Carter walked in with Chu Xiaoye and Vilis.

A tall and strong middle-aged man with white skin smiled in his seat. "Carter, my dear niece, come and sit down. Tell your Uncle Carlo about your recent situation."

In the living room, other than this middle-aged man, there were also a few men sitting there, looking at the girl who came in with a smile.

Carter quickly walked towards the middle-aged man and smiled. "Uncle Carlo, you're still as strong and energetic as before\!"

"Hahaha…"

Carlo laughed heartily and pointed at the seat beside him. "Carter, sit down and talk. You don't have to be polite here."

Sorvil hurriedly walked over and helped her pull out a chair. He smiled and said, "Sister Carter, please sit."

Carter thanked her and sat down in the chair. Just as he was thinking about how to open his mouth, a thin old man opposite him smiled and said, "Princess Carter, I heard that you killed the Geck brothers of the Lusni family, at the border. Is that true?"

Carter looked at him and said, "Geck committed treason and colluded with the Bolton Kingdom. Now, he and his brother's corpses are outside the city."

The old man shrugged and did not speak again.

Carlo laughed. "Carter, I heard that His Majesty ordered you to return to the capital with the corpses of the Geck brothers, right?"

Carter nodded. "Yes, Uncle Carlo. I came here to ask you to put down the drawbridge, open the city gate, and let us pass."

Carlo smiled and said, "My dear niece, the City Lord of Black Water City is your uncle. You can pass at any time if you want. Don't be polite."

Carter was delighted, but she felt that it was too easy. "Really, Uncle?"

Carlo spread his hands and said, "Of course it's true. I can let Sorvil accompany you out and bring your army in."

Carter hurriedly stood up and said, "Thank you, Uncle. I'll inform them now."

"Princess Carter."

At this moment, a thin and tall middle-aged man sitting opposite him suddenly said, "It's not in accordance with the rules for you to bring the army back to the capital. Black Water City can let you go, but letting your army go would be a little difficult."

Carter narrowed her eyes at him and said, "Uncle, this is?"

Carlo explained with a smile, "This is Sorvil's uncle, the leader of our Black Water City army, Lord Merck."

Carter looked at the middle-aged man opposite him and sneered. "Lord Merck, why do I remember that the City Lord of Black Water City is my uncle? Whether my army can pass through here is not up to you."

Merck nodded and said, "Of course, it's not up to me to decide. However, whether the soldiers guarding the city wall will put down the drawbridge, open the city gate, and suddenly release arrows is up to me now."

Carter was stunned for a moment before she suddenly turned around and looked at her uncle.

Carlo smiled helplessly. "Carter, I'm sorry. I handed the army to Lord Merck to manage. He's too stubborn. Sometimes, I really can't persuade him. You have to convince him."

Carter finally understood.

This fake uncle had been teasing her.

She suppressed the anger in her heart and looked at the middle-aged man opposite her. She said coldly, "Lord Merck, I brought the army back to the capital this time under my father's orders. Could it be that you want to disobey the king's orders?"

Merck hurriedly waved his hand and said, "Princess, you're being too serious. I don't dare to. However, I did not see the king's orders you mentioned. If I saw them, I promise to let you go immediately."

Carter stared at him coldly.

This Lord Merck also looked at her with a cold smile, looking fearless.

Another middle-aged man with a big belly suddenly smiled and said, "Merck, be polite to the princess."

Then, he looked at the girl in front of him and said with a smile, "Princess Carter, actually, it's not impossible to let your army go over. However, you have to show some sincerity. Otherwise, if people enter the city and it's chaotic, the soldiers and citizens of Black Water City will probably not be too happy."

Carter looked at him and said, "What is the sincerity this lord is talking about?"

Merck said directly, "It's very simple. If the princess agrees to marry my Black Water City, we will naturally let her go. Furthermore, the Black Water City will send eight thousand soldiers to follow the princess and rush to the Holy City together…"

"Work together\!"

The big-bellied middle-aged man answered with a smile.

Carter's heart trembled and his expression was a little ugly.

It turned out that these people had long known her true goal of leading the army into the Holy City.

"Carter."

Carlo said with a smile, "Sorvil is handsome and brave and smart since young. His sword skills are one of the best in my Black Water City. It will not disgrace your status."

Sorvil, who was standing behind him, looked at the girl in front of him with a radiant expression. "Sister Carter, I've admired you for a long time. I hope you can give me a chance to perform well. No matter what you want to do with the army in the capital, I will support you with all my might\! And my Black Water City will always be your strongest support\!"

Carter's eyes revealed a hint of ridicule. Just as she was about to refuse, Chu Xiaoye, who was standing behind her, suddenly touched her.

"Princess Carter, I hope you can consider it carefully. If the soldiers of my Black Water City join your army, you will be like a tiger that has grown wings."

Merck said confidently.

Carter was silent for a moment before he looked at Carlo and said, "Uncle Carlo, if I agree to this condition, will you support me?"

Carlo said with a smile, "Of course. I only have two sons. Sorvil is my most valued eldest son. In the future, Black Water City will be his. If you marry him, our entire Black Water City will support you, no matter what you want to do."

Carter revealed a conflicted expression. After a while, she said, "Uncle Carlo, I need to go back and consider it. At least, I need to discuss it with my generals. I'll give you an answer in a day at most."

"Alright\!"

Carlo stood up with a smile. "I believe that with the princess's intelligence, she will definitely make the best choice."

He looked behind him and said, "Sorvil, send the princess off. Talk to her more, talk about your loyalty, your admiration for the princess, and my Black Water City's thirst for a master."

Sorvil was excited. He walked in front of Carter and said politely, "Princess, please."

Carter bent at Carlo and turned to walk out of the living room.

At this moment, a dozen strong orcs hiding behind the curtain walked out with axes in their hands.

"See, I told you that my niece understands the times. She knows clearly what she wants and what she has to pay. A girl with strong ambition like her who is unwilling to submit to others knows how to use her body and identity the most."

Carlo said with a smile.

Merck frowned and said, "I think it's better to keep them here first."

Carlo shrugged and said, "In this case, we'll be in a deadlock. With Carter's temper, she won't let the matter rest. Furthermore, her army of twenty thousand is not to be trifled with. Don't worry, Merck. I know my niece. She will definitely agree. Her body and reputation are nothing to her. The army and support of my Black Water City are what she wants the most."

Merck said, "Let's hope so."

When Sorvil walked out of the castle with Carter, he saw two groups of people gathered in front of the gate, seemingly ready to fight.

One wave was Carter's guards and the few elf girls, and the other was the people of Black Water City.

"Yo\! Little elf, you dare to be so arrogant after coming to my territory? Since I've taken a fancy to you, it's your fortune\! Do all these little guards want to fight me?"

A young man in his twenties was cursing loudly, looking rather arrogant.

Behind him were the guards of Black Water City, holding weapons and fueling his arrogance.

Opposite him, the three elven girls and Carter's guards drew their swords and did not show any weakness.

"Cook, don't be rude\!"

Sorvil hurriedly walked over and reprimanded solemnly, "This is Princess Carter's guard\!"

The young man named Cook turned around and said with a smile, "My dear brother, you also said that they are only the guards of Princess Carter. I'm not being rude. I'm being gracious\!"

This young man was rather similar to Carlo. He was tall and had white skin. His silver hair was tied into a whip and he was wearing a scarlet robe, his face wild.

He was Carlo's second son, Cook.

"Yo, Sister Carter, long time no see. You're becoming taller and prettier."

When Cook saw Carter, he immediately greeted her with a smile. His hypocritical appearance was comparable to his father.

Carter ignored him and walked in front of Lanisi and the others. She asked in a low voice, "What's wrong?"

Fei'er said angrily, "When this baddie saw us just now, he came over to tease us… tease us. He even extended his hand and wanted to touch… touch Sister Lanisi's face. He also said… He also said that he wanted Sister Lanisi to be his…"

"Fei'er\!"

Lanisi looked at her and said to Carter, "Princess, it's okay. Can we go?"

She knew that this was not a place to stay for long. Their army was still outside, and they were only accompanied by twenty-over guards. It was best not to cause trouble.

Carter was about to nod when Cook suddenly walked close and stared at Lanisi with a smile. "Go? Why are you in a hurry to go? Little elf, can't our Black Water City satisfy you? Don't be anxious. As long as you stay, I, Cook, promise that I'll make you satisfied tonight, hehehehe."

"Bam\!"

Carter suddenly slapped him.

Cook was caught off guard and almost fell.

He covered his burning face and looked at the girl in front of him in disbelief. "Sister Carter, what do you mean? You came today to beg us, right?"

"Cook\! Shut up\!"

Sorvil berated angrily.

Cook turned to look at him and mocked him shrilly, "Sorvil, I'm not talking to you. You miss this Princess Carter every day and are willing to kneel down and lick her toes, but I won't. This is Black Water City, not the Holy City\! She killed the people of the Lusni family at the border and is now preparing to return to the capital with the army. This doesn't conform to the rules\! Even if she's a princess, my Black Water City can still follow the national law and not let her go\! She should be begging us to marry you, not like you, still licking her without dignity\!"

"Bam\!"

Sorvil suddenly raised his palm and slapped him too, saying angrily, "Cook\! Now is not the time for you to mess around\! Princess Carter is noble and a member of the royal family. Even her father treats her politely. How can you be so rude?"

Cook covered his face and looked at him with hatred. "Sorvil, this slap of yours will hurt you."

After saying that, he suddenly turned around and looked at Carter, shouting, "Men\! Take the princess down\! Tie up the four elven girls behind her and send them to my room\! I want to see if we're the ones in charge of this Black Water City or her\!"

"Yes, Young Master Cook\!"

The guards, who had already drawn their weapons and prepared to fight, immediately rushed up and surrounded Carter and her guards.

More guards rushed in from outside the castle.

Sorvil said angrily, "Who dares?"

Cook sneered with a mocking expression. "My dear brother, these guards are my people. I believe that Father will agree to my wise decision, because I have already seen Father bring those death warriors into the meeting room. Those death warriors are not just to admire the princess's beauty."

Sorvil pulled out the sword at his waist and pointed at him. "Cook\! Tell your people to retreat\! Otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite to you\!"

Cook was fearless and still sneered. "Do you want to hurt your beloved brother for a ruthless woman? Sorvil, you're really stupid. Carter has a twenty thousand army outside. She finally made a mistake and came in and became a turtle in our jar. Are you going to let her out again? Is there water in your brain?"

Sorvil was stunned for a moment and said angrily, "This is Father and Uncle's decision\! Princess Carter has already agreed to our conditions. Cook, let your people retreat quickly\!"

"Is that so?"

Cook looked at Carter and smiled. "Princess, you agreed to marry my brother, right?"

Carter looked at him coldly and did not answer.

Cook spread his hands at his brother and said, "Look, it seems that Her Highness  did not agree."

Sorvil's face turned red. "The princess said that she would return and consider it. She will give me the answer in a day\! She will definitely agree."

Cook looked at him as if he was an idiot and said, "If she was willing, she would agree to you now, not lie to you and say that she needs to think about it for a day. Of course, such a marriage does need time to think. You can give her a day to think about it, but let her think in this Black Water City and not foolishly let them go\!"

Sorvil fell silent and looked at his beloved princess.

Carter said coldly, "I said that I'm going out to discuss with my generals."

Cook smiled and said, "Princess, why do you need to discuss your marriage with others? Furthermore, you're the general of the twenty thousand army and their queen. Your words are an imperial edict. Who dares to disobey?"

Carter's heart trembled and he looked at him coldly.

Cook looked at his brother and said, "Sorvil, the princess is our guest. We can't leave as soon as she arrives, right? Wouldn't that make us seem rude? How about this, bring the princess to your mansion and hold a banquet to welcome her tonight. Let the princess enjoy the passion of our Black Water City while thinking. A day should pass quickly. What do you think?"

Sorvil was a little hesitant. "But, Father…"

Cook smiled and said, "Father will agree. I'll explain to him personally. Don't worry."

Sorvil looked at Carter in embarrassment and said, "Sister Carter, why don't you listen to Cook and stay in Black Water City for a day?"

Carter looked at him coldly and said, "What if I say no?"

Sorvil was troubled. "This…"

Cook shrugged and said, "If the princess doesn't agree, there's nothing I can do. Some women are like that. If they don't like to eat soft food, they like to eat hard food. To be honest, I really don't want to offend the princess. After all, you might be my sister-in-law in the future."

Carter held the sword at her waist. Just as she was about to pull out the sword, Chu Xiaoye, who was standing behind her, touched her again.

Cook stared at her with a faint smile, as if he was not worried that she would be angry.

Carter let go of the sword and said coldly, "Alright, Sorvil, I'll go to your mansion for the time being. However, you have to guarantee the safety of me and all my guards."

Sorvil was delighted. Just as he was about to agree, Cook suddenly said, "Princess, you might not have heard me clearly. What I just said was to let you go to Sorvil's mansion alone, not with your guards."

He looked at Lanisi and the others, not hiding the desire on his face. He smiled and said, "I want these sexy and charming elf girls. They will follow me to my mansion. As for your other guards, I will find another place to settle them. Princess, don't worry. I can guarantee that I won't hurt their lives."

Carter was about to flare up when Chu Xiaoye, who was standing behind her, suddenly said, "Lord Cook, did your father or your teacher tell you that you have to be low-key and not be too arrogant?"

With that said, everyone looked behind Carter at the short elf youth.

"Who do you think you are?"

Cook was stunned at first, then looked at him with a dark smile and said, "I thought that you were a girl and was going to bring you to play. But this is good. I have a few boys who like boys. Kid, don't cry from fright later."

Chu Xiaoye looked at him in surprise and said, "Lord Cook, are you blind? I'm clearly a girl. How am I a boy?"

At these words, even Carter turned her head and looked at him in shock.

Cook was stunned for a few seconds before he took a few steps forward and sized him up. He asked suspiciously, "You're a girl?"

"Of course."

Chu Xiaoye also took a few steps forward, spread his legs, and said seriously, "Lord Cook, if you don't believe me, feel around and see if I have a little brother."

Cook was stunned. Just as he was about to go forward, he suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked at him with a bright light in his eyes.

Just as he was about to speak, Chu Xiaoye suddenly lowered his body and his clothes automatically fell off. He instantly turned into a golden-haired lion and pounced forward with a whoosh, biting his throat\!

"Crack\!"

Two rows of sharp teeth instantly pierced through his muscles and his throat\!

Cook fell to the ground before he could react.

"Clang\!"

Carter suddenly pulled out her sword and slashed Sorvil's thigh. She shouted, "Kill\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Denise and Fei'er's arrows shot out when they heard the sound\!

The twenty-over guards immediately roared and rushed up.

Sorvil was completely unguarded and knelt on the ground.

Carter grabbed his hair and placed the sword in her hand on his neck. She shouted, "Go\!"

At this moment, the Second Young Master of Black Water City, Cook, had already widened his eyes and died\!

Chu Xiaoye turned into a lion and followed beside Lanisi and the others. He fought and retreated.

"Murder\! Murder\! Second Young Master Cook was killed by a thief\!"

The streets outside the castle were in chaos.

The guards of Black Water City rushed over from everywhere.

Carlo, who was discussing something in the conference room, immediately roared angrily when he heard the news and hurriedly ran out with his men.

"Catch them\! Catch them\!"

The citizens on the street panicked and ran everywhere. The soldiers everywhere hurriedly gathered.

"Charge out\! Go up the city wall\!"

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and immediately led the way with the huge sword loli.

The spinning storm of the huge sword loli was like an unstoppable hurricane that swept in front of him.

"Sorvil\! Order them to move aside\! Otherwise, I'll cut your throat\!"

Carter placed the sword tightly on Sorvil's neck and shouted.

Blood had already flowed out of Sorvil's neck.

His face was pale, and he retreated with them as if he had lost his soul. After a long time, he suddenly turned around and roared at the soldiers of Black Water City in front of him, "Move\! Let the princess leave\!"

Then, he raised his head and looked pitifully at the girl he loved, begging, "Princess, I can help you leave. I will help you plead with Father for Cook's death. Please… Please marry me. I love you, I really love you. Please…"

He was a simp. In the end, he had nothing.

Chu Xiaoye sighed inwardly and suddenly felt a little guilty.

This young master might never have thought that the goddess he loved foolishly had actually long become a loyal simp of another man. Furthermore, she was even more infatuated and engrossed than him.
