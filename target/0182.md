Chapter 182: Evolution Again\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye rushed towards the hyena queen\!

The hyena queen did not back down and took the initiative to welcome him, jumping up.

The claws of both sides collided heavily again\!

After Chu Xiaoye landed, he felt a burning pain in his right claw again. A bone-deep scratch appeared on his palm.

The hyena queen's claws were the same.

Chu Xiaoye knew that the other party's claws were definitely not as sharp as his golden claws. Her wounds were also not healing as quickly as his.

Therefore, he was not afraid of the other party.

As long as he found the right opportunity, he would be able to cut off the other party's foot\!

However, the hyena queen clearly realized what was happening.

It did not decide to fight him alone.

Under its gaze, the hyenas around it immediately surged forward\!

Chu Xiaoye could only jump onto the tree again.

He looked at the hyenas around him and thought of the strategy of the pride he had faced that night. He would use the terrain advantage to defeat them one by one, suddenly attack, and gradually assassinate them\!

However, this required a precondition.

He needed to escape the hyenas' encirclement and leave them far behind.

However, it seemed impossible now.

Nearly 100 hyenas surrounded a large area.

If he fled from the ground, no matter how fast he was, he would definitely be bitten all over.

If he jumped from the tree to escape, not only would it be extremely exhausting, his escaping speed would also be slower than the hyenas below.

After all, the trees in the bushes were not arranged in a straight line. In some places, there were even swamps without trees.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was thinking about his next move, the roars of the Chino brothers suddenly came from outside the bushes\!

They had returned from hunting and smelled the scent of hyenas, so they charged back bravely.

Chu Xiaoye's heart sank and he cursed inwardly.

"Roar—"

He hurriedly roared angrily and let the two idiots escape\!

The jackal couple and Doya were already dead. He did not want the two brothers to die miserably again. After all, they had followed him all the way. Even if they did not contribute, they had worked hard. In the future, they could also help patrol the territory.

When the Chino brothers heard his roar, they rushed over even more bravely. Their roars were touched and impassioned\!

It was as if they were saying, "Boss\! We will live and die with you\!"

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to swear. "Idiot\!"

When the Chino brothers charged into the bushes with a high fighting spirit, they suddenly saw nearly a hundred densely-packed hyenas\!

The hyena army's dark and cold eyes looked at them uniformly.

The two brothers froze in place, stunned.

This… What was going on?

"Roar—"

The two brothers immediately roared angrily and turned to run without hesitation\!

He seemed to be saying, "Boss, then go ahead\! We'll be leaving first. Bye\!"

They almost peed their pants\!

There were so many dogs\! And they were all so big\! Their boss could climb trees to hide, but what about them?

"Ahhh —"

Right at this moment, the hyena queen suddenly called out and personally led the hyena army out of the bushes in a majestic manner, chasing after the Chino brothers\!

Nearly a hundred hyenas followed behind with a murderous aura\!

The Chino brothers immediately peed their pants in fear. As they ran, they ran in fear\!

Chu Xiaoye climbed on the tree and looked coldly at the hyena queen.

Obviously, the other party might have heard from his cry that he was protecting the Chino brothers. Therefore, they deliberately chased the Chino brothers to lure him out of the bushes.

Once he reached the grassland without trees, he would immediately be surrounded by the hyenas and there would be no trees to jump or dodge\!

They could only fight to the death\!

"Roar—"

The terrified cries of the Chino brothers came from the grassland.

They had already exhausted too much energy when hunting just now. In a moment, they were caught up by the hyenas and surrounded.

Chu Xiaoye crawled on the tree and did not move.

The hyena queen turned her head and looked at him cunningly. She suddenly rushed in front of the Chino brothers and suddenly grabbed Big Chino's head\!

When Little Chino was about to open its mouth to bite, it had already retreated\!

Big Chino let out a scream and his head was immediately dripping with blood and badly mutilated\!

The hyena queen turned around and looked coldly at the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze collided with it. He could clearly feel the ridicule and taunting in its eyes.

This was definitely not an emotion a hyena should have\!

"Ahhh —"

The hyena queen suddenly growled.

Five of the spotted hyenas surrounding them immediately jumped out of the crowd and pounced at the Chino brothers, starting to bite.

The Chino brothers were already trembling in fear and could not stand steadily. They could only fight with their backs against each other and open their fangs to retaliate\!

However, two fists could not defeat four hands\!

Soon, they were covered in wounds and dripping with blood from the bites of the five strong hyenas.

Just as the two brothers were terrified and in despair, an angry roar suddenly sounded from the bushes\!

"Roar—"

Their king and their boss suddenly rushed out of the bushes like a bolt of lightning\!

His speed was so fast, his aura was so brave, and his gaze was so determined\!

His body was not as big as theirs, but he did not hesitate and charged straight at this dense group of ferocious enemies\!

The fear in the Chino brothers' hearts suddenly turned into enthusiasm and gratitude.

"Roar—"

They suddenly roared angrily, jumped up, and pounced ferociously at this group of despicable and cunning enemies\!

However, this group of enemies ignored them.

The moment Chu Xiaoye rushed out of the bushes, the hyenas quickly dispersed at the hyena queen's signal\!

When Chu Xiaoye rushed close, he was already surrounded by the hyenas. Round after round, the encirclement was almost airtight\!

Under the hyena queen's cries, these strong hyenas did not give him any time to rest. They immediately bared their fangs and pounced on him\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye waved his claws and instantly cut off the jaws and half of the hyenas' faces\!

The other hyenas also took the opportunity to surge forward. When he attacked, they pounced from his side and back and started biting fiercely.

A female hyena charged forward and bent her legs, lying on the ground, preparing to attack his lower body\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his hind leg and kicked its eye, causing her eyeball to explode and roll out\!

At the same time, his back and butt were bitten fiercely\!

Before the hyenas' fangs could close, he had already jumped up and twisted his body to counterattack. Golden light flashed from his claws and he cut their necks like a sharp blade\!

However, when he landed, his thigh and neck were bitten by the other hyenas that rushed up again\!

The surrounding hyenas were densely packed and pounced forward. There was no room to stand and dodge\!

No matter which direction he went, there was a ferocious bloody mouth with bared fangs\!

The intense pain made the blood in Chu Xiaoye's body flow even faster. The strange heat in his abdomen also quickly surged throughout his body\!

His strength increased explosively again\!

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly swung his claws and quickly circled around in place\!

The sharp claws that were flickering with golden light were extremely sharp. They cut off the mouths of the surrounding hyenas\!

Blood sprayed and miserable cries rang out endlessly\!

When the hyenas fell to the ground and rolled, the hyenas behind immediately surged forward and continued to open their mouths to bite\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up. After jumping six to seven meters away, he landed in another circle of hyenas\!

However, the hyenas did not react completely.

The moment Chu Xiaoye landed, he swung his claws and tore off half of the hyenas' faces\!

When the spotted hyenas around him reacted and opened their mouths to pounce on him, he jumped up again and landed in another group of spotted hyenas\!

The golden claws swung and blood splashed\!

Another few spotted hyenas lay on the ground and let out miserable cries.

The hyena queen stood in place and did not move. She only silently directed her subordinates to continue attacking and biting him.

Obviously, it was exhausting his energy.

Chu Xiaoye used a jumping method to kill a few more spotted hyenas. The other spotted hyenas reacted and opened their mouths to be vigilant\!

When he jumped up again, before he landed, the hyenas raised their heads and bared their sharp teeth\!

A few strong female hyenas even jumped up and pounced at him in the air\!

Chu Xiaoye swung his claws and cut open the heads of the female hyenas. However, when he landed, countless mouths bit down ferociously\!

Intense pain instantly assaulted him from all over his body\!

He could only clamp his legs together, lower his tail, and quickly lower his body to protect his back and abdomen\!

At the same time, his claws and sharp teeth immediately counterattacked\!

In an instant, his entire body was covered in wounds and dripping with blood\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and his claws, which had suddenly become extremely hot, grabbed at a circle of hyenas with a whoosh\!

With a whoosh, the blood of the hyenas that were biting his body crazily sprayed and their entire necks fell\!

The six spotted hyenas that were surrounding and biting froze and fell into a pool of blood, their corpses separating from their heads\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye realized that his claws had become a few centimeters longer\!

Those golden claws flickered with a cold and charming luster under the bright moonlight\!

At this moment, he also realized that he seemed to have suddenly grown a little taller and could see further and more clearly\!

At the same time.

The moment he roared, the female cub, who was traveling with the cute violent bear and her son two kilometers away, immediately trembled and ran out with a whoosh\!

She was even faster and flew towards the grassland like a meteor in the night\!

In the blink of an eye, the cute violent bear mother and son pair could no longer see her\!
