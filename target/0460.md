Chapter 460: Untitled

The night retreated.

A ray of sunlight shone in through the gaps in the dense leaves and landed in Chu Xiaoye's flickering golden eyes. It also plated the dazzling mane on his neck with a golden luster.

The bird's feathers fell to the ground.

Peace had already returned to the giant tree.

Chu Xiaoye did not see or smell anything else.

The amber mucus on the thick tree trunk was like a crystalline and beautiful armor. It was overflowing with light and was indestructible.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but try touching it with his claws again. It was still so sticky that he suspected lion life. He had no choice but to give up the thought of continuing to climb.

What was hiding on the huge tree with dense leaves and clouds?

He was curious, but he could only restrain himself for the time being.

He had to stabilize his footing here and confirm this territory first. Then, he would settle the matters here.

He did not sleep the entire night and did not feel sleepy at all.

When the little girl woke up, she realized that she was sleeping on the ground with a shocked and confused expression.

She remembered that she had clearly slept in the tree hole above last night. Why did she suddenly come to the ground? Did the king dislike her and deliberately bring her down?

Her aggrieved eyes looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was resting at the entrance of the tree hole with his eyes closed.

However, Chu Xiaoye ignored her.

The little girl got up, walked in front of the ladder, and climbed up it. Her movements were surprisingly relaxed and agile. She no longer had the carefulness and clumsiness from before.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and looked at her, secretly shocked.

This little girl's body was clearly still changing and her courage seemed to have increased.

"King, I clearly slept in the cave last night. Did you throw me down?"

The little girl walked in front of him and pouted.

A faint fragrance emitted from her body and entered Chu Xiaoye's nose.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he looked up at her. This little girl was wearing a white dress, and she had golden hair and blue eyes. Her skin was like snow. In this dark world filled with wild beasts, she was like a pure white flower, fresh, pure, beautiful, and fragrant. She emitted a unique aura and smell.

"I knew it was you\! Hmph\! Petty\!"

Seeing that he did not answer, the little girl thought that he had tacitly agreed. She snorted and walked into the cave angrily. She sat down with her back facing him and wrapped her arms around herself, ignoring him. She seemed to be angry and also seemed to be reflecting on herself on the wall.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and looked at her, then looked up, his eyes flickering.

The sticky liquid on this little girl previously should have been left behind by the robber. In other words, the other party had already visited here two nights in a row.

From the looks of it, the temptation on this little girl was really not small. The other party seemed to be determined to get it.

Then, he would just wait here. There was no need to risk being stuck on the tree and investigate the giant tree.

"Hmph, I'm angry\!"

Seeing that he was still ignoring her, the little girl finally could not help but turn around and remind him angrily.

"Then continue to be angry."

Chu Xiaoye replied in his heart, then got up and jumped down.

It was dawn. He should bring the team out and patrol and mark his territory.

His requirements were not high. With this super tree as the center, a radius of 50 square kilometers was enough. After all, the vegetation here was lush and there were many herbivores. It was enough for them to survive and reproduce.

As for the imagined 30 square kilometers, it was clearly a little small.

"Roarâ€”"

He landed on the ground and roared loudly, waking the members of the pride who were sleeping and telling them that it was time to get up and divide the territory.

If he wanted to successfully divide the territory, he would naturally have to have conflicts with the other nearby tribes. Furthermore, this territory might have long had an owner. At that time, he would definitely have to use force to resolve it.

At this time, it was time for all the members of the pride to contribute. Only in this way would it seem that this territory had not been easy to obtain and make them love and cherish this land more.

This land would become the glory and home of all their members\!

The leopard family of four, the three-headed warthog, and Brother Flat Top, Little Mi, heard his roar and crawled out of the cave, standing neatly beside him.

With him as the center, the members of the pride bared their fangs and claws. They ground their fists excitedly.

"Let's go\!"

Seeing that everyone was here, Chu Xiaoye immediately growled and walked out.

At this moment, the human girl's voice suddenly came from above. "King\! Wait for me\! Wait for me\! Annie is going too\!"

As she spoke, she hurriedly rushed out of the tree hole. Then, she suddenly jumped down and actually jumped down from above\!

Her pure white dress bloomed like a lotus flower. Her golden hair fluttered like silk and she fluttered like a butterfly.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. Just as he was about to jump up and catch her, he suddenly realized that the big black bear had already stood below at some point in time. Furthermore, it was standing upright, revealing its tall and strong body\!

"Bam\!"

The little girl's snow-white feet happened to step on the big black bear's head. Then, she slid down and rode steadily on its neck, sliding down its neck to its back.

The big black bear was extremely tacit and its upper body immediately landed.

In this way, the little girl rode steadily on its wide back.

From the moment she rushed out of the tree hole, jumped down, and rode on the big black bear's back, the entire process was like flowing water. It was completed in one go without any pause or tilt, precise and agile, as if she had practiced it countless times.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew clearly that this was definitely the first time\!

Then, this was terrifying.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the mighty and strong black bear in shock, then at the little girl riding on its back. He was stunned in place.

The little girl's change was really beyond his expectations. Not only was he impressed, he was also shocked.

"King, what's wrong?"

Little Annie opened her beautiful blue eyes and looked at him strangely, as if she did not remember what she had just done.

If they were placed together at such a high place, she would definitely cry from fright even if she stood at the edge. Now, she almost did not hesitate or fear and jumped down easily.

"Little demon\!"

Chu Xiaoye muttered to himself and ignored her. He turned around and walked in front, but he was secretly thinking. Which part of the little girl attracted the thing on the tree? Things definitely did not seem simple.

The big black bear was treated as a mount, but it narrowed its eyes with a look of enjoyment.

No one realized that the little girl's two little ears hidden in her golden hair had become a little sharp at some point in time.
