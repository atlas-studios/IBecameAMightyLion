Chapter 292: The King of Giant Mosquitoes

"Buzz —"

Unexpectedly, just as the mosquitoes approached Chu Xiaoye and Tilly, they suddenly stopped in midair, as if they were puzzled about something.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to fart and defend, the mosquitoes suddenly changed directions and flew towards the five black bears with a buzz.

Black bears had thick skin and rough flesh. They were not even afraid of poisonous bees, so why would they be afraid of these small mosquitoes?

When the five black bears saw the mosquitoes flying over, they ignored them and casually raised their front paws to wave them a few times. They roared and rushed towards Chu Xiaoye and Tilly.

They had to take such a big pile of honey for themselves\!

The mosquitoes immediately landed on their thick fur and covered their entire bodies and heads.

There were also more mosquitoes that landed, but they ignored Chu Xiaoye and Tilly and rushed towards the five black bears.

When black bears ate honey in the wild, they would ignore it even if they were covered in poisonous bees and constantly stung with bee stingers, let alone such small mosquitoes.

Therefore, they completely ignored the mosquitoes on them. They bared their fangs and pounced ferociously at Chu Xiaoye and Tilly.

The five black bears were huge and extremely strong. They charged together aggressively and looked like lions.

Chu Xiaoye and Tilly retreated for the time being and widened the distance. They prepared to use their speed to deal with them one by one.

However, the five black bears did not chase after them anymore. Just as they ran in front of the pile of honey, they immediately lowered their bodies and started eating greedily.

Suddenly, a black bear swayed a few times and fell to the ground with a bang.

Then, its strong and huge body quickly shriveled like a leaking balloon\!

It still stuck out its tongue and licked the honey on the ground mechanically, as if it did not have the time to know what was happening.

However, its body was already quickly drying up.

In the blink of an eye, it only had a thick layer of fur and withered muscles left. It had completely turned into a dry corpse\!

As for the mosquito crawling all over its body, it was originally only the size of half a thumb. Now, after quickly sucking it dry, its body actually swelled up, and every one of them became the size of a sparrow\!

"Smack\! Smack\!"

The remaining four black bears also fell to the ground one after another.

Then, their strong and huge bodies quickly shriveled.

Before they could struggle, they instantly turned into dried corpses like the first black bear\!

The mosquitoes that covered their bodies also quickly grew and turned into terrifying giant mosquitoes the size of sparrows\!

The leading giant mosquito was even more terrifying. It was as big as a turtledove and the mouthpiece on its head was long and sharp, like a syringe's needle.

"Buzz —"

They flew up one after another and circled above the dried corpses of the five black bears. Then, under the lead of the giant mosquito leader, they flew towards Chu Xiaoye and Tilly.

Tilly, whose eyes had just lit up and was preparing to fight Chu Xiaoye, was actually trembling in fear. She leaned tightly against Chu Xiaoye. When she saw the terrifying giant mosquitoes flying over, she immediately lay on the ground and crawled under Chu Xiaoye's body, trembling violently.

The scene of the five black bears instantly turning into dried corpses terrified her.

Chu Xiaoye was also terrified. Seeing the terrifying giant mosquitoes flying over, he immediately raised his tail and prepared to fart.

If smelly farts were useless against these giant mosquitoes, he could only abandon the female cub under him and escape first.

He did not want to be sucked dry by these perverted things\!

"Buzz…"

Unexpectedly, under the lead of the leader, the group of giant mosquitoes suddenly stopped when they were only a meter away from him. They flapped their wings and stopped in midair, neat and tidy, as if they were hesitating about something.

Chu Xiaoye's muscles were tense. He raised his tail and prepared to spray the most violent black smoke at any time.

However, this group of ferocious and terrifying giant mosquitoes was surprisingly quiet. They did not attack aggressively like before. Instead, they stopped in midair and looked at him uniformly.

This black mass gave Chu Xiaoye a lot of pressure.

Just as he could not resist and was about to take the initiative to attack, the giant mosquito leader suddenly flew up with the group of giant mosquitoes and actually let them go and left\!

Chu Xiaoye was stunned in place as he looked up at their retreating figures. His tail was still curled up and his limbs were a little limp. His eyes were filled with shock.

Tilly crawled out from under him and shook the fur on her body. She looked up and turned her head to look at him. Finally, she leaned behind his butt to take a look and praised him inwardly.

"The fart of the smelly fart king is indeed powerful\! He scared the enemy away before he could attack\!"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye retreated and kicked her in the face, causing her to fall to the ground. Then, he quickly lowered his raised tail.

Brother Flat Top cowered under a rock at the side and looked at him in fear. He did not dare to escape again.

The five strong black bears had all become dried corpses, and the group of terrifying killers had been frightened away by this young lion. From this, it could be seen that this young lion was the most terrifying fellow.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the corpses of the five black bears and extended his claws. He flipped them and realized that the flesh inside had been sucked clean. There was not a trace left, only a layer of fur and bones were left\!

The muscles that had withered at the beginning were actually melted into juice by the venom of the mosquitoes and sucked clean with the blood\!

What a terrifying group of killers\!

The mutations of those mosquitoes were even more powerful and perverted than these ferocious beasts.

Indeed, the positions in the biological chain had to start changing.

A small mosquito had such terrifying strength. There were probably more creatures that had mutated even more terrifyingly.

Chu Xiaoye only realized today what it meant by there was always a higher mountain.

No matter how strong a ferocious beast was, it was probably impossible to guard against this group of little things. There was no way to dodge them. No matter how sharp their fangs and claws were, they could not do anything to them.

However, why did these terrifying mosquitoes not attack him and Tilly?

Of course, it could not be because of his farts.

He had yet to release it.

Just as he was looking at the corpses of the five black bears, Little Curly Tail rushed over with his team.

When they saw the shriveled corpses of the five black bears, everyone widened their eyes in disbelief. They thought that it was done by this young king.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to explain to them. He immediately instructed them to leave quickly with the remaining honey.

If those mosquitoes returned, it would be troublesome.

Their powerful combat strength could not be displayed in front of those little things. They could only flee. At that time, many of their companions would definitely have their flesh and blood sucked dry and become dried corpses.

He did not want to see that happen.

Tilly did not dare to stay any longer. She immediately picked up a stick of honey and walked in front.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Brother Flat Top, who was hiding under the rock. Just as he was about to tell this fellow that he was free, Brother Flat Top suddenly ran over, took the initiative to bite a stick of honey, and followed behind the team eagerly.

It was terrified by the scene just now.

It no longer dared to run around alone in the forest. If it encountered those terrifying mosquitoes, it would be dead. It was safer to follow the golden-haired lion king.

Seeing how eager the little fellow was, Chu Xiaoye did not let it leave. He immediately picked up the honey and brought the team down the mountain.

Not long after they left, the mosquitoes suddenly flew back.

The giant mosquito leader landed at the place Chu Xiaoye had just stood. He searched carefully and suddenly discovered a strand of fur. Then, he grabbed that strand of fur and left with the giant mosquito swarm.

They followed the mountain range and flew south.

Soon, they flew over the mountain range and a green grassland appeared below.

Then, they flew over the grassland and arrived at a new land.

The ground was filled with dilapidated human houses, and smoke was still coming from many places. It was grayish-white everywhere. Broken walls and trash flew everywhere, like a ruin.

The giant mosquito leader brought the team and slowly landed in the middle of the ruins.

"Buzz —"

Then, a group of even larger mosquitoes flew up. They were black and covered the sky.

Those giant mosquitoes were several times larger than the previous giant mosquito leader.

The giant mosquito leader immediately stopped in midair, and its wings trembled at a frequency, emitting a strange language sound wave.

"Moo—"

The scream of a water buffalo suddenly came from the ground\!

Then, the huge water buffalo instantly turned into a dried corpse and fell to the ground.

In the sky, the black mass of giant mosquitoes was like dark clouds that were lined up neatly.

A huge mosquito king nearly two meters long flew up from the ground and came in front of the giant mosquito leader. It reached out with its sharp claws.

The giant mosquito leader lowered its head and respectfully handed the fur to the claw. Its wings flapped quickly, as if it was eagerly reporting something.

The giant mosquito king lowered its head to look at the fur on its claws and listened quietly. Its mouth, which was as sharp as a spear, trembled slightly, as if it was thinking about something or recalling something.

After a long time, the giant mosquito leader lowered its head and left.

The giant mosquito king's wings did not move, but it floated steadily in midair.

It was silent for a moment before it suddenly raised its claws and pressed the fur on the mouthpiece. It swung its head and actually sucked the fur in.

"Buzz…"

It flapped its wings comfortably and circled back and forth in midair, as if it was drunk. It was excited and engrossed, entering a state of selflessness.

The black mass of giant mosquitoes circled around and quietly lowered their heads in fear, not daring to look at it.

"Roar—"

On the ground not far away, strange roars suddenly came.

A group of human-like figures with bloodshot eyes were shaking their heads and walking over with their bodies dripping with blood.

The giant mosquito king suddenly stopped and looked down at the group of flesh that had long lost their lives.

"Buzz —"

It issued an order.

A group of giant mosquitoes pounced over.

All flesh in this world was their food\!

Including these walking corpses that were about to occupy the human world\!
