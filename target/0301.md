Chapter 301: Lion King's Fist

"Roar—"

An angry roar broke the silence of the night.

A few lions patrolling nearby discovered the white figure and immediately rushed over.

Tilly still swaggered forward, seemingly ignoring them.

Suddenly, a roar came from the bushes in front of him.

The few lions that were roaring angrily at Tilly immediately stopped in place. They were stunned and turned to leave.

In the bushes.

The young lion covered in golden fur personally welcomed them with the four guards and looked at the snow-white figure in front of him with a burning gaze.

Under the bright moonlight, her snow-white fur was spotless. She was like a flower that bloomed in the night, so charming.

Haas turned around and let the four guards behind him leave.

He walked towards the snow-white figure alone.

The four guards looked at Tilly and turned to return to the bushes.

Has's golden mane fluttered gently in the night wind, and his bright eyes were filled with gentleness.

He came in front of Tilly and lowered his head politely, looking extremely gentlemanly.

"Hello, my dear lady. What can I do for you? Just let me know."

He looked up, his eyes bright and sincere.

Tilly was a little shy, but she stared at him blankly, as if she was already confused by his handsome blond hair and polite aura.

The corner of Haas' mouth curled up as he walked close. He lowered his head and prepared to rub this beautiful little white lion's neck.

"Whoosh\!"

However, right at this moment, a golden light suddenly lit up in the night\!

Tilly's golden claws pierced through the golden mane on his neck and pierced into his skin with a whoosh\!

Blood flowed out.

The expression on Haas' face froze. He tilted his head and looked at her in shock.

Tilly's claws pierced through his neck, and her light blue eyes were filled with sincerity and gentleness.

"I'm the true king. However, I can't take away the smelly fart king's team. Therefore, I hope you can give me your team and let me be the king, okay?"

Her claws were covered in the blood of this young lion king, but her face was filled with a pitiful plea.

The muscles in Haas' eyes twitched a few times. He stared at her for dozens of seconds before nodding.

"Alright."

His neck had been pierced, but he still nodded easily. He did not roar or panic.

Tilly's heart suddenly sank as she realized that something was wrong.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as she was about to scratch his head, a black shadow suddenly appeared in her eyes and instantly approached\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

She was hit in the head and flew out diagonally.

When she was halfway there, she was shocked to discover that the black shadow that hit her head was actually the claw of this golden-haired lion\!

However, that claw actually clenched into a huge fist\!

She had never seen a lion that could turn its claws into such a strange shape\!

"Bang\!"

She fell heavily to the ground, feeling dizzy and her ears were buzzing. For a moment, she could not stand up.

The young golden-haired lion king slowly walked over and swung its neck. The wound pierced by her golden claw actually healed at a visible speed.

In the blink of an eye, the wound disappeared\!

If not for the fact that there was still blood on the fur nearby, no one would have thought that a fatal wound had appeared there just now\!

Tilly struggled a few times and got up from the ground. She looked at the young lion king in front of her in disbelief.

Hass came in front of her and did not seem to be angry with her rashness just now. He still looked at her gently and conversed politely.

"My dear lady, are you sure that you want to be a king? If you're sure, my team can be handed to you."

Tilly looked at him in shock, but she became even more vigilant.

Haas looked sincere and his gaze at her was gentle.

"My dear lady, I can hand this team to you. However, I hope you can help me make that team over there mine. Oh, I was wrong to say that. It will become ours."

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

Tilly attacked him again without mercy\!

"Bang\!"

However, this lion king's fist was faster than her claws\!

Tilly flew out again. This time, she was already prepared, so she landed steadily on the ground. However, her claw, which had been hit by the fist, felt numb.

The other party's strength was extremely terrifying.

Haas stood in place and narrowed his eyes. He still looked like a modest and refined gentleman.

"My dear lady, shouldn't you say pleasure working with you? That mixed fur little thing is not worthy of the favor of a noble white lion like you. If we kill him, these two teams will be ours. You can be the queen. I'm willing to be your subordinate. How about that?"

"Pui\!"

Tilly's answer was a mouthful of disdainful saliva.

"You're even more disgusting than the smelly fart king\! At least the smelly fart king did not dye his hair\!"

Tilly looked mockingly at the lush mane on the lion king's neck.

Haas was stunned for a moment before he turned around.

The fur that was dyed with blood around the place where the wound was scratched by Tilly's golden claw had actually lost its golden color and revealed its original appearance, turning into a dim gray.

It was not the silver ash that was filled with luster, but the lifeless and lusterless ash.

Tilly grinned and the ridicule in her eyes grew stronger.

"Roar—"

A hysterical roar suddenly sounded in the night\!

The young lion king, who had been polite and gentle just now, suddenly seemed to be stimulated by something. His face immediately distorted and he revealed his two sharp fangs\!

He roared angrily and charged towards Tilly crazily with endless hatred and anger\!

He would never allow his humiliation to be exposed\!

He wanted this beautiful and despicable little white lion to close its charming eyes that made him feel humiliated forever\!

"Whoosh\!"

He pounced over and suddenly smashed his fist at Tilly's head\!

This punch brought with it a strong wind that whistled past. It seemed to have a thousand kilograms of strength and killing intent surged\!

"Hehe, I was embarrassed and furious when I was discovered to be ugly."

Tilly's gaze was mocking as her figure flashed and she dodged.

She did not dare to take this fist head-on.

However, just as she dodged, the furious young lion king suddenly turned around and pounced forward again\!

"Bang\!"

Tilly could not dodge and could only swing her claws to fight.

A terrifying force smashed into her snow-white claws and sent her flying.

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

Her bones were broken.
