Chapter 91: The Seno brothers' pride

The roars were endless.

Seno seemed to want to use an angry and dignified roar to make the enemy retreat without a fight.

However, the enemy also used roars to continue provoking them.

As they walked fearlessly towards the camp of the Seno brothers' pride, they issued a challenge with their roars\!

They had three adult lions\!

When the female lions in the pride of the cold father heard this noise, they raised their heads in fear and looked at the bushes at the back.

Then, they looked at their king.

The cold father hesitated for a moment, then walked into the bushes with a grave expression.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei beside him.

Mei Mei seemed to be a little afraid and a trace of worry appeared in her eyes. She unconsciously leaned close to him.

As for Little Curly Tail, he looked a little excited. He could not wait to see the situation and did not look afraid.

This kid was getting bolder and bolder.

Those were three adult lions\!

Chu Xiaoye extended his claws and called out to them before turning around and walking towards the bushes at the back.

It was better to let them see some cruelty and blood in advance.

After all, a crisis had arrived.

The crisis of the Seno brothers' pride might soon become their crisis. They had to be mentally prepared.

The cold father stopped at the border and looked at the Seno brothers' pride with a deep gaze.

The five female lions in the Seno brothers' pride were all pregnant. They stood in the shade of the bushes, terrified.

Seno stood in front of them and continued to roar angrily.

However, the three wandering lions still walked over with their heads held high.

They walked together and did not run. Instead, they walked over slowly as if they were patrolling their territory.

Chu Xiaoye stood beside his cold father and watched this scene. He seemed to have seen the scene when the Seno brothers invaded this territory.

Back when their brothers invaded this territory and roared at Bill to provoke him, they were as rude and arrogant as this.

However, who could have thought that in just dozens of days, he would become the former "Bill" and become a challenged person.

Seno stopped roaring.

He turned around and looked at the five female lions behind him.

The female lions were all pregnant with his children.

If he lost or ran away, the children in the stomachs of these five female lions would die.

His body was trembling.

Fear and contradiction.

The other party had three adult lions, and he definitely had no chance of winning.

He could only flee.

He raised his head and looked at the three approaching wandering lions again. He suddenly bared his fangs and let out an angry roar\!

Out of all the lions' expectations, he actually charged towards the three wandering lions without hesitation\!

His mane fluttered and his gaze was determined. He looked ferocious and carried a ferocious aura of facing death with equanimity\!

The three wandering lions immediately stopped in their tracks, feeling a little stunned.

The five female lions behind him were also stunned.

They thought that he would run away without fighting like Bill did in the past.

After all, the other party was too strong and invincible.

However, not only did he not escape immediately, he even risked his life to charge up\!

The cold father, who was standing at the borders of the territory, took a few steps forward unconsciously and looked at the brave figure in disbelief.

He found it difficult to understand.

Chu Xiaoye, who was standing beside him, had his eyes flickering and his blood boiling\!

This was more like a man\!

He would rather die fighting for his wives and children\!

"Roar\!"

Seno roared angrily and jumped up, pouncing on a wandering lion\!

The battle started\!

The three wandering lions were furious and immediately surrounded him fiercely.

Seno did not care about the other two wandering lions, nor did he care about his back and side. Instead, he bit one of the wandering lions crazily, looking ferocious and crazy\!

The wandering lion was immediately bitten until its mouth was full of blood. It was also frightened by his fierce and terrifying appearance and ran away\!

Seno roared and chased\!

The other two wandering lions pounced on him from behind and bit him viciously.

In the end, he was outnumbered.

He was thrown to the ground.

The two wandering lions opened their bloody mouths and continued to attack ferociously\!

As for the fleeing wandering lion, its face was covered in blood. It stood there with lingering fear, not daring to return.

Seno was pressed to the ground, but he did not surrender. His entire body was covered in blood, and he was still biting crazily\!

A wandering lion attracted his sharp teeth, and another wandering lion ferociously bit at his abdomen\!

"Roar\!"

Right at this moment\!

One of the five pregnant female lions in the Seno brothers' pride pack suddenly roared and led the charge\!

When the other four female lions saw this, they immediately gathered their courage and roared as they rushed up\!

The sun was blazing and grass flew everywhere\!

The five female lions widened their stomachs, bared their fangs, and pounced bravely at the two wandering lions\!

The wandering lion that was preparing to sneak an attack on Seno's abdomen was shocked. It hurriedly jumped up and bared its bloody fangs at the five female lions, roaring angrily\!

Usually, at this time, female lions would be trembling in fear. They would either surrender or flee\!

However.

This time, he had miscalculated\!

He seemed to have forgotten that these five female lions were not just five smaller and weaker female lions.

They were also five mothers who were about to give birth\!

A woman was weak, but a mother was strong\!

His mother's courage and strength roared away like a tidal wave\!

For the sake of the children in their stomachs, they had nothing to fear\!

"Roar\!"

The five female lions pounced ferociously at the two wandering lions. Their eyes were red as they bit crazily\!

Seno could get up and roar angrily. He was covered in blood and continued to fight\!

The two wandering lions were soon terrified by this crazy pride and ran away\!

As for the wandering lion that was standing not far away and did not dare to come over, when it saw this scene, it did not dare to stay any longer and immediately fled in panic\!

Seno led the five pregnant lionesses and roared as they chased after the enemy\!

Soon, this crazy pride chased after the three fleeing wandering lions and disappeared into the distant grassland.

The cold father was dumbfounded.

At some point in time, the five female lions that had already arrived behind him also had blank gazes as they stood there motionless.

Some fixed thought in their minds seemed to be overturned by this unbelievable scene.

Was this the true pride?

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and looked at them, then at his father.

He wondered what they would do if they encountered such a situation.

Was he going to throw caution to the wind and fight to the death like Seno and the female lions did? Or was he going to flee without a fight, like Bill did in the past, and the female lions would just watch?

From what happened today.

Some rules could be changed.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked up at the distant grassland again.

Those three wandering lions might not let the matter rest.

The dry season was approaching. They had to find a new territory and lionesses. Otherwise, it would be difficult to survive.

They were defeated by the united and crazy Seno brothers' pride.

However, there was another pride that looked weaker next to the Seno brothers' pride.

They had once provoked him with their roars on the other side of the river.

Therefore, they should come again.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes. He stepped on the two front paws in the grass and suddenly felt a heat. Two sharp claws popped out.

Just come.

He was not afraid\!
