Chapter 340: Untitled

A female was so easy to coax.

Looking at the little white lion lowering its head and looking surprised and drunk, Chu Xiaoye could not help but sigh.

It was just a stone, but it was so charming. Be it humans or animals, as long as they were female, they could not bear to part with it.

Of course, the prerequisite was that you had to be full and bored.

Not far away.

Catherine turned around and left silently.

Chu Xiaoye did not disturb the little white lion anymore. He wandered around the nearby forest for a while and caught a wild rabbit. He made a sacrifice and returned to where Little Curly Tail and the others were recuperating.

After dark.

The surrounding forest became lively.

The black lion's corpse and the smell of blood attracted many carnivores.

After the pride ate and drank their fill, they did not disturb them again.

When Tilly returned with the pearl necklace, Chu Xiaoye was sleeping on the tree.

When she saw the pearl on her neck, Mei Mei's eyes turned red. Even Little Curly Tail, who was not interested in this stone at all at the beginning, became jealous.

His brother actually gave such a beautiful thing to this little white lion\!

Catherine lay at the side and looked at it silently. Then, she lowered her head and closed her eyes.

Mei Mei could not be bothered to heal her injuries in envy. She went to Tilly's side and rubbed against her with a fawning expression, wanting Tilly to take it off and put it on her for a while.

Of course, Tilly was unwilling. She was pleased with herself as she extended her claws and mimicked Chu Xiaoye. She rubbed her head like a big sister.

"Sister, this thing is not suitable for you. Only I can wear it."

Mei Mei cried out in grievance. She raised her head and looked at Chu Xiaoye on the tree, as if she was complaining about his favoritism.

"Brother is so biased. I like it too\!"

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes and could not be bothered with her.

Tilly was right. Only a little white lion like her was suitable to wear this.

Her fur was snow-white and the pearl on her neck was not out of place. It looked very natural and was not that conspicuous.

However, if Mei Mei wore it on her neck, it would be too conspicuous.

When female lions hunted, they relied on their skills and fur to disguise themselves. If you wore this thing, it would not match your skin color. Those prey could discover you from afar.

It was beautiful, but she would starve to death\!

Tilly climbed up the tree and came to his side. She reached out with her claws and touched his head. She opened her mouth to show that she liked this gift very much. She would let bygones be bygones.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her, but it landed on a branch at the side.

Tilly landed on another branch and bent her eyes. She bared her teeth at him and stuck out her tongue to show that she was prepared.

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes and ignored this fellow.

The next day.

Little Curly Tail and the others had recovered their strength and the wounds on their bodies were covered in scars.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to delay and immediately brought the team back.

The teams on the grassland should still be gathered and waiting for them to return.

More than seven hundred lions gathered together was definitely a disaster. Not to mention the conflict between them, the food they consumed every day was extremely terrifying.

Be it humans or animals, when they had an enemy, they might share a common enemy and work together. Once they lost an enemy, they would compete and kill each other.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye had to rush back as soon as possible and make a decision.

They set off in the morning and finally crossed the desert and the grassland in the evening to the river.

The evening sun dyed the river water orange. Many animals drank water by the river, and there was no fighting or killing between them.

However, danger was everywhere, and killing did not come only from beside and behind.

"Whoosh\!"

In the river, waves splashed. A huge crocodile opened its bloody mouth and suddenly broke out of the water, biting the mouth of a zebra.

Before the zebra could break free, it was dragged into the water by a huge force and struggled with all its might, neighing in fear.

The other animals on the shore fled in panic.

When the zebra stopped moving in the water, these animals surrounded it again and continued to drink water.

The crocodile was not the only one hiding in the river.

Everyone was terrified, but they did not leave. They all carefully carried the hope that they were lucky and that they were not the ones being attacked and eaten. They even hoped that their companions would be dragged away so that they could fight for a chance to drink water.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team to the river and saw many crocodiles floating in the river. He did not hesitate and jumped into the water to open the path in front.

He could jump over, but not the other members behind him.

The movement of jumping into the water attracted the attention of the nearest crocodile.

The two giant crocodiles immediately swayed their tails and sank into the water, hiding over.

Then, in the next second, they were cut open and sent flying.

Tilly was surprisingly excited and worked hard. Before Chu Xiaoye could do anything, she dived into the water to kill these crocodiles, as if the pearl necklace on her neck had given her a new magical strength.

To crocodiles, hippopotamuses were their big brothers and could not be provoked. Elephants and rhinoceroses were not to be trifled with. As for lions, they would not take the initiative to provoke them most of the time.

Especially the hot-tempered and strong lion.

Their animal instincts and long survival experience told them that those with claws and sharp teeth were not to be trifled with.

Even in the water, they would not have a 100% chance of winning. If they took the risk of their skin being cut by the other party's claws and sharp teeth and were injured, there would only be death.

After Tilly killed the two blind giant crocodiles, the other crocodiles in the river smelled the smell of blood and immediately surrounded her.

However, when they saw Chu Xiaoye swimming in the water with a group of strong lions and a murderous aura, they immediately stopped in place and did not dare to move forward.

Until the last lion came ashore, the ferocious underwater killers did not dare to take a step forward.

The animals drinking water at the river also fled and retreated into the distance.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride ashore and walked up the hill. He raised his head and roared at the grassland.

Soon, the roars received a response. All sorts of roars rose and fell.

Like ten thousand horses galloping, the ground trembled. More than seven hundred lions ran over majestically and excitedly, almost occupying the entire grassland in his vision.

The animals by the river changed their expressions and were terrified.

The giant crocodiles in the river immediately sank into the water and disappeared.

When the pride surged over like a tide and saw the dense golden fur on their young king's neck, they were shocked and admired and respected him even more.

This was a king chosen by the heavens for them\!

Without him, they were still wandering around like stray dogs. They had no home to return to, lived in fear, and were even killed.

Now, not only did they take revenge for their pride, they had also regained their home. They no longer had to live a wandering life that could result in death at any time.

This was all thanks to this young king.

Therefore, this was the first lion king that made them submit willingly.

However, no one realized the danger, nor did anyone expect so many members to gather or consider how they would survive. They were still immersed in the joy of victory.

Chu Xiaoye looked at their excited and respectful gazes and did not hesitate. He immediately instructed Lars, One-eyed, and Blue Eyes to start disbanding the team.

They returned to their homes and looked for their mothers.

They had to return to their former territory, live their previous lives, and follow their previous rules again.

It was still the lionesses hunting, the lion fighting, and the cubs playing.

They had won, but life had to continue.

The reproduction and continuation of the pride still needed them.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he decided to stay in his former territory for a few days with the pride of the cold father. After Little Curly Tail and the others recovered from their injuries, he would leave and go to the other side of the mountain.

The black lions had already been killed or expelled. The mission on his shoulders was completed.

Now, it was time to think about his home.

After the sky turned dark, a cool wind blew on the grassland with a humid and rotten smell.

There was no moon tonight.

A few kilometers away from the edge of the grassland, there were two jeeps running at high speed. Behind them was a group of red-eyed monsters that were also continuing to run.

The former territory did not seem to have changed much.

After the pride reluctantly dispersed, Chu Xiaoye brought the pride of the cold father, as well as Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, and the others back to the territory where they were once born and grew up.

The two Baobab trees grew taller and lusher.

The black lions had once occupied this grassland. In order to survive and reproduce, they did not destroy anything. Even prey did not dare to hunt much.

However, everything seemed to have succeeded, but it suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Cruel competition was not limited to animals. Since ancient times, it was the law of evolution for all creatures to survive.

The failure of the black lions did not make Chu Xiaoye happy and pleased. Instead, it made him even more respectful and careful of nature.

Perhaps one day, they would suddenly disappear in the long river of history like those black lions.

Therefore, he had to be respectful at all times.

While Chu Xiaoye was thinking about something on the Baobab tree, the cold father under the tree was also looking at the night sky, thinking about something and looking disappointed.

His old companions left. Some went in groups, while others went to their former home.

The massacre of the black lions made many lions disappear from this grassland. These old lions, who had been chased out of their homes, really wanted to return to their hometown before dying. If they could die there, it would be a good home.

Although Chu Xiaoye did not take the initiative to chase them away, they knew that this land did not belong to them. And the cruel competition would never disappear because of their former unity.

The black lion had lost. The grassland was still the grassland, and the competition was still competition. Between the lions, the territory, and the pride, it would still be filled with blood.

Although the cold father could not bear to leave, he very soberly did not ask him to stay. He only felt a little sad about the glory that had passed away and the feeling of being admired and respected by many of his own kind.

Now, everything had returned to the past.

In the entire pride of the cold father, he only dared to roar at the female lion, Callie, a few times. He only dared to bare his teeth at the young cubs, Nunu, and Qiqi and teach them a lesson secretly.

How sad was it for a dignified lion king?

Of course, he was sad and indignant. This life was much more stable and comfortable for him than in the past.

When the few unfilial sons of the past did not dare to disobey him, he would patrol everywhere and chase away other carnivores. Every once in a while, he would fight other competitors. He was depressed and tense all day, and there was a possibility of him being defeated and escaping or dying at any time. He would often be hungry and worried.

Thinking about it, life at that time was really not like a lion's.

Now, this was life.

Although he would occasionally be bullied, it was a hundred times better than the days when he was not full and could not sleep well.

Furthermore, he was still in his prime and could enjoy it slowly for many years.

However, this pride seemed to be a little too weak.

He did not mean strength, but quantity.

The cold father raised his head and looked at the two unfilial sons on the tree. Seeing that the two unfilial sons were sleeping soundly and were not worried about the pride of the cold father, he immediately sighed.

It seemed that he could only rely on him for the time being.

The cold father stood up and walked towards Callie. Without any explanation, he pressed her into the grass.

Callie's roar woke up everyone on the tree and under the tree.

The cold father deliberately raised his head and looked at the two unfilial sons on the tree with a provocative expression, as if he wanted to provoke the male hormones of these two unfilial sons and make them immediately take action to be a true lion\!

However, Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail only looked down at it and felt bored. They continued to close their eyes and sleep.

On the other hand, Mei Mei, Tilly, Molly, and Catherine, who was lying in the grass not far away, widened their eyes and watched intently. They were inexplicably restless.

"Hmphâ¦ Hmphâ¦"

In the cave at the side, the warthog Pit was also restless. It immediately crawled out of the cave and crawled into the bushes at the back, preparing to find his lover.

Blue Eyes and the rest dutifully patrolled the borders of the surrounding territory.

This night was an unforgettable night for many lions on the grassland.

After leaving the team, they were nervous, hesitant, and excited to be reborn. When he returned to his former home and saw the desolate and empty territory, he could only be dejected and worry about his future survival.

However, being able to survive was lucky. He had to continue working hard.

When the sky was about to brighten, the roar of mixed fur suddenly came from the southern border of the pride of the cold father.

The roar of the alarm instantly spread throughout the territory of the pride of the cold father.

Chu Xiaoye woke up and did not jump down the tree immediately. Instead, he quickly climbed up the top of the tree. His eyes flickered with golden light as he looked up.

His gaze clearly pierced through the night and saw the mixed fur at the border.

On the grassland a mile away from the mixed fur, two human jeeps drove over with big lights on. They staggered and tilted.

Behind the two jeeps was a group of scarlet-eyed things running extremely quickly, as if they were chasing them.

Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped down from the tree and ran over. He let out an emergency roar and let the mixed fur and the others retreat.

The weapons of humans were not something they could stop.
