Chapter 505: The Queen's Tactician

On both sides of the cliff, the ice was warm.

The strong orcs were not afraid of the cold and worked feverishly in the snow.

They cut trees, built bridges, and roared to demonstrate their might.

On the contrary, the elves were surprisingly quiet.

Queen Lanisi brought the remaining thousand plus elves to the valley near the cliff.

On both sides of the valley were lofty mountain ranges that pierced into the sky. The environment on them was terrible. Even pterodactyls could not fly over them.

Therefore, the only path to Elf City was this narrow valley.

As long as they protected this place, their home would never be trampled and destroyed by the enemy\!

Even if they were left alone, they would never let those cruel enemies step into their city\!

The Elf City was their home, their honor, and the holy land they had protected with their lives for generations. They could not allow any enemy to taint it\!

"As long as we're in the city, we'll die\!"

This was what all the elves were thinking at this moment.

Before leaving the city, Lanisi had already been determined to die.

She kept fire seeds in the city and guarded them with ten people. Even if the orcs killed all of them, they could forget about entering their city\!

At that time, the raging flames would bury their corpses with the Elf City.

Lanisi brought the guards to the edge of the cliff.

The orcs on the other side of the cliff roared even more excitedly. Some even took off their pants and revealed their male symbols to express their excitement and humiliate the female elves.

When they attacked this elf city, if nothing went wrong, all the elf girls in the city would become their mating dolls and fertility tools.

Their descendants would become stronger.

At that time, they would bring endless hatred and powerful strength to kill all humans\!

Lanisi stood at the edge of the cliff, the cold wind blowing her fiery red hair that reached her butt. The armor on her body outlined her perfect figure. Her face was calm and she looked opposite coldly. She did not lose her mind because of the orcs' provocation.

A row of flames lit up on the other side, like a twisting fire dragon.

In order to let the elven girls on the other side see more clearly, the orcs raised the flames in their hands. As they roared, they twisted their bodies and looked very excited and pleased.

Half of the ice bridge was broken.

The remaining half had already been pulled up by the elf guard, like a huge ice pillar that stood in the sky.

Thick ropes wrapped around the winch and firmly fixed the heavy ice bridge.

The elf guard, Bamo, who had been stationed here all year round, came to Lanisi's side and whispered, "Your Majesty, should we cut off the entire ice bridge?"

Lanisi said without hesitation, "Cut it off. It's useless to keep it."

They no longer had to go out. Perhaps they would never have that chance again.

Bamo agreed and prepared to leave.

Lanisi suddenly thought of something and said, "Wait."

Then, the Queen turned around and looked at the lion behind her. "Night, what do you think?"

Since she had a tactician, he should be given the respect he deserved.

Even for these small matters, she should ask for his opinion first.

In the end, Chu Xiaoye said, "I think that if it's cut off, it would be an idiot's action."

The moment that was said, the elf guard, Bamo, was furious.

Vilis also said angrily, "Don't be rude to Her Majesty\!"

Lanisi was only stunned for a moment before she humbly sought advice. "Night, tell me, why can't it be cut off? The orcs will be coming soon. This ice bridge has already become useless, right?"

Chu Xiaoye said, "Your Majesty, if the orcs come over, how many can you kill with a sword alone?"

Lanisi pondered for a moment before saying, "If there are no archers, I can kill at most thirty."

"Impressive. Your Majesty is indeed impressive."

Chu Xiaoye first praised her and then said, "Then, what about your subordinates, such as this guard Bamo?"

Bamo was stunned for a moment, not knowing what he meant. However, under the Queen's gaze, he hurriedly answered, "I can kill at most three."

Chu Xiaoye nodded and praised him too. "It's already not bad."

Then, he raised his head and looked at the raised ice bridge at the edge of the cliff. He said in a low voice, "But Your Majesty, if you don't cut this ice bridge for the time being, it can kill at least 100 or 200 orcs."

Lanisi turned around and looked at him with bright eyes.

Chu Xiaoye continued, "Furthermore, we will let the bridge that the other party painstakingly built be destroyed instantly and buy more time for the elves."

Now, he finally knew why the elves had ended up in such a situation.

â€” Too stupid\!

Of course, the orcs who built the new bridge at the place where the ice bridge broke were even more stupid.

It seemed that there was a reason why their two tribes were pressed to the ground by humans.

The queen was still very smart.

After Chu Xiaoye said that he would instantly destroy the bridge that the other party had painstakingly built, she looked up at the ice bridge and immediately understood.

"Night, you're too smart\!"

For the first time today, the Queen smiled the purest smile of a young girl. She even extended her hand and rubbed his head. Her eyes were bright as she said, "Thank you."

Chu Xiaoye sighed inwardly.

This was not because he was too smart, but because they were too obsessed with fighting head-on and fighting with all their might. They did not think of anything else.

From this, it could be seen that the elves were a very pure tribe.

As for the orc opposite him, he was not simple. His limbs were too developed and his head was squeezed flat.

The reason why they were so eager to mate with elves was probably not just to let their descendants have stronger bodies, but also to let their descendants become smarter.

However, they never would have thought that the elves were as stupid as them.

If they combined stupidity, they might become smarter, but it was more possible that they would become more stupid.

They could completely change elves to humans.

However, with their hatred for humans, it was impossible for them to have descendants with humans. They would not even think about it.

"Night, do you have any other suggestions?"

Lanisi looked at him, her eyes bright, as if she had discovered a treasure. Her joy was overflowing.

Her attitude was also very humble.

Actually, even if she did not do this, in order to survive, Chu Xiaoye had no choice but to rack his brains and do his best to help them win this battle.

"Do you have more archers?"

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light that could penetrate the night and see the orc army opposite clearly.

Lanisi nodded and said, "There are still more than 100\. A few of them are little girls. However, they have all received personal guidance from Denise and are not inferior to other archers."

Chu Xiaoye said, "Where are they now?"

Lanisi looked behind and said, "They're all hiding on the hill on both sides of the valley. They're preparing to shoot from above when the orcs come and fight us."

"Good plan\!"

Chu Xiaoye praised.

Lanisi seemed a little embarrassed, but she was very happy. Just as she was about to be modest, she heard him say, "But it's useless."

The smile on Lanisi's face froze.

Chu Xiaoye pretended not to see and said, "Call them down and guard the cliff. Let the warriors use their shields to protect them. At the beginning of the battle, we have to attack with our aura, destroy the enemy's aura, and raise our aura. That way, we will be braver in the battle. Their arrows will make the enemies on the bridge more excited than their roars now\!"

Lanisi did not hesitate and immediately instructed Denise, who was beside her, to call the archers over personally.

After Denise left, Vilis, who was beside her, could not help but say, "You also said that you have to show your aura at the beginning of the battle. The orcs' initial attack will definitely be very fast and fierce. Didn't you let the archers suitable for long-range combat stand at the front to die? I think only the sword in your hand can show your aura\!"

The huge sword lolita held the sword on her shoulder and was very unwilling to accept this.

Chu Xiaoye sighed and ignored her.

Lanisi explained in a low voice, "Vilis, what you mean is that we have to wait for the orcs to cross the bridge before we swing the sword in our hands and rush up to fight. However, what Night means is that when they cross the bridge, we will start to shoot with arrows. This way, before the other party can approach us, they will suffer heavy casualties. When the timid get scared, it will even cause trampling and killing each other."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but sigh. A queen was a queen. She was not a bimbo and understood immediately.

As for this huge sword loli, heh, she was a classic example of having big breasts and no brains.

Vilis stopped talking.

As a warrior, she had always believed and followed the spirit of chivalry. As long as it was about fighting, she would be open and honest. She had never thought of playing tricks and scheming against the other party, but it was different now.

This was a war regarding the survival of the entire elven race, not a battle between two people.

Therefore, she agreed with Chu Xiaoye's method.

However, even though she agreed, deep in her heart, she still treated this bald lion as a despicable fellow who liked to play tricks. Especially that big smelly fart from before, it almost made her doubt life.

As for letting the other party be her mount, she did not dare to do so now.

Who knew how much smelly fart this fellow had. If he let it out every day, she would probably even have the intention to die.
