Chapter 227: Son-in-Law

The day here was longer.

However, there were also nights.

After the sky turned dark, the female tiger, Dora, prepared to go out to hunt.

When hunting, she naturally had to bring her daughter and her son-in-law.

The two little fellows seemed to be getting along very well.

As for the golden-haired little lion king, it seemed to be very patient and gentle with her daughter. It was like a meticulous sidekick that always licked and tidied the fur on her daughter.

This made her very happy.

However, every time she turned around and continued walking, her precious daughter would tremble all over and lick the golden-haired little lion king's fur pitifully.

Their territory was very big.

The entire forest here was almost their territory.

Due to her daughter, Dora did not live with the members of her tribe.

Not only were there white tigers in her tribe, there were also colorful tigers. Their relationship was complicated and it was not suitable for her daughter to grow up there.

The colorful tiger from before was originally in her tribe, but it sneaked into her territory. Clearly, it had ill intentions and wanted to kill her daughter to make her go into heat again.

However, that lowly fellow did not know that even if she really went into heat, she would not mate with any species other than the white tiger.

She felt disgusted at those dirty fellows.

In her opinion, only snow-white and pure fur was clean and noble.

Of course, the golden-haired little lion behind her was an exception.

She believed in her judgment and wisdom.

This little lion's golden claws and the golden fur on its neck already revealed how extraordinary and outstanding he was.

She believed that when this little lion reached adulthood, it would definitely become a super lion king that the white lion would be afraid of\!

Therefore, she had to invest in advance.

Although lions and tigers were not of the same species, there was not much difference.

Furthermore, the upper echelons of the snow mountain had long established a precedent. The descendants they produced had already become overlords of a region. They were so strong that even the lord of the snow mountain feared them.

She believed that with her daughter's noble genes and the powerful genes of this little lion, she could definitely create a species that would shock all lions and tigers\!

Dora thought of something exciting and could not help but look back at the little lion. She realized that her daughter was licking the fur of the little lion and was stunned.

However, the little lion then helped her daughter lick her fur.

They looked loving and harmonious.

Dora looked at her beloved son-in-law and liked him more and more. She could not help but stop in her tracks and turn around to walk over. She also stuck out her tongue to lick him a few times.

This terrified Chu Xiaoye.

He thought that his abuse and threats to her daughter had been discovered.

Fortunately, the other party only licked him a few times and did not bite his neck off.

After Dora licked him, she walked in front happily.

Chu Xiaoye felt insulted and slapped the little white tiger's head beside him. When the female tiger heard the noise and turned around, he raised his claws and rubbed his head.

Luo Mei lowered her head. Her eyes were watery from being bullied by him, but she did not dare to say anything.

When the female tiger continued to look ahead and walk, Chu Xiaoye stuck his head in front of the little white tiger's mouth and ordered her to continue licking.

If the tigress bullied him, he would bully her daughter. Let's see who is more vicious\!

A group of snow deer suddenly appeared in the forest in front of him.

These snow deer were also much larger than the snow deer Chu Xiaoye had seen previously. They were clearly unique species here.

Dora turned around and gestured for them to wait here. She also gestured for her daughter to watch how to hunt.

Luo Mei immediately raised her head and studied it seriously.

Dora's feet were silent. She lowered her body and quietly approached from the side of the snow deer.

Her snow-white fur seemed to be a natural disguise in the snow-covered forest, making it difficult for the snow deer to discover her.

Once a snow deer looked up, she stopped and crawled on the ground like a pile of snow.

Soon, she hid twenty meters away.

In the snow, there were still some plants with extremely tenacious life force and some green bushes growing.

Those snow deer were eating happily and did not know that the danger was approaching.

Actually, with the speed and strength of Dora, it could catch these prey even if they ran 100 meters away.

She was naturally teaching her daughter by hunting like this.

Luo Mei stood in place and did not move. Her round eyes were wide open as she looked at her mother exceptionally seriously.

Chu Xiaoye took the opportunity to ride on her back, pressed his two claws on her head, and raised his head to watch her mother hunt with her.

Luo Mei grinned. She wanted to roar, but she was afraid of disturbing her mother's hunt. She was also afraid that this fellow would use his claws to disfigure her. She could only tolerate and let her bully her.

"Whoosh—"

Dora moved\!

She suddenly jumped out from behind the tree and pounced at a snow deer that was lowering its head to eat grass\!

Before the snow deer could react, she pushed it to the ground. Just as it was about to resist, she slapped its head with a bang, causing its brain to explode and it died\!

At this moment, Dora suddenly remembered that she was teaching her daughter how to hunt. She hurriedly lowered her head and bit the snow deer's neck.

The other snow deer immediately fled in fear.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped the little white tiger's butt and told her to go over quickly. They were going to eat.

Luo Mei felt extremely wronged, but she did not dare to disobey. She could only carry him and walk over shakily, almost falling.

Chu Xiaoye did not care about the fairer sex and continued to slap her butt. When the female tiger stood up, he quickly jumped down from the little white tiger's back and stuck out his tongue. As he walked, he licked her ear.

He wanted to make this little white tiger afraid of him.

This way, he could find a chance to leave.

Dora used her claws to tear open the deer's abdomen and let her daughter eat it.

When Chu Xiaoye and the little white tiger walked over and were about to eat, a roar suddenly came from the forest beside them\!

Then, a huge white male tiger strode out.

This white male tiger was even larger than Dora. Cold killing intent appeared in its eyes. Clearly, it was not a member of their tribe.

"Roar —"

Dora immediately bared her fangs and roared angrily, protecting her daughter and Chu Xiaoye behind her.

This male tiger had trespassed their territory and clearly had ill intentions. It was definitely not here just for this prey.

Dora immediately turned around, her eyes filled with anxiety. She gestured for Chu Xiaoye to quickly leave with her daughter.

Right at this moment, another low growl came from the forest behind them.

Then, another huge white male tiger walked out of the forest with a murderous aura.

It turned out that these two male tigers had already set up an ambush here. They were waiting for Dora to bring her daughter out to hunt.

At this moment, there were tigers in front and behind. Luo Mei's speed could not compare to these two strong male tigers.

When Dora saw this scene, her body trembled and she let out an angry roar, hoping to attract her companions.

However, she also knew that their territory was very big. Those companions each had their own territory and would not easily step into each other's territory. They were too far away to hear.

Even if they could hear her, they would not be able to save her in time.

She knew that her daughter was in the most dangerous situation.

These two male tigers had clearly come prepared.

She bared her fangs and protected her daughter behind her. She decided to protect her daughter no matter what.

"Whoosh\!"

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly climbed up a big tree at the side.

When Luo Mei saw this, she immediately climbed up.

Dora knew that this was not safe.

Although these two male tigers were huge, climbing trees was easy for them.

Furthermore, with their strength, it would be even more dangerous if they hid on the tree.

The other party only needed to break the trees from the roots and her daughter would fall to her death.

However, there was no other way. She could only face the enemy like this.

She retreated under the tree and decided to guard this place to the death, waiting for her companions in the tribe to save her.

If her companions could not arrive in time, she could only rely on herself.

"Roar —"

She roared again, her voice shaking the forest. With a whoosh, her two feet reached out with a pair of sharp claws\!

The two tall and sturdy white male tigers were not frightened by her fierce appearance and walked over calmly.

On the tree, Luo Mei shivered and whimpered.

Chu Xiaoye reached out with his claws and rubbed her head, telling her to stop being noisy and stay quiet.

For some reason, seeing his calm appearance, the fear in Luo Mei's heart gradually subsided.

The two male tigers gathered and walked in front of Dora.

Dora bared her fangs and leaned against the tree, roaring terrifyingly.

Just as the two male tigers were about to pounce on it and bite it, a figure suddenly flew out of the tree with a whoosh and landed on another big tree not far away.

The two male tigers raised their heads and looked at the tree.

Dora was shocked. She thought that the little lion had abandoned her daughter and fled alone.

When she raised her head and looked at the tree, she realized that the tree was already empty and there was no sign of her daughter.

She immediately turned around and looked at the big tree not far away.

At this moment, the little golden-haired lion was carrying her daughter and hanging on a branch. After shaking it a few times, it jumped onto a branch and stood there steadily.

As for her daughter, she was still lying tightly on the other party's back, her four legs clamped tightly around the golden-haired little lion's body. Her two claws in front of her almost pierced into the other party's neck.

"Bang\!"

The little lion immediately raised its claws and slapped her daughter's head rudely.

At this moment, her daughter let go slightly.

Dora was stunned and overjoyed. Her daughter had not been riding horses in the cave to play, but to practice her escaping skills\!

This way, the two male tigers could not hurt them easily\!

When the two male tigers saw this scene, they immediately ran towards the big tree.

Their goal was not to kill this female tiger, but to kill the young female tiger and force her to go into heat.

Dora roared angrily and pounced at one of the male tigers.

Although the other party was larger and stronger, her claws were not to be trifled with\!

The male tiger was clearly also a little afraid of her claws. It immediately stopped running and carefully welcomed her battle.

The other male tiger did not stop. Instead, it quickly ran under the tree and jumped onto it.

However, just as he jumped up, Chu Xiaoye had already jumped up again with the little white tiger on his back and landed on another big tree.

The male tiger immediately jumped down from the tree and ran over.

Chu Xiaoye carried the little white tiger and stood on the tree, looking at him coldly. His body was bleeding from the little white tiger's sharp claws, and he did not seem to notice.

The male tiger jumped onto the tree again.

Chu Xiaoye immediately carried the little white tiger and jumped out again, landing on a big tree further away.

Due to its fear, the little white tiger's four claws almost pierced into his skin. If not for that, it could not catch him at all when he jumped.

Looking at the blood flowing out of his body, the little white tiger's eyes were filled with tears. The hatred it had for him disappeared at this moment.

The male tiger did not stop and chased over again. It suddenly jumped up the tree.

He was very calm and did not flare up.

Because he knew that it was very exhausting for this little lion to carry the little white tiger and jump. It definitely could not last for long and would fall into his mouth sooner or later\!

When he climbed up the tree, Chu Xiaoye continued to jump with the little white tiger on his back and jumped back to the big tree from before.

The male tiger narrowed its eyes and immediately chased over.

This repeated jump and chase lasted for more than twenty minutes. Furthermore, they moved on these two identical trees and did not jump towards other trees.

The male tiger was played around with and finally could not help but roar angrily. It stopped climbing the tree and started to use its huge palm to destroy the tree.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree with the little white tiger on his back and looked at him coldly.

This way, he was not the only one who exhausted his energy faster.

Furthermore, the heat in his body was continuously replenishing his energy.

He could still jump back and forth dozens of times.

However, the little white tiger on his back had too sharp claws. His neck and abdomen were already dripping with blood.

The little white tiger's head was buried tightly in his neck and in his golden fur. No one knew if it was because of guilt or fear, but it never raised its head.

The battle between the female tiger and the male tiger was still intense. Both were injured.

The female tiger used her claws and agility to tightly entangle the male tiger, preventing it from leaving.

As for the male tiger under the tree, it could only fight alone.

"Bang\!"

He suddenly slapped the empty tree trunk.

The entire tree fell with a crack.

However, before this, Chu Xiaoye had already jumped onto another tree with the little white tiger on his back.

The male tiger was furious. It immediately ran under the tree and used its sharp claws to dig the tree trunk again.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and watched as he expended his energy in exasperation. He was still calm and was not in a hurry to fight.

He wanted to anger the other party and make him exhausted before giving him a fatal blow\!

Of course, before that, he hoped that the female tiger could calm down and hang in there, not falling prematurely.

As long as she could hold on and hold on to the male tiger, preventing it from coming over to help, victory would belong to them\!

Luo Mei lay quietly on his back, her face buried in the golden fur. She looked through the fur and stared blankly at his still calm and composed profile.

Wasn't he in pain and afraid?
