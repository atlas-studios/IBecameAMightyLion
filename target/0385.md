Chapter 385: Untitled

Of course it was good to be alive.

The unfamiliar pride that had been tempted by the dense smell of blood did not rashly approach. They only paced around the grassland not far away.

Before dawn, they had already retreated.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, the Jerry brothers, these few tall and strong figures could always make the enemy retreat before a battle happened.

Only with self-awareness could he live longer.

After dawn.

Under the reprimand and urging of the sisters, the Chino brothers arrived at the border of the territory and started to leave the pungent male scent on the grass again to warn the competitors.

In order to not let the viruses continue to spread, Chu Xiaoye ordered Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others to guard and patrol the grass that covered the water buffaloes and hyenas day and night, deterring the thieves.

For three consecutive days, carnivores would wander around the vicinity every night and wait, but there was no chance.

Five days later, the surroundings of the grass finally returned to calm.

However, to hungry wild beasts, even rotten flesh was very tempting.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye did not lower his guard. He would let Little Curly Tail and the others patrol the area every night.

Ten days later.

Everything was calm.

However, during this period of time, Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized something terrifying.

The herbivores that had once covered the grassland suddenly became much fewer.

The numbers of many animals started to decrease.

The zebras that had once formed groups, gazelles, gnus, water buffaloes, and other animal groups became fewer and fewer. In four to five days, there was sometimes only one tribe. Furthermore, there were only ten-over members.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and circled every grassland in the territory. He did not discover the lively scene that had once been bustling with activity.

The grass on the grassland was still lush and growing.

The climate was suitable and there was plenty of water.

This was not the dry season.

However, where was the once-mighty army of carnivores? Where did they go?

Half a month later.

The entire pride finally felt that the situation was a little serious.

They had not eaten for three days. It was not that they could not catch prey, but they did not find a single prey in the entire territory\!

The few herbivores also disappeared.

The members of the pride of the cold father had once experienced such difficult times every year on the grassland on the other side of the mountain. They seemed to be used to it.

They were not unfamiliar with the lack of food.

However, in this situation, everyone knew that it was not just a lack of food.

There was not even a single prey in the entire territory. It was even more serious than the dry season over there\!

Chu Xiaoye did not wait for death.

On the third night, he brought Little Curly Tail and the others out of his territory and invaded his neighbor's territory rudely.

He was not fighting or snatching territory. He was only looking for prey.

However, the neighboring pride seemed to have long left.

There was no sign of the pride in the territory. Even the scent of the pride had long disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others and wandered around this empty territory. They still did not see any prey.

They walked for an entire night and searched for an entire night, but they did not see anything.

At dawn, Chu Xiaoye brought the team and stepped into the third territory.

This time, they finally saw the owner of this territory—a group of dispirited lions who had empty stomachs and messy fur.

Two old lions and seven female lions dragging their children.

The other young lions seemed to have long fled this land.

When this group of lions saw the invaders, they no longer had the strength to be angry and fight. They were still lying in the grass, motionless, looking at them blankly.

He did not even have the strength to roar.

Obviously, they had been hungry for a longer time and were already at the critical moment of not being able to stand up.

In this lush territory, there was not even a prey. They could not even fill their stomachs. What was there to protect and miss?

Whoever wanted it could occupy it.

When Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others in front of the lions, they only bared their fangs and made a fierce appearance that warned them to stop approaching. However, they did not even have the intention to struggle up to express their aura.

On the grass at the side, the two young lions were already on the verge of death from hunger.

The two old lions drooped their eyelids and were sleepy, as if they had already ignored life and death and treated the invader in front of them as air.

From their size and the scars on their faces, they had once been two strong and majestic lions that had been through hundreds of battles. Now, they were already old and could not even eat.

Chu Xiaoye did not stay any longer or disturb their last moments. He continued forward with the team.

A red sun stood proudly on the horizon. A few clouds blushed.

The morning wind brought with it the salty moisture of the sea and coldness. At the same time, it also brought with it a rotten smell.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and walked towards the sea.

Soon, he saw a few corpses in another pride's territory.

The corpses of the lion and lionesses had already rotted beyond recognition, but no animals came to enjoy them nearby. The figure of vultures was also lost in the sky.

In just a few days, this once lively grassland actually turned silent.

Suddenly, in the grass in front of him, a green snake about three meters long crawled out with a whoosh and quickly swam towards the sea.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before he immediately chased after her with the team.

He only followed behind and did not go up to catch it.

The green snake swam very quickly and did not know fatigue. It kept running forward and looked a little anxious, as if it did not discover the stalker behind it.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and followed behind unhurriedly, wanting to see where it was going.

Perhaps, following it, he could find the disappeared animals.

Along the way, the grass swayed and there was nothing.

In the evening, the green snake finally slowed down.

It seemed to be tired, but it did not stop walking and was still crawling forward.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw the sea in front of him.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, the green snake suddenly accelerated and rushed forward.

Chu Xiaoye immediately increased his speed and followed. He saw a cliff in front of him. The green snake jumped down without hesitation and fell onto the reef below, but it did not die. It twisted a few times and fell into the water, immediately swimming towards the sea.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the edge of the cliff and looked down. The waves slapped the shore and splashed. Other than the green snake, there were no other creatures in the sea. There was not even a sea bird.

The distant sky suddenly blocked the light and turned dark.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. The sea was deep blue and rose and fell. It was endless, like another mysterious world.

The sky soon turned dark. The already dark sea became even deeper and terrifying, like a huge ancient ferocious beast crawling there.

The waves were its fur, swaying in the wind. As for its huge mouth that could devour the world, it was unknown where it was hiding, but it seemed to be everywhere.

Chu Xiaoye was afraid of the sea.

Be it when he was a human or when he was a lion now, he was afraid.

"Whoosh\!"

Under his feet, the waves slapped the reef and splashed.

Chu Xiaoye looked down and his pupils suddenly constricted. The sea seemed to be retreating quickly\!

The sea near the shore had always been wandering in and out of progress, advancing and retreating, tirelessly repeating its life.

But now, Chu Xiaoye could clearly see that the sea near the shore was only retreating and not advancing.

The entire coastline's water was quickly retreating and surging into the distance, revealing many black reefs and sand, as well as the corpses of shellfish.

The entire sea seemed to be drying up quickly\!

The sky was even darker and black clouds rolled over\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and immediately jumped onto the backs of the Jerry brothers. His eyes flickered with a golden light as he looked into the distance of the sea. He was shocked to discover that the sea at the distant horizon was getting higher and higher, as if an ancient beast had opened its bloody mouth and was devouring the sky\!

"Tsunami\!"

At this moment, these two words suddenly popped up in Chu Xiaoye's mind.

The disappearance of the animals, the departure of the sea bird, and the green snake jumping into the sea in a panic and swimming into the distance. At this moment, there seemed to be an explanation.

Those herbivores and sea birds had long sensed something and were the first to escape. As for the green snake, it did not stay far from the sea and jumped into the sea anxiously. It was afraid that it could not escape from the shore, so it took a risk and prepared to break through the waves and escape behind the huge wave before the tsunami could show its greatest strength.

The might of a tsunami on the sea might not be too great, and the height of the waves would not even exceed a meter. However, once they went ashore and were blocked and collided by the shore, they would form terrifying giant water walls. Wherever they went, they would destroy the world and devour everything\!

Any life and building could not withstand a single blow in front of it\!

Therefore, when Chu Xiaoye looked at the strange scene in front of him and thought of this terrifying possibility, he no longer hesitated. He immediately roared anxiously and jumped down from the Jerry brothers' backs, turned around, and ran.

Although the members of the pride looked at each other and did not know what was happening, they did not hesitate and hurriedly followed behind, turning around to escape.

In the depths of the ground, a slight tremble suddenly came.

Perhaps there had been an earthquake in the depths of the sea long ago, and only now did they feel it.

Towards this vibration, the elephants on the grassland were definitely worthy of being detectors. Their strong bones and thick elephant legs could receive very slight sounds from the ground and from afar.

The early departure of the herbivores on the grassland might be their tip-off.

As for birds, they had always been the species best at sensing the dangers of nature. Although they flew in the sky, the terrifying waves and the storms they brought would also pose a fatal threat to them.

At that time, everything here would be destroyed. They would not even have a place to stop and hunt. If they did not leave, they could only wait for death.

The grassland at night was once very lively. Hungry and strong predators liked to come out at night to join in the fun.

But now, the grassland was empty and silent.

The departure of the herbivores starved some carnivores and also made more carnivores leave.

The pride seemed to be used to living comfortably on this fertile grassland and was a little slow to react.

Chu Xiaoye was the first to run back to the territory at his fastest speed. He let out an anxious roar and called out the members of the pride, the leopard family, Little Mi, Pit, and so on.

"Roarâ€”"

This high and long roar was actually just one word. "Run\!"

Everyone was puzzled. They looked at each other and did not know what this "run" meant. Should they run at night, run to patrol, or run to hunt?

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and rushed into the bushes with a whoosh. He crawled into the bushes and slapped the little girl, who was still sleeping inside, awake.

"Come on\!"

He was panting as he lay in front of the little girl. His face was distorted and he widened his eyes, looking anxious and fierce. "Hurry\! Don't dawdle\!"

The little girl was sleepy and her exquisite face was filled with confusion. Although she did not know what was happening, she immediately climbed onto his back and hugged his neck tightly.

Chu Xiaoye rushed out of the bushes. Just as he was about to rush out of the bushes, he suddenly saw a snow-white shirt, skirt, socks, and white leather shoes hanging on the low bushes at the side.

He paused for a moment and immediately tilted his body, lifting the little girl off his back. He fiddled with the things and pointed at the white leather shoes.

Shoes were very important to humans, especially when escaping.

Perhaps at some point in time, this little girl would have to rely on her speed to escape. He could not care about her in a life and death situation.

If he could run faster and survive by leaving her behind, he would not hesitate.

He was a lion and the king of this pride. He had the responsibility to lead them and continue to live, not to live for his previous life.

The little girl immediately understood what he meant and quickly wore the pair of small leather shoes.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail, Blue Eyes, and the others had already run back.

Chu Xiaoye immediately lay on the ground and urged the little girl to come up.

As the little girl climbed onto his back, she grabbed her skirt and long socks. Then, she raised her head and looked reluctantly at the hut on the tree and the beef jerky on it.

She knew that those things might never belong to her again.

However, she would not feel regret.

Although she also needed them, what she needed the most was the beautiful lion king with a golden mane under her.

As long as he was here, she would never leave him no matter what.

No matter how warm the hut was or how fragrant the beef jerky was, it was not as important as her king.

The little girl lay on his back, her arms wrapped tightly around his neck, and her face was buried in the lush golden mane. Although she sensed his uneasiness, she was very at ease.

She believed that with him around, all problems could be resolved.

Chu Xiaoye roared again and ran towards the distant mountain range with the pride.

Although the pride was puzzled and confused, they did not hesitate and immediately followed behind him, running at their fastest speed.

The seed of trust had long been planted and germinated at this moment.

Chu Xiaoye wanted to kill the brat on his back\!

The two snow-white long socks were tied to his neck and strangled his majestic mane. They replaced the mane and fluttered with the wind.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and wanted to look at the distant tsunami, but he only saw a pink face with golden hair flying as she bit her lips and held in her laughter.
