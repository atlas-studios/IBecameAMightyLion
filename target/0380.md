tripwiretripwireChapter 380: Untitled

 

The pain was heart-wrenching and bone-chilling\!

Chu Xiaoye lay on the grass, clamped his hind legs, opened his mouth, and widened his eyes. His face was distorted and his entire body trembled in pain. He almost fainted.

The female lion steadily landed on the back of a water buffalo not far away, her back dripping with blood.

She turned around with a cold gaze. Just as she was about to take the opportunity to jump over and deal a fatal blow, a figure suddenly rushed up from the grass beside her and pounced on her\!

The female lion was caught off guard and was actually pushed down from the cow's back by the figure, landing miserably in the grass.

Before she could jump up, a sharp silver claw pierced into her abdomen with a whoosh\!

The female lion was shocked. She suddenly kicked the ground with her limbs and her entire body actually flew back with a whoosh. She immediately broke free from the silver claw and avoided the tragedy of her stomach being cut open\!

The water buffaloes mooed and flew with their iron hooves, charging over with a murderous aura.

The female lion was terrified by the figure that suddenly appeared. She looked up and saw that the figure suddenly disappeared.

Seeing that the water buffaloes had rushed away ferociously, the female lion suddenly jumped up and landed on the back of a huge water buffalo again. She raised her eyes to search, but still did not find the ghost-like killer.

Tonight, she felt fear for the first time.

When she turned around and looked at the young lion king, she originally thought that the other party was still lying on the ground unable to move, or that he had already fainted from the pain, or that he had been trampled into meat paste by the water buffalo. Then, she suddenly realized that at some point in time, the other party was actually lying on the back of a water buffalo and continuing to open his mouth, his face distorted as he cried out silently.

It hurt\! It really hurt\!

Chu Xiaoye's distorted face and eyes that were filled with tears clearly expressed his pain.

The muscles at the corner of the female lion's eyes twitched and the tail behind her swayed slightly, feeling a little unbelievable.

How did he go up?

With her strength just now and her experience in fighting enemies in the past, this young lion should have already exploded from her slap. Why did he only feel pain?

Although the female lions were puzzled, they did not have the time to think.

She had to kill this young lion king and take control of this pride.

The powerful killer just now made her even more curious and covetous of this powerful and mysterious pride.

"Chi\!"

Her sharp claws pierced deeply into the water buffalo's back.

The water buffalo was in pain and furious. It ran around crazily to resist, scaring the surrounding water buffaloes into running around.

The female lion's gaze was burning. She still did not discover any trace of the killer. She no longer hesitated and jumped up with a whoosh, pouncing on the young lion king.

Right at this moment, the grass on the ground suddenly swayed and the figure appeared again. It jumped up straight and rushed into the sky. With a whoosh, it grabbed at her abdomen\!

The female lion was furious. She suddenly swung her tail and suddenly twisted her body in midair, changing directions. She lowered her head and fell down, raising her claws to swing it\!

Two figures, one up and one down, one big and one small, swung their claws and instantly passed each other.

"Bam\!"

The female lion landed on the ground and jumped forward a few times before standing steadily.

After the figure jumped into the air, it did not land. Instead, it landed on the back of a water buffalo and turned around, looking at her coldly with its dark eyes.

This time, the female lion finally saw the killer's face clearly. It was an extremely young female cub\!

"Boom\!"

The water buffaloes rushed over ferociously with a murderous aura\!

The female lion ignored them and did not show any fear or panic. She stared at Catherine with a burning gaze. When the water buffaloes rushed close, she jumped lightly and stood on the back of another water buffalo.

"Whoosh\!"

The two female lions actually jumped up at the same time and pounced at each other. They were as fast as lightning and instantly passed each other, landing on the water buffalo that the other party had just stood on.

A few bloody wounds appeared on Catherine's head and dyed her fur red.

There were also a few bloody scratches on the right abdomen of the female lion. Blood was flowing out and her entire abdomen was almost broken from the side\!

The female lion's eyes were grave and furious. Every time this little thing attacked, it would point at her abdomen, looking like it wanted to open her stomach. Damn it\!

What has it got to do with you that I challenged the lion king?

Why did he have to be a busybody and eat more farts?

Ever since the two rains of blood, her intelligence and skills had become higher and higher. Ever since she was bitten by a red-eyed hyena, she became stronger and stronger. At the same time, her desire grew larger and she became more and more bloodthirsty and cruel.

After she killed the lion king and the other lions in her tribe, she became the new leader of the pride. However, she was not satisfied and still wanted to occupy more prides and defeat stronger lion kings.

Therefore, she came here.

However, she never would have thought that she would encounter this lioness whose strength was not inferior to hers at all tonight. Furthermore, she was even younger than her.

Jealousy distorted her face and made her look completely different\!

"Roarâ€”"

The female lion roared angrily and pounced at Catherine again, as if she had forgotten about the young lion king.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was lying miserably on the cow's back, not moving.

After jumping for a while, the water buffalo saw that it could not shake him off. In its panic, it ran around and actually rushed towards the water buffaloes guarding outside the bushes.

Seeing that its eyes were red and that it was charging over angrily, the water buffaloes immediately dodged and made way for him.

"Mooâ€”"

The water buffalo leader immediately ordered him to stop this stupid action.

However, the water buffalo was already terrified and had lost its mind. As if it could not hear its orders, it carried Chu Xiaoye and ran crazily in the herd.

The neat water buffaloes immediately fell into chaos.

The water buffalo leader was furious. He immediately ordered the other water buffaloes to attack this water buffalo and swore to chase this herd away\!

The surrounding water buffaloes immediately lowered their heads and started to argue angrily.

This water buffalo staggered from its companions and became even more terrified and helpless. Its mind was in chaos. It suddenly raised its hooves and ran crazily, charging straight towards the bushes.

The water buffaloes chased for a distance before stopping and not daring to go forward.

In the bushes, the members of the pride of the cold father were tense when they heard the commotion outside and were waiting solemnly. They were shocked to see a water buffalo swing its tail and charge over without care.

Now, only the cold father, the female lions, the Chino brothers, the Jiela sisters, and the others were left in the pride's camp. If the water buffaloes rushed in at this moment, they would have no strength to retaliate\!

Just as everyone was feeling terrified and uneasy, the Jiela sisters suddenly jumped out and guarded the outermost area. They bared their fangs and roared at the huge water buffalo that was charging ferociously.

Her six sisters immediately rushed out and stood with them.

At this moment, everyone realized that there was only a water buffalo charging towards the bushes.

Hence, the cold father immediately roared angrily and rushed out with the female lions, standing with them.

The Chino brothers also let out a loud roar and tried to threaten the water buffalo that was alone\!

Because the water buffalo was too tall and Chu Xiaoye was lying motionless on it, the pride did not discover him for a moment.

Only the little girl sitting on the tree suddenly saw him and hurriedly stood up. Her excited little face was red as she shouted excitedly, "It's the king\! It's the king\! The king returned riding the big cow\!"

Unfortunately, the members of the pride did not know what she was shouting.

The water buffalo seemed to have gone crazy. It did not care how many lions were blocking in front of it, nor did it care if it was a lone cow. It swung its tail and charged crazily.

Seeing that this giant water buffalo was fearless and had rushed in front of them like a crazy elephant, even the bravest Jiela sisters had no choice but to quickly dodge.

The pride hurriedly made way.

The water buffalo rushed past them with a whoosh. Just as it was about to continue running into the bushes, it suddenly tripped on the vines that were raised horizontally on the ground.

This was the trip wire Chu Xiaoye left behind before he left. It was the same as the one he made when hunting giraffes back then. It was to prevent any accidents from happening after they left.

Now, it seemed to have come in handy.

"Bang\!"

The huge water buffalo suddenly fell forward and fell to the ground. Its head hit the ground heavily and its neck broke with a crack. Its bones broke and his body folded. It was on the verge of death\!

The cold father immediately ran over with the pride.

However, when they ran close, everyone was dumbfounded to see an extremely familiar figure lying on the back of this huge water buffalo\!

His golden mane was still majestic and exceptionally striking in the dark night\!

However, the figure lay there with its hind legs wide open and did not move.

The cold father widened his eyes in shock. When he came close to take a look, he immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Aisha hurriedly ran over and licked the golden mane on Chu Xiaoye's head and neck lovingly.

"Roarâ€¦"

Chu Xiaoye called out weakly and got up shakily, but his legs were limp and he could not stand. He could only climb under the tree and lie there, letting out a groan of pain.

Damn it, he wanted to tear that lioness into pieces\!

The Chino brothers, the Jiela sisters, and the other lionesses surrounded him and looked at him with concern, wanting to ask him what happened. It seemed that there were no obvious wounds on his body.

Chu Xiaoye silently clamped his legs and used his tail to cover them. He waved his claws to show that he was fine and told them to take the time to eat.

The water buffalo that had carried him home had already completely stopped breathing. The two cows' eyes were wide open, and they clearly died with grievance.

The cold father looked at him strangely and was the first to walk in front of the water buffalo, preparing to eat.

The other members immediately surrounded him.

Everyone had not eaten for a few days and were already hungry. Since this young king had given the order, they would follow it respectfully and not wait for the other members to return.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked out of the bushes. He suddenly let out a long roar and called for Catherine to return. At the same time, he called for Little Curly Tail and the others to immediately return with their prey.

The female lion was too strange and was extremely strong. He was worried that Catherine was not her match.

It was never too late to take revenge\!

When he recuperated for the night, he had to personally take revenge\!

A dignified lion king was actually humiliated by a lioness\! He could not tolerate it\!

"Bad king, what's wrong?"

At this moment, the little girl's concerned voice suddenly came from the tree.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and his face was distorted. He wanted to beg, "Please don't call me the bad king again. Can we not mention eggs please?"

The little girl was stunned for a moment when she saw him like this. She suddenly opened her palm and said with a grin, "Look, what's this? I just discovered it in the big bird's nest above me. It's very nutritious. Can I give it to you to eat?"

"..."

Chu Xiaoye seemed to have heard and seen the scene of Belita eating her mouth full of egg juice. He immediately felt a chill run down his spine.

Right at this moment, the water buffaloes guarding outside suddenly became chaotic.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly appeared on the back of a water buffalo. Then, with a jump, it jumped onto the back of another water buffalo. With a few more leaps, it came close to the bushes. Then, it jumped into the bushes.

The members of the pride who were eating were shocked. Just as they were about to get up and attack, they realized that this swift, peerlessly brave and fierce figure was actually Catherine.

The roar from the cold father's mouth stopped abruptly and his stomach trembled.

Catherine's forehead, back, and thigh were covered in deep scars. After landing on the ground, she quietly walked to Chu Xiaoye's side. Her eyes trembled as she looked at him guiltily. She ignored the other members and the bloody water buffalo as if they were air.

"She ran away."

Chu Xiaoye knew what she meant and knew how guilty she was, but his heart was very warm.

The corner of his mouth split into a smile, indicating that it was okay.

"Good job. Let her run. I'll take revenge myself."

Catherine turned her head and looked at him.

Chu Xiaoye clamped his legs tightly again uncomfortably and lowered his tail, looking embarrassed.

When the little girl on the tree saw him like this, she immediately said in surprise, "Bad king, you're shy\!" Then, she spread her palm and repeated, "Do you want to eat eggs or not?"

"Eggs your ass\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly looked up and glared\!

This stupid girl\!
