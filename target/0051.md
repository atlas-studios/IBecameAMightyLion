Chapter 51: I'll Endorse Myself

He could not wait anymore\!

When Samantha, the hyena queen, raised her head and drooled, preparing to walk under the little leopard, a figure on the tree beside her suddenly jumped down with a whoosh\!

"Whoosh\!"

The leaves swayed and a strong wind suddenly appeared\!

A killing intent instantly arrived\!

Before Samantha and the other hyenas could react, Chu Xiaoye had already pounced on her and bit her neck\!

"Oh —"

The hyena queen's cry was terrified and anxious\!

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate at all. He picked her up with his mouth, turned around, and returned to the tree. He quickly jumped up\!

Only then did the other hyenas react\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The twenty-over hyenas immediately retreated from under the big tree where the little leopard was lying and surrounded him. They raised their heads and roared angrily.

They never would have thought that there was actually a lion cub hiding on another tree and ambushing their queen\!

How bold\!

They ran in panic while shouting hoarsely, surrounding the big tree and looking flustered.

Chu Xiaoye was not as timid as the little leopard.

He bit the hyena queen's neck and stood on the lowest branch with his head lowered, looking disdainfully at the hyena army below. He was calm and composed.

From the day he became a lion, he had been thinking of ways to guard against these cruel enemies.

Climbing trees was the best way.

To the ferocious hyenas, the tree was a place they could never touch.

Of course.

Now, the hyena queen had finally achieved her dream and come onto the tree before she died.

At this moment, this Queen was glaring with her eyes and mouth open, struggling helplessly.

However, he could not make a sound.

She probably never would have thought that her life as a queen who had been through hundreds of battles and fought against every pride for years would end tonight.

Furthermore, it was ended by an underage cub. 

Her ruling career, like the lion that she had just eaten, finally came to an end tonight.

She was unwilling to accept this.

However, this was her end.

Just like the dead lion, perhaps she was doomed a long time ago. 

"Crack\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly used strength again with his two rows of sharp fangs and bit her neck off.

He did not want to waste his precious saliva on the female hyena's neck forever.

The hyenas under the tree were still barking angrily.

He let go of his mouth and returned the Queen's corpse to them.

"Bam\!"

The hyena queen fell to the ground with her mouth open in death.

The hyenas around her were stunned for a moment. Then, they rushed forward and started biting her corpse excitedly without hesitation\!

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch and watched this scene silently. He was not happy at all after taking revenge for Gigi.

Soon.

The hyena queen's corpse was eaten clean by her clansmen.

The two female hyenas that had previously licked her fur and protected her and looked after her cubs ate especially excitedly.

The Queen was dead.

Then, starting tonight, they would be candidates for the new queen\!

He was only a step away from becoming a king\!

Tonight, the hyenas would welcome a new queen in battle\!

The hyenas finally left.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the little leopard on another tree and had the urge to fart at her again.

This timid little female leopard had almost ruined his plans\!

"Roar\!"

The little female leopard bared her sharp fangs at him, as if she was threatening him to not go over\!

Climbing trees was a leopard's natural skill.

It was because they knew how to climb trees that they could survive until now.

Now, this cub had actually learned to climb trees\!

Furthermore, his climbing skills were not inferior to hers at all. He had even attacked the hyenas from the tree just now. He was stealing their jobs\! He was threatening their survival\!

Lions were stronger than leopards to begin with, and they lived in groups.

If lions could climb trees in the future, wouldn't all leopard cubs starve to death and be bitten to death?

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"Damn it\! Damn it\!"

Belita's cries were filled with indignation and anger.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked around for a while. Seeing that the big female leopard did not seem to be at the scene, he immediately climbed down the tree.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"Little thief\! Don't run\! Explain to me why you know how to climb trees?"

Seeing that he was about to escape, Belita immediately became bolder and continued to roar at him arrogantly.

Chu Xiaoye had already walked past her big tree and was not going to mind her.

However, since this little female leopard was so impudent and chattered on, perhaps he should teach her a lesson and let her know that a lion was not to be trifled with\!

Especially a handsome and cool male cub like him\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and turned around. He jumped up the tree with a whoosh and quickly crawled in front of her. He bared his fangs and had a fierce expression\!

"Wu…"

The little leopard that was still roaring just a second ago started to tremble and her aggressive roar turned into a whimper.

She peed her pants.

This fellow was so terrifying\!

He even dared to kill the hyena queen and her mother was afraid of him. Why should she provoke him?

"Wuwu…"

"Spare me… I was wrong…"

She shivered and put away her fangs, looking pitiful as she admitted defeat.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her mockingly and turned around, seemingly preparing to go down.

Belita immediately relaxed.

However.

The next second, her expression changed drastically\!

The ferocious cub suddenly curled its tail and aimed its butt at her face. With a bang, it suddenly sprayed out a terrifying black smoke\!

In an instant, her world turned dark\!

At the same time, an extremely terrifying stench instantly covered her entire head\!

She immediately felt the entire world start to sway…

"Ugh —"

Before she could vomit, Chu Xiaoye had already jumped down from the tree. He wagged his tail and left proudly.

After this, he would go away and hide his identity\!

I am the handsome and cool cub, Chu Xiaoye. I will speak for myself with my super invincible fart\!
