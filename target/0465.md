Chapter 465: The Giant Bird Swallows Fire

In the evening.

The strong wind gathered dark clouds, and the lightning brought thunder. A storm was about to arrive.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and walked through all the borders at his fastest speed, leaving special marks. He only waited for the cold father and the Chino brothers to mark them slowly in the future.

Such weather was not friendly to the three of them.

The sudden rain might immediately wash away the fruits of their labor that they had been busy running around for a day and turn them into nothingness.

From today onwards, they had to go to the border often to mark it, so that their scent would always be left there.

This was an extremely difficult and honorable task.

The cold father liked it very much.

As for the Chino brothers, they had no choice.

When Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine back to the pride's camp, which was the cave under the super huge tree, Alisa had yet to return.

This ambitious and prideful lioness was squatting on a big tree by the river. She narrowed her eyes and looked up at the distant dark sky, welcoming the sweeping wind. She was like a stone sculpture and did not move.

"Whoosh\!"

The sky had just turned dark when a rainstorm fell, beating on the leaves, river, grass, and trees.

Alisa was drenched, but she could not feel it.

"Sss…"

A soft hiss suddenly sounded from behind her, but it was mixed in with the sound of the storm and could not be heard clearly.

A green python had long been hiding on the high ground of this tree. At this moment, it was quietly swimming towards her under the dark night and the violent rain.

A small horn actually grew on the ferocious python head. Its dark and cold vertical eyes flickered with a demonic red light. Its entire body was covered in thick scales. Its thick and long body was wrapped around the tree trunk in circles that could not be seen clearly.

It raised its python head and spat out its scarlet tongue, like a cold killer in the night. With a cold and dark aura, it quietly approached the stunned Alisa.

At this moment, Alisa had long lost her usual sensitivity and sense of smell.

She squatted there and did not move. Her gaze became dull and her expression became wooden. She looked dejected and distracted, not knowing that there was a terrifying cold-blooded killer quietly approaching from behind.

"Whoosh\!"

Three meters away, the ferocious python head suddenly attacked. It jumped out of the head at lightning speed, opened its bloody mouth, and bit Alisa's neck\!

After biting it, he quickly retracted his head.

His movements were extremely fast\!

When Alisa woke up and roared as she turned to pounce, the ferocious python head had already retreated to the branch on it. Its scarlet and cold vertical eyes were staring at her coldly.

Alisa bared her fangs and roared. She prepared to jump up and continue attacking, but she suddenly felt her neck turn numb. The strength she had just accumulated immediately poured out.

Her limbs turned limp and she swayed, almost losing her balance.

She looked up at the treacherous attacker and the scene in her eyes started to overlap. She swayed non-stop, her entire body limp and she could not muster up any strength.

She was poisoned.

The python had horns, fangs, and poisonous teeth. It was different from how pythons used their bodies to kill as weapons in the past.

This was a mutated python\!

Alisa could not stand steadily.

However, she had already bared her fangs, raised her head, and revealed a fierce face.

She could not attack or escape. She could only stand here and welcome death with the most dignified posture of a fierce beast.

The wind roared and the tree swayed non-stop. The rain poured down and drenched her entire body.

She finally could not hold on anymore.

Her body started to tilt and fall down the tree. Even if the python above her stopped attacking, her bones would be broken.

Of course, she would rather fall to her death.

However, the python did not do as she wished.

"Whoosh\!"

The ferocious python head shot over again at lightning speed. This time, it did not bite her neck. Instead, it wrapped around her body and fixed her tightly to the branch under her.

The thick and long body covered in scales quickly slid down and wrapped around her body again. He prepared to break her bones and turn her into a soft ball that was easier to swallow.

Alisa opened her mouth and could not even let out a cry.

She lost.

He did not lose to this python, but to that fellow.

She thought that she had the upper hand, but she never would have thought that a random counterattack from the other party would make her lose her armor and lower her head in a sorry state, unable to resist.

The moment she was roughly and fiercely pressed to the ground by that fellow, she understood that no matter how strong a lioness was, she could not change the instincts in her body and her subconscious obedience to males.

Actually, at that moment, she could continue to struggle and resist.

However, she did not.

She lowered her head and lay on her stomach. She even subconsciously took the initiative to move her tail away, as docile as a little lamb.

It was unbelievable.

"Boom\!"

Thunder rumbled in the pouring rain.

A bolt of lightning cut through the night sky.

The python's body tightened. Its bloody mouth, which was emitting a strong stench, had already arrived in front of her, as if it was preparing to swallow her alive.

Alisa widened her eyes. There was no fear in her heart, only deep frustration and guilt.

"Whoosh\!"

Another bolt of lightning cut through the night sky.

However, there was no deafening thunder, only a pool of cold blood.

The python's entire head flew out like a leaf blown off by a strong wind. Soon, it was submerged in the rain and the night and disappeared.

Cold blood splashed roughly on Alisa's face like a rainstorm falling from the night sky, dying her eyes red. However, it was quickly washed away by the rain.

A figure landed in front of her with the wind and rain. His flickering golden eyes were as dazzling as lightning in the night sky.

Unfortunately, she hated it.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye waved his sharp golden claws and soon, the python wrapped around her body cut into a few pieces and fell.

Alisa could finally breathe, but her entire body was still limp and she was dizzy.

She, who had escaped death, did not seem to be excited or happy at all. Instead, her heart was filled with humiliation and sadness. Now, she, the dignified future queen of the grassland, had actually fallen to such a sorry state. She had actually fallen to become the food of a python and being saved by a fellow who smelled like milk. How laughable was that?

"I'd rather die\!"

Alisa looked at the bad fellow in front of her and shed tears of humiliation.

"Crack\!"

The wind slapped and the branch under him could not withstand the pressure. It suddenly let out a sound that was about to break.

Alisa hurriedly struggled to stand up and raised her two front claws, hugging Chu Xiaoye's neck tightly, but there was no shame in her eyes.

"Even if I have to die, I'll die with you\!"

Of course, Chu Xiaoye did not want to die, let alone die with her.

He raised his head and used the strength of his neck to support this prideful lioness, jumping onto another branch.

Alisa hung in front of his chest. Her entire face was almost buried in his increasingly lush golden mane. She could not help but mutter inwardly, "There's quite a lot of fur."

The rain was fierce on the tree.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down with her.

After landing on the ground, Alisa let go of her claws, but she still wanted to save face and mocked with her gaze. "I knew you wouldn't dare to die\! Coward\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and turned to leave.

Alisa struggled to stand up, but she fell to the ground again with a bang.

The snake venom was very strong. Even with her physique, she could not recover in a short time.

At this moment, if she stayed here alone and encountered any wild beast, her life would be difficult to survive.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at her, clearly expressing his intentions. "Beg me."

If you beg me, I'll stay and accompany you.

Alisa glared and bared her fangs angrily. "In your dreams\!"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and left. Soon, he disappeared into the cold rain.

Alisa stood in place and looked angrily in the direction he had disappeared in. Gradually, the anger on her face turned into a daze, as if she had lost her soul.

She stood there in a daze, looking there in a daze and not moving.

Suddenly, the roar of a wild beast sounded from the grassland not far away.

Alisa immediately woke up.

She did not have the strength to walk far. She could only barely move her feet and crawl into the bushes at the side. She hid inside. Her head was dizzy and her entire body was limp and weak, but she could not sleep.

What happened today completely messed her up.

Her dreams and determination were shaken for the first time today.

Was it really that difficult to become a queen who looked down on the world?

No\! She could not give up\!

No matter how difficult or uncertain it was, she could not give up\!

A failure and loss did not mean anything. Today was just a small setback. She, Alisa, had astonishing talent, great intelligence, and strength. How could she be defeated by such a small failure?

Furthermore, this failure was only a physical failure. Her spirit and soul still stood strong\!

"Smelly fart lion\! Just you wait\! Sooner or later, I, Alisa, will let you understand who is the true king of this grassland? Who is the most qualified to be the true leader of this powerful pride\! Who is the loser who should be suppressed below and roared in humiliation\! Queen Alisa, never to give up\!"

Alisa gritted her teeth, her blood surging. The flames in her eyes burned. Her frustration and sadness from before were swept away and she pulled herself together.

"Whoosh\!"

The bushes behind him suddenly made a noise.

Before she could react, a figure suddenly crawled in from behind with a whoosh and rode on her, pressing her to the ground. The teeth in his mouth bit her neck, making her unable to move, just like how he was during the day.

Alisa was furious\!

She first roared and struggled, then started to roar and curse. Then, she cried and begged.

In the end, she could only cry and bear it silently.

Chu Xiaoye did not feel any guilt. He was only doing what a lion and lion king should do.

If the pride wanted to flourish and strengthen, they had to have their own bloodline. The mating of males and females had to be done many times a day and would last for many days.

Since there was a beginning, they should bear fruits.

Chu Xiaoye had already put down all his burdens and worries and become a true lion.

This pride was his everything.

The wind raged, lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled. This was an uneasy night.

In the distant night, a huge figure was crossing the border of this new territory with a murderous team and walking towards this super tree.

On the giant tree, a black shadow that was like a python was crawling.

In the cave at the bottom of the tree.

The human little girl was sleeping soundly in the tree hole. A smile unconsciously appeared on her exquisite and young face, as if she was having a beautiful dream. Under her golden hair, her two white ears grew longer.

A strange fragrance emitted from the little girl's body and filled the entire tree hole. It silently passed through the ancient bark and crawled into the roots.

Under the violent rain, this huge super ancient tree seemed to have suddenly been woken up. It started to swing its branches like an old demon that had become a spirit, dancing in the dark wind and rain.

The creatures hiding on the branches, between the leaves, and in the canopy were woken up.

A fiery red giant bird covered in flames popped its head out from the dense leaves. It looked dignified and noble, like a legendary phoenix that had long disappeared.

No one knew what was happening in this world or what had already happened. Or, nothing happened. It already existed.

The little girl continued to dream and her body continued to emit a strange fragrance. The fragrance filled the entire tree hole, but it did not spread out from the hole. Small holes that were difficult to see with the naked eye opened on the wooden walls around the tree hole and started to breathe greedily.

"Boom\!"

In the night sky, the violent lightning fiercely hit the huge canopy of this super tree. Just as it started to burn, it was devoured by the fiery red giant bird.

The giant tree was still safe and sound.

The giant bird's feathers became even more fiery and dazzling.

The rain continued for the night.

The pride hid in the space at the bottom of the giant tree and slept comfortably for the night.

After dawn, everything seemed to be calm.

The sun pushed aside the clouds and landed on the ground. The giant tree opened up some gaps benevolently, letting the entire forest enjoy this bright and peaceful moment for a short time.

Chu Xiaoye returned alone, full of energy and high spirits.

Not long after, Alisa returned as well, as if nothing had happened. She was still the arrogant future queen, but there seemed to be an additional mature charm between her brows.

The little girl walked out of the tree hole and waved at Chu Xiaoye from above. She greeted him with her bright eyes and white teeth, looking even more charming.

Her sharp ears were almost revealed from her golden hair.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in a daze. He kept feeling that something was wrong, but he could not remember what it was.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the alarm of the Jerry brothers suddenly came from outside.
