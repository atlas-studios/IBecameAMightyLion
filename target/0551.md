Chapter 551: Trap

Catherine was still leading the way.

Chu Xiaoye brought the five girls and followed behind, paying attention to Catherine's movements.

Soon, the sun set and night fell.

The dangerous forest was not suitable for walking at night.

They had originally planned to rest at night and travel during the day after entering the forest.

However, in order to save them, they had no choice but to continue forward.

Fortunately, Catherine's eyes and Chu Xiaoye's eyes could see things in the distance in the dark night.

After walking for about an hour, Catherine, who was scouting in front, suddenly stopped and jumped onto a big tree at the side. Her dark eyes were cold as she looked ahead and her tail swayed gently.

Chu Xiaoye also vaguely saw the flames in front of him.

"Be careful, Catherine has discovered an orc."

Chu Xiaoye reminded and immediately slowed down with the girls, advancing carefully.

Soon, the noisy chatter of the orcs could be heard clearly.

In the open space not far in front of him, there were two bonfires burning. More than ten orcs were divided into two groups and sat around the fire. They were roasting their prey and talking loudly, looking very excited.

On a big tree beside them were two orc girls tied up. They were very young.

Chu Xiaoye counted carefully. There were thirteen orcs in total. It should not be too difficult to deal with them.

Vilis could not wait.

Chu Xiaoye patted her arm and gestured for her to follow him.

In order to prevent the orcs from threatening the hostages or escaping into the forest to get reinforcements, they had to quickly kill all these orcs.

He and Vilis rushed over to protect the hostages, and Lanisi and the others killed the orcs.

As for Catherine, she jumped onto the tree to prevent any orcs from escaping.

After distributing them, he brought Vilis to the side of the orcs, lowered his body, and quietly approached.

When they were more than ten meters away from the two tied orc girls, an orc suddenly heard a noise and immediately turned around and shouted, "Who is it?"

"Whoosh\!"

Denise's arrow flew over and shot into his mouth that had yet to close. It pierced through the back of his head\!

In fear, the orc suddenly stood up, but his vision turned black. He swayed a few times and fell to the ground.

"Enemy attack\! Enemy attack\!"

The other orcs immediately roared and jumped up, pulling out their weapons.

Lanisi got up from the bushes and rushed towards the orcs under the cover of Denise and Fei'er, attracting their attention.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Vilis, they suddenly got up from the side, held their swords, and quickly rushed over.

"Kill them\!"

The orcs roared and rushed over.

Vilis grabbed Chu Xiaoye's clothes and pulled him behind her. She said angrily, "Move\!"

Then, she unsheathed her huge sword and spun, cutting the orc's body into two from his chest\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Under the light of the two bonfires, Denise and Fei'er's arrows were all very accurate.

Lanisi rushed up with her sword and collided with the iron rod in the hand of an orc, causing a series of fireworks.

The orc was extremely strong. Lanisi felt a pain in her palm and the sword in her hand almost flew out.

"Whoosh\!"

At this moment, Denise's arrow flew past her ear and pierced into the orc's eye.

"Ah —"

The orc cried out miserably and tilted his head back, falling back.

Lanisi took this opportunity to swing the sword in her hand. With a whoosh, she cut off his head.

At this moment, Vilis had already swung their huge swords and rushed into the orc pile, releasing her spinning storm to her heart's content.

Chu Xiaoye quickly ran in front of the tied girl and was about to untie them when he suddenly heard Fei'er scream. He turned around and saw that Fei'er and Denise suddenly lowered their bodies and fell into the trap.

Lanisi was about to rush over to save them when she lost her footing and fell.

Doya, who was following behind with her dagger, could not escape and fell with her.

Chu Xiaoye's expression changed. He hurriedly picked up his sword and ran over. He said loudly, "Catherine, help Vilis kill them\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine jumped down from the tree and swung her silver claws, opening the stomach of one of the orcs.

However, just as she landed, a rope suddenly jumped up from the ground. With a whoosh, it wrapped around her limbs and hung her in midair.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He immediately changed directions and ran towards Catherine.

However, something even more shocking happened. Vilis, who was chasing the last two orcs, actually stepped on the rope and was hung upside down. The sword in her hand fell to the ground without warning.

When the two fleeing orcs saw this, they immediately turned around and returned. They roared as they swung their maces and blades at Vilis, who was hanging in midair.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye ran away at his fastest speed and suddenly jumped up, slashing with the sword in his hand\!

"Bang\!"

Sparks flew. The mace and saber raised by the two orcs were actually cut by the sword in his hand\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and suddenly turned around. He drew a circle with the sword in his hand and actually cut off the heads of the two orcs with a whoosh.

Blood sprayed and the last two orcs finally fell.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not relax at all.

Because he suddenly smelled an even more dangerous aura.

"Roar—"

A figure suddenly jumped out of the bushes at the side and pounced at him\!

Sharp fangs were revealed in its bloody mouth\!

It was a huge lion\!

Chu Xiaoye swung his sword and slashed at its face\!

When he cut open the lion's head, another equally huge lion jumped out from the bushes at the side.

At the same time, Vilis shouted from above, "Behind you\!"

A strong wind rose behind him and his roar was like thunder\!

The two lions attacked from both sides\!

After Chu Xiaoye cut open the head of the first lion, he immediately rolled to the left and avoided the two lions that pounced over one after another.

He held his sword and retreated under the tree.

More lions walked out of the bushes. Roughly counting, there were about ten of them.

These did not scare Chu Xiaoye.

After the ten-over lions walked out, strong orcs also walked out of the forest.

Their chests were bare and their faces were fierce. They had a strong smell of blood on them and all sorts of scars on their bodies and faces, like a group of ferocious bandits who had just slaughtered their prey.

They walked out of the forest in all directions and surrounded the place. There were at least 200 people.

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and leaned against the tree. For the first time since he became an elf, he felt fear.

He was not afraid for himself.

For these ferocious orcs, Lanisi and the others, who had fallen into the trap and were hanging in midair, were like delicious prey and already bound prey.

"Shortie\! Go\!"

Vilis, who was suspended in midair, suddenly spoke.
