Chapter 113: The Hacking Tiger

Evening.

A red sun hung on the horizon.

The grassland was golden.

However, no one here had the leisure to enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature.

The pride of the cold father was still in fear.

The strange death of the lioness with a broken tail made the remaining four female lions feel sad and terrified.

As for the cold father.

Seno's tragic death did not make him feel relaxed. Instead, it made him feel even more uneasy.

What exactly killed them?

However.

Soon, their bodies and consciousness were occupied by hunger.

It seemed that there was no hope for food on the tree.

Perhaps that kid wanted to keep it and enjoy it alone.

Although the cold father and the female lions were very dissatisfied, he was the one who got the food after all.

Furthermore, they could not get it.

Therefore, when the sky turned dark, they decided to set off to hunt and try their luck.

Perhaps he could catch a few prey and eat them.

After the sun set.

They immediately got up and set off.

They also seemed to know that there was a huge danger hiding in the bushes at the back. Therefore, when they went out this time, they did not walk from there but walked straight to the grassland.

Looking at their backs as they left, Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered, but he did not stop them.

Maya stayed behind to take care of the two young cubs.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and then at the bushes behind her. He recalled the scene when the figure was preparing to attack.

It would never let the matter rest\!

Now that the cold father had left with the female lions, there was only one adult female lion and the other cubs left in the camp.

It would definitely appear again\!

Chu Xiaoye called for Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine to come over.

He could not speak and could only use simple communication to express his intentions.

He brought them to the forest behind Maya and stopped in front of a big tree, signaling Little Curly Tail to climb up and hide.

The leaves on this tree were still lush and green. Although they were all needle-shaped leaves, if one lay on it and did not move, it would be difficult to discover an animal walking under the tree.

The injuries on Little Curly Tail's legs had already recovered. It was easy for him to climb up and down the tree now.

He immediately climbed up and hid behind the dense leaves, looking down.

He could tell that his brother was preparing to ambush the enemy.

Chu Xiaoye walked under a big tree in front of him and gestured for Mei Mei to climb to the highest point to hide.

This way, he could discover the attacker as soon as possible.

After Mei Mei climbed up the tree to hide, Chu Xiaoye immediately brought Catherine to the bushes at the side to find withered leaves. He picked them up with his mouth and sprinkled them evenly in the grass that led behind Maya.

In order to discover the attacker as much as possible, he bit the withered branch into small pieces and expanded the coverage.

This way, once the attacker approached, he might step on these withered leaves and make sounds in the quiet night.

After doing all this, he immediately brought Catherine, one on the left and one on the right, and crawled into the two bushes behind Maya, staring outside.

From time to time, he would look up at Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei on the tree.

If the attacker appeared, they would be the first to discover him.

Maya thought that they were playing and ignored them. She did not dare to let the two young cubs go over.

She lay there with her eyes closed.

The night was very quiet.

On this dry night, there were almost no sounds of insects.

The forest was dark and gloomy.

Time passed bit by bit.

Soon, it was late at night.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei hid on the tree and waited patiently, watching the wind and grass below meticulously.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, they also hid in the bushes and did not dare to be careless.

Not only did they have to look at the ground, but they also looked up at the tree from time to time.

However, there was no movement in the bushes.

The night quietly passed.

Soon, the sky in the east started to turn white.

Chu Xiaoye did not know if he was disappointed or relieved. Just as he was about to climb out of the bushes, he suddenly saw Mei Mei hiding on the big tree at the front. Her tail moved.

His heart tightened as he looked into the distance with a burning gaze.

"Crack\!"

A slight noise came from the bushes in front.

It was the sound of withered branches\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail, who was hiding on a nearby tree, also moved his tail and tensed up. He had clearly discovered something.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the bushes and held his breath. He did not move and stared intently at the dark forest.

Soon, the tall figure covered in black and yellow patterns lowered his body and quietly sneaked over like a ghost in the night.

It tiptoed and walked very slowly. It paused after taking every step carefully.

When it stepped on a withered branch, it immediately stopped and pricked up its ears. After listening to the surroundings for a while, it continued to slowly move forward.

Twenty meters\!

Ten meters\!

Five meters\!

Chu Xiaoye saw it getting closer and closer. Its strong and mighty body and dark and cold eyes emitted a terrifying and powerful aura that almost suffocated him\!

"Whoosh—"

When it reached three meters away and suddenly stopped, Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and suddenly rushed out\!

He could not get any closer\!

This ferocious beast's gaze was already observing these two bushes\!

It seemed to have started to be vigilant\!

The moment Chu Xiaoye rushed out, Catherine immediately rushed out of the bushes at lightning speed\!

She suddenly passed him and rushed to the front. With a whoosh, she jumped up high and pounced ferociously at the beast\!

At this moment, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were hiding on the tree, immediately rushed down from the tree at their fastest speed, preparing to cut off this enemy's retreat\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Catherine, who had just pounced in front of the tiger, was slapped by the tiger's claws and sent flying, landing miserably on the ground\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye bared his fangs and pounced ferociously\!

The tiger suddenly jumped up, turned around, and slapped him hard on the head with its thick and long tail\!

An intense pain came from his head\!

Chu Xiaoye could not help but tilt his head and fall heavily to the ground. He immediately felt dizzy and saw stars\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei also roared and pounced from behind\!

This forest king looked at them coldly and suddenly took a few steps forward. With a whoosh, it jumped up high and flew over their heads\!

Then, with a few leaps, he immediately disappeared into the dense bushes and the boundless night.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were stunned.

Catherine got up from the ground and rushed shakily to Chu Xiaoye's side.

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and got up from the grass.

There was a deep wound on his forehead.

Catherine's claws trembled slightly and her dark eyes, which were as deep as the night sky, revealed a cold glint.

That damn bastard actually dared to hurt him\!

It was bad enough that she hurt him, but she actually dared to disfigure him\!

He could not be forgiven\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at her, turned around, and returned to the camp.

He walked under the Baobab tree and extended his claws to draw an arrow from the grass.

This arrow had once almost pierced through his hind legs.

He looked up at the bushes not far from Maya.

Since it was so big, he could not be blamed for opening a bigger one\!
