Chapter 215: The Queen's Death

A new leader was born.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front.

Catherine and Blue followed behind him on the left and right.

The female lion that had survived the edge of death followed silently behind them, seemingly having already submitted to this young king.

The two strong warthogs followed closely.

As for the three lions, they followed at the back.

They were a little hesitant.

This young lion did save their lives.

However, this did not mean that they would submit to him.

They were the experts of the grassland and majestic lions.

If they wanted to make them submit, just showing kindness was not enough. They had to have great strength and the aura of a king that terrified them.

This young lion had never defeated any lion king in front of them, not even them.

Therefore, they naturally would not recognize him as king.

They would only submit to the strong\!

However, there was no problem using him as the leader of the team for the time being.

The sun could only light up the top of the tree.

The forest was still dark and humid. No light could be seen.

The old tree was like a demon and thick like a python. Leaves were piled up and the stench of decay filled the air.

This was like an ancient primitive forest.

The smell left behind by the mixed fur lion king did not completely disappear.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and followed the lion king's aura.

After all, the other party was the true leader of this team and the pen bird was also stopping on him. Any news on the snow mountain had to pass through him to be conveyed.

It was only right to kill the enemy.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not want to keep wandering around like a headless fly.

Only the lion king knew the exact steps.

Therefore, he had to find him.

In the mud ahead, the corpse of a strange fish floated.

The monster's head was bitten to pieces.

Beside the pool, the aura of the mixed fur lion king was still lingering.

Clearly, the lion king had finally obtained its first merit.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and continued forward.

His goal was very simple. He wanted to find the mixed fur lion king, find the enemy, complete the mission, and leave this place.

However, some fellows always liked to disturb him.

They liked to come uninvited. They liked to cause trouble and kill each other.

Of course, they preferred to overestimate their capabilities and seek death.

The hyenas that had suffered heavy losses with the pride last night suddenly walked out of the forest beside them under the lead of the hyena queen and blocked their path.

Obviously, they had waited for a long time.

Furthermore, they knew that the powerful lion king had already left.

They did not forget the blood feud last night.

After a night of recuperation, they returned and prepared to destroy them one by one.

A pride without a lion king was inferior to a hyena without a queen.

Because the latter might be like a plate of loose sand, but they still had strong combat strength, and the former's combat strength and courage had greatly weakened.

If a pride lost its lion king, they would not be far from death.

This was the eternal truth of the grassland.

In the hyena queen's opinion, the only one who was really a threat to her was the mixed fur lion king.

Now, the mixed fur lion king had already left. The three lions and one female lion in this pride were already injured and had no combat strength. They could only be slaughtered by them\!

She had personally bitten these three lions last night, so she knew their injuries clearly.

After dealing with this place, it would be easy to deal with the lion king that had become a lone lion\!

How could she miss such a good opportunity?

"Ahhh â€”"

The hyena queen immediately shouted and personally led her subordinates up.

After the battle last night, there were still fifteen spotted hyenas left.

However, it was enough.

She flicked out her sharp claws, her eyes revealing strong confidence.

When a spotted hyena had the claws and strength of a lion, it would be a terrifying thing\!

During this period of time, there were eight or ten wandering lions that died under her claws\!

She loved to see the shock and disbelief on the faces of those lions who thought they were strong when their stomachs were cut open by a hyena like her.

Her feelings could only be described with one word-satisfying\!

Now, the three lions, oh no, four lions in front of her would all wail in despair and fear under her sharp claws\!

The hyenas split up and surrounded the team without the lion king guarding it, letting out noisy and provocative cries.

But.

It was strange.

The hyena queen looked at the pride in confusion, feeling that something was wrong.

Why did these injured people who had been abandoned by the mixed fur lion king not seem to be afraid or panicked at all?

Furthermore, why was the youngest lion walking in front?

It seemed that even the two pigs and the three lions followed him as their leader.

His calmness puzzled her.

However, who cares.

Since the mixed fur lion king was not here, what was there to be afraid of?

She wanted to end the battle quickly and leave none alive\!

"Ah â€”"

However, just as she opened her mouth and made a sound, the young lion suddenly rushed towards her like lightning with a whoosh\!

It was very fast\!

The hyena queen was shocked and immediately swallowed the cry behind her. Then, she suddenly jumped up and raised her sharp claws\!

Little thing, you're biting off more than you can chew\!

She gathered all her strength on her raised right claw, her eyes filled with cold ridicule. She prepared to perform a free C-section on this young lion\!

"Bang\!"

The two claws collided heavily\!

The hyena queen grinned and let out a hoarse cry, as if she was laughing coldly.

She suddenly pulled down, preparing to move her claws to the young lion king's neck. Then, she went down and opened its stomach\!

However, she suddenly felt her claws lighten and all her strength disappeared instantly\!

"Bam\!"

She landed on the ground, and her claws and entire foot were splashed with blood as she flew out.

She could not stand steadily and fell to the ground. There was only a bare leg that was like a stick left on her right front leg and she was vomiting blood crazily.

She lay on the ground, feeling a little lost.

However, she quickly jumped up again\!

She endured the pain and turned around. She opened her mouth and let out a miserable roar. She pounced ferociously at the young lion\!

She was desperate and unwilling\!

However, just as she turned around and jumped up, a figure suddenly rushed over from behind and suddenly pierced her neck with a claw. With a whoosh, it pulled down and cut her neck and entire abdomen open\!

She fell to the ground helplessly. Blood and internal organs surged out of her abdomen, instantly dying the grass red and flowing all over the ground.

She turned her head trembling and looked at the figure beside her.

A silver claw, a childish face, and a pair of cold and terrifying black eyes.

It was the young lioness cub.

It turned out that this lioness cub had given her a free C-section.

The hyena queen opened her mouth with a tremble, as if she wanted to make a sound, but she only twitched a few times. Her body turned limp and she completely stopped breathing.

After a short silence, the other hyenas around him suddenly let out a scream and fled in fear.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine stood in front of the hyena queen's corpse and lowered their heads to look at each other's claws.

Then, they raised their heads in tacit understanding and looked at each other.

Their gazes met and they were as clear as water.

At this moment.

The three lions, the female lion, and the two warthogs stood in place in a daze, looking at them.
