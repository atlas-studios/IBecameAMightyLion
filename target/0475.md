Chapter 475: Coward\!

The sky was starting to brighten.

Blue Eyes, who had been patrolling outside the bushes for the night, opened his mouth and yawned. He stopped in place for a while before continuing to patrol against the cool wind.

He would occasionally let out a few hoarse roars at the distant darkness to remind and warn the competitors and tramps wandering around the territory. This territory had long had an owner.

The night was peaceful.

Blue Eyes looked into the distance and turned to return.

After a busy night, he should go back and rest.

He could sleep for the entire day during the day and continue to patrol at night.

He thought of his young and powerful king.

His king had lost all his fur and had not come out for a month. Every member of the pride was worried.

Of course, he was also very worried.

That young lion was not only the leader of this pride, but also their spiritual leader. On this unfamiliar and dangerous grassland, if they did not have him, they would not be able to survive.

Fortunately, nothing happened during this period of time.

The surrounding neighbors were also peaceful. Occasionally, some ordinary small battles were resolved with everyone's joint efforts.

However, this was not a solution.

Although Little Curly Tail had performed very well during this period of time and had the demeanor of a leader, his strength and intelligence could not be compared to that of a king.

Even with their loyal support, it was not a long-term solution.

Every day, everyone silently hoped that the king could pull himself together and continue to lead them to fight everywhere on this grassland, expand their borders, and be mighty.

No lion did not want to emit the most dazzling light in their lives.

He was in his prime.

The other lions were also full of energy and ambition. It was time to show their ambition and fight.

He believed that as long as their young lion king was willing, all the land and pride on this grassland would be conquered by their strength and unity.

Blue eyes carried dreams and longing as they walked into the bushes.

At this moment, the night had already retreated.

The morning sun was about to rise and shone on the clouds on the horizon, as if it was burning.

Blue Eyes suddenly stopped and woke up from his fantasy. His ears twitched and his eyes revealed suspicion. He turned around and looked at the bushes on the right.

Was it the wind?

"Whoosh\!"

A huge iron claw suddenly enlarged in his eyes\!

He could not dodge in time.

"Bang\!"

There was a muffled sound of bones breaking.

His body, which was more than 500 kilograms, actually flew out like fallen leaves and fell heavily into a patch of thorns full of sharp thorns.

His skull collapsed and his face was covered in blood. His vision was scarlet, like a burning cloud on the horizon that covered his eyes.

He tried his best to open his eyes and see the huge attacker clearly.

His entire body was covered in terrifying patterns, his dignified eyebrows, his powerful aura, and the two long teeth that were as sharp as ivory at the corner of his mouth. The gaze he looked at him with was cold and disdain.

"Roarâ€”"

Blood covered his eyes and the darkness devoured his soul. He used his last bit of strength and let out a weak roar.

The enemy was here.

Not far away, Mixed Fur, who had just returned from patrolling, heard his voice clearly.

An even louder and rapid roar came from Mixed Fur's mouth.

Mixed Fur did not hesitate at all. After letting out the alarm, it immediately ran towards the hole at the bottom of the tree.

He could tell that his old friend was in danger and was probably roaring before he died.

To be able to sneak into this forest silently and give his old friend a fatal blow, one could imagine how terrifying the enemy's strength was.

He had to return to the camp and fight side by side with all the members of the pride\!

"Roar â€”"

In another direction, the roar of the male leopard, Blue, suddenly sounded.

The leopard family of four started to flee quickly on the tree. They looked panicked and encountered another strong enemy.

The situation was critical\!

The enemy was strong and their numbers were unknown.

When the other members who were moving outside the cave heard the anxious alarms, they did not hesitate and immediately returned to the hole at the bottom of the tree.

There were a total of three entrances and exits from the cave at the bottom of the tree. They had to guard the entrance and not let the enemy take another step\!

When Mixed Fur ran back at its fastest speed, Blue's family of four happened to run into the cave and were roaring anxiously.

"There are many enemies\!"

The family of four expressed their intentions clearly.

The members of the pride started to be nervous.

Only Blue Eyes was gone.

Mixed Fur felt sad.

He knew that the weak roar just now should be his old friend's last farewell before he died.

Mixed Fur guarded in front of the first hole, and the sadness in his eyes quickly turned fierce and ferocious. He bared his sharp claws and fangs and let out an angry roar, preparing to welcome the ferocious and terrifying enemy.

Little Curly Tail came behind him and guarded the entrance with him.

Mei Mei and Molly also came.

The cold father, Maya, Aisha, and Xi'er came over.

Even the two young cubs followed and bravely bared their sharp fangs.

The cute violent bear and her son guarded the second hole, their round and fat bodies blocking it.

The three warthogs stood behind them, and even Little Mi stood there.

The Jerry brothers also walked over.

The leopard family of four guarded the third hole.

They could have hidden on the tree and not taken the risk to enter. With their ability on the tree, the enemy would not do anything to them. Furthermore, the enemy was clearly not coming for them.

However, when they saw the enemy and heard the alarm, they did not hesitate at all and still rushed over without hesitation, preparing to help the pride resist the enemy.

Alisa walked behind them.

Every member of the pride took the initiative to find their positions and prepared to give up everything for this pride.

Except their king.

Wait, there was also the big black bear, its owner, and Catherine, who had been guarding the entrance of the tree hole motionless like a stone sculpture and did not allow anyone to enter.

The big black bear stood in the middle of the cave and looked left and right. It took a step forward and then took a step back. It cowered and did not dare to go anywhere.

It could only raise its head and blink its flustered little eyes to look up.

However, its god of spirit and strength, the little girl, did not appear.

Even when they heard the uneasy and anxious roars of the pride.

The tree hole above was quiet.

All the members could not help but turn around and look up, their eyes flickering.

At the most critical moment of the survival of the pride, their king and the human girl were still hiding in the dark cave, seemingly not even interested in coming out to take a look.

Without his mane and fur, did he also lose his courage and strength?

Disappointment and frustration, fear and sadness, and all sorts of emotions quietly spread throughout the pride in this dark and cold cave under the tree.

"Coward\!"

Alisa looked up, feeling disappointed and angry.
