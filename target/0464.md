Chapter 464: The Indisputable King\!

"Whoosh…"

The urine landed and the border was formed.

A new territory was finally born\!

The cold father raised his head and stuck out his chest. He continued to mark the territory excitedly and solemnly with his pungent urine.

With the river beside the super huge tree as the starting point, there was a distance of about 6 kilometers from here to the end.

The territory was not big.

However, this was enough for Chu Xiaoye's pride.

The wider the territory, the greater the danger.

Furthermore, every patrol and marking of the territory was an extremely tiring and dangerous task.

The grass was lush here, bushes were gathered, and food and resources were abundant. There were foraging herbivores everywhere, and it was enough for them to survive for the time being.

As a newcomer, he naturally had to stand firm and develop slowly. He could not be impatient.

The task of marking the territory was naturally handed to the cold father and the Chino brothers.

The cold father recommended himself and was happy to show off. As for the Chino brothers, they probably only had this little use.

After Chu Xiaoye assigned the daily patrol team, he let Little Curly Tail bring the pride back to the bushes with super huge trees. That was their camp. Although it was a little strange and eerie, it was at least safer than this grassland.

Little Curly Tail was already an adult. Unknowingly, he had already caught up to the cold father. It was time to let him be alone.

Mei Mei and Molly followed behind him on the left and right, like his two bodyguards.

However, these two young female lions seemed to look down on him from the bottom of their hearts. He had to work harder to show his strength and the charm that a lion should have, like his beloved brother, the Myriad Lion.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and prepared to patrol in another direction. At the same time, he decided on the exact location of the border of the territory in that direction. He left his scent and waited for the mark of the cold father and the Chino brothers.

It was naturally the responsibility of a lion king to divide territory.

Alisa came uninvited and deliberately walked in front of him. She raised her head and strode forward, twisting her butt as if she was the king here.

On the grass not far away, a group of beautiful zebras were wagging their tails and eating grass.

Chu Xiaoye and the other two did not deliberately hide and walked over casually.

The zebra that was keeping watch immediately ran and let out a neigh, informing its companions that danger was approaching.

The zebras immediately dispersed and fled with their hooves raised.

When the zebras fled in a direction, there was a female zebra at the center of their gathering. She was still standing in place in a daze, her eyes bulging. She did not escape.

Behind her knelt a young zebra.

The little zebra was still covered in blood and did not have the strength to stand up for a moment. It had a confused and blank expression. Clearly, it had just given birth.

The female zebra rested for a moment and immediately woke up. She hurriedly turned around and used her mouth to arch the little zebra's body, urging it to quickly stand up and escape.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye and the other two had already arrived less than ten meters away from them.

At this distance, not to mention a newborn zebra, even a strong and fast male zebra could not escape.

The female zebra was clearly aware of her and her child's situation. She was still using her mouth to push the little zebra hard. She let out a trembling cry, as if she was begging and praying.

The zebra finally stood up and wagged its tail. It strode with its limbs and looked excited, but it did not escape. Instead, it walked under the female zebra's abdomen and wanted to drink milk.

The female zebra raised her head and looked at the three approaching predators. She moved her feet in fear, but she seemed to hesitate for a moment. In the end, she did not escape. Instead, she stood there motionless and let the little zebra drink milk.

It seemed to know that it could not escape calamity.

It raised its head and looked calmly at the predator in front of it, like a warrior who had generously died, or a mother who had already given up on resisting in despair.

On the grassland, under such circumstances, even zebras with overflowing maternal love would immediately abandon their children and flee alone because they were afraid and helpless.

They did not have the ability to resist and protect. They could only escape alone, even if they could not escape.

Because that was their instinct.

Now, this female zebra was standing here, quietly feeding the child she had just given birth to, calmly waiting for death to arrive.

Clearly, the changes in the world had increased their intelligence and feelings.

These feelings were usually fatal to animals like them who were in danger and struggling to survive every day.

Alisa walked in front and looked back at Chu Xiaoye. She did not seem to be asking, but looking at him and observing something.

The food they had just eaten last night was not hungry at this time, but if a lion encountered easy prey and did not kill it, it might become a joke and a freak.

Such a freak was not qualified to be the leader of the pride.

Alisa seemed to be observing him the entire time.

This smart lioness seemed to have long seen through his useless personality hidden under his fierce appearance.

Being soft-hearted was useless, being merciful was useless. To lions,

Lion King wanted to be ruthless and have no mercy.

She thought that she was more suitable to be the leader of this pride than this cowardly fellow.

"Perhaps, you should be like that little fellow and go over to lie at the female zebra's crotch. Put away your fangs and claws, remove your useless golden mane, and suck its breast, becoming a docile and pitiful little thing."

Alisa narrowed her eyes and grinned brazenly.

"You should drink milk, not meat and blood\!"

"Of course\!"

Chu Xiaoye's answer was very timely and simple.

However, he looked very fierce and terrifying. He did not look like a male or king with a gentleman's demeanor at all.

"Whoosh\!"

He rushed over, bared his fangs and claws, and had a fierce expression.

He pushed Alisa to the ground and pressed her back tightly. His sharp fangs bit her neck and his two sharp claws grabbed her slender body.

He wanted to eat her.

Since he had a new territory and had become a true lion and lion king, since it had already happened once, what was there to hesitate and be ashamed of?

The responsibility of the lion king was to guard the territory and reproduce.

He was only solemnly and strictly fulfilling his duties.

Of course, he had to let this female cub know clearly and completely that he was the king here\! An indisputable, unquestionable king\!

"Roar —"

Alisa was caught off guard. After lying on the ground, she was completely dumbfounded, as if she had suddenly forgotten to resist.

Chu Xiaoye's golden mane swayed under the sun like waves rolling on the sea.

Catherine stood in place in a daze.

The zebra mother and son took this opportunity to escape.

Perhaps, in the female zebra's heart, she was thinking of an extremely serious question: Could it be that all males lived for their lower bodies?
