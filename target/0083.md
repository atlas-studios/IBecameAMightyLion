Chapter 83: Revenge

"Roar—"

The cold father's furious roar sounded in the dark grassland\!

The female lions followed closely.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei and quickly followed them.

Catherine got up from the bushes and followed the figure silently in the moonlight.

Beside the bushes.

Callie seemed to have gone crazy. Her eyes were red as she bit the three hyenas.

Baley raised his head and looked viciously at the lion running over angrily with its mane flying in the distance. He called out coldly and walked towards the bushes.

The two hyenas who were eating cubs quickly put down the food in their mouths and followed.

As for the other three hyenas, they were bitten by the crazy Callie and were covered in wounds and blood. They could not leave.

Baley looked at them coldly and ignored them.

When the cold father rushed over with the female lions and young cubs, he had already walked into the bushes and stopped beside a bush, looking at the pride coldly.

He would return after he united the hyenas.

In a battle between old enemies, one side would eventually be defeated and retreat, leaving this place forever\!

The cold father roared as he charged towards the three male hyenas beside Callie\!

The other lionesses also charged forward angrily.

The three male hyenas tried their best to escape, but they were bitten by Callie, who was riddled with injuries and could not leave.

Baley looked at his three companions for the last time, then crawled into the bushes and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye looked at his back and felt that the gaze of this male hyena just now was not something an animal on the grassland should have.

He was too human-like.

The three male hyenas that did not have the time to escape were soon bitten in the throat by the cold father and the other female lions and pressed to the ground.

Callie stood in place, baring her fangs, her entire body covered in wounds and trembling.

Chu Xiaoye walked towards her and prepared to lick her wounds.

Suddenly, he saw a furry corpse lying in the grass beside him\!

It was the corpse of a cub\!

There was only a bloody half of the corpse left\!

"Buzz —"

Chu Xiaoye's mind buzzed as he finally understood.

The lioness's roar and tremble were not because of fear, but because of her child.

Her newborn child was bitten to death by hyenas and even eaten in front of her.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail's angry growl suddenly came from the side.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look and his heart trembled. He walked over quickly.

What greeted his eyes were the corpses of two bloody cubs.

The air suddenly froze.

He could barely breathe.

Mei Mei quietly came to his side and looked at the cub's corpse, her body trembling.

Catherine stood not far away and did not dare to come over.

When the pregnant Maya saw this miserable scene, she did not know if she was grieving for her sister or if it was because of fear, but she almost could not stand steadily.

Xi'er walked over silently and stood beside Callie, rubbing her head gently against her body to comfort her.

Callie was still baring her fangs and roaring hoarsely. She stood in place, as if she had lost her soul.

The three male hyenas had their necks bitten off.

The cold father got up and walked over. He looked at the three young cubs' corpses on the ground in silence and coldness.

Aisha and the other lionesses walked over too. Their expressions were sad and their eyes were filled with pity.

It was a tragic night.

At least for this pride.

A strong smell of blood filled the empty grassland.

Soon, some hungry carnivores would come and enjoy the delicious food that had been abandoned.

Callie's eyes were blank as she silently walked towards the corpse of a young cub. She lowered her head and sniffed in a daze. Then, she opened her mouth.

She wanted to bury her children in her body.

They were born in her body and would be buried in her body.

She and her children would never be separated.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the distant grassland.

The night was vast and boundless.

Life was like this vast grassland. It was full of life and also withered.

Not every life could wait for the rainy season.

This land gave them hope and despair. It gave them life but also made them die. Every day, all sorts of comedies and tragedies happened.

It was too difficult to live.

It would be even more difficult to survive.

The cold father left with the pride.

Three male hyenas' corpses were left on the grass.

They only wanted to live.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the camp and climbed onto the Baobab tree. He lay on the highest branch and looked at the night sky, the moon, and the grassland in a daze.

Under the tree.

In the bushes not far away.

Catherine lay there and looked at the tree, the moon, and him lying on the moon in a daze.

The night grew darker.

The sadness could not be eliminated. It was like a nightmare that lingered in the minds of Callie and the entire pride.

They lay in the grass with their eyes closed, but they could not fall asleep.

Suddenly.

Chu Xiaoye climbed down from the Baobab tree.

He used his gaze to stop Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were about to follow him down the tree and walked straight to the bushes at the back.

Aisha opened her eyes and glanced at him. She thought that he was going to the back to relieve himself, so she did not mind.

Catherine quietly got up, crawled into the bushes at the back, and followed him.

She felt that there was something wrong with him tonight.

She was very worried.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes and followed the path he had previously walked out of the forest in the distance.

That was the direction of the hyena pack's camp.

He raised his head, and his amber eyes flickered with a dark and cold light in the night.

He walked very quickly and did not look back.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"The big smelly fart is here\! The big smelly fart is here\! Don't come\! Don't come\!"

When he passed through the orchard, Belita, who was lying on a fruit tree, immediately stood up and let out a fierce scream. She rudely and unreasonably let him leave.

This orchard was hers\!

Her mother, the big female leopard, lay on another fruit tree and immediately looked at the familiar figure uneasily.

She could keenly smell the cold murderous aura on this cub.

"Don't provoke him\! Don't provoke him\!"

She looked anxiously at her silly daughter.

Belita did not know anything and was still roaring at the figure. Seeing that he was ignoring her, she immediately bit down on a fruit angrily and threw it down.

The fruit landed in front of Chu Xiaoye.

He ignored them and did not look up at the little leopard. Instead, he left directly.

Belita was stunned and looked at him in a daze.

She originally thought that this cub was going to bully her again, but he actually left without even looking up.

Where was he going?

At this moment, another female cub entered the orchard and followed behind him.

The little lioness was acting suspiciously and definitely had ill intentions towards him.

Belita decided to follow and take a look.
