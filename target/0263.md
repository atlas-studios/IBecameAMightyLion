Chapter 263: The Powerful Black Lion

"Roar—"

The battle started\!

Chu Xiaoye brought six lions and surrounded the big tree where the pride of the cold father was hiding. They formed a circle to guard against the sneak attacks from behind these black lions.

The main attack of these black lions was the brothers, Jerry.

The Jerry brothers looked taller and more ferocious, so at the beginning, the two brothers attracted the most firepower.

The black lion pounced at them together.

Only two black lions were pouncing on Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye knew in his heart that these black lions were definitely not the brothers' match. However, there were too many enemies. With the brothers' huge bodies, they would suffer more attacks.

Two fists could not defeat four hands, let alone claws and sharp teeth\!

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to lure a portion of the black lions away. This way, the pressure on the six lions would immediately decrease a lot.

When the two black lions pounced ferociously, Chu Xiaoye did not hide anything. He raised his two golden claws and jumped up\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

The two ferocious black lions' skulls broke and they fell to the ground, instantly dying\!

This scene immediately attracted the attention of the other black lions sprinting behind.

"Roar—"

The black lions suddenly changed directions and rushed towards him.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up, passed them, and landed on the back of a black lion. He then jumped up and landed behind the black pride, rushing out of the encirclement.

He did not escape. Instead, he immediately turned around and returned, attacking from behind\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The few black lions roaring from behind had their spines broken by his slaps and they fell to the ground.

The other black lions immediately turned around and roared as they charged at him\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Golden claws danced and blood splashed everywhere\!

One black lion's head after another was cut in half\!

One black lion corpse after another fell to the ground\!

At this moment.

The eight female lions on the tree were also dealt with. They fell down and died on the spot\!

Catherine, Tilly, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei jumped down from the tree and rushed into the black lion's army like wolves entering a herd of sheep, killing crazily\!

The six tall lions guarded steadily around the tree, not giving the other party any chance to break through.

The weak Lars stood with the Chino brothers. Although this big brother was not strong, he was very fierce and brave, biting back one enemy after another.

In order to protect him, the Chino brothers were bitten by the black lions a few times in their panic. Their bloodthirst and dominance were immediately bitten. They actually took the initiative to rush out, pounced on the two black lions, and started biting crazily.

If Little Curly Tail had not jumped down from the tree in time to save them, the two brothers would have been bitten to death by the other black lions that rushed up.

The cold father roared endlessly from the tree. He wanted to come down and fight, but because he was afraid of heights, his entire body was trembling and he almost peed his pants.

Catherine's silver claws continued to open her stomach.

Chu Xiaoye and Tilly's golden claws were invincible. With a random claw, their skin and flesh would be lacerated and their bones would shatter\!

In a moment, this black pride with more than twenty lions had suffered heavy casualties and only a dozen or so were left.

The female lions were all killed\!

The remaining lions finally felt fear and had the intention to retreat.

As for the black lion king, half of its face was grabbed by the blue eye and it rolled on the ground in pain.

The blue eye roared angrily and pounced over, biting his throat\!

"Whoosh—"

Right at this moment, a black shadow suddenly rushed out of the pride. It jumped and suddenly slapped the blue eye's head\!

Its speed was as fast as lightning\!

"Bang\!"

The blue eyes were caught off guard and their heads were slapped\!

The huge body actually flew out and fell heavily to the ground, unable to get up for a long time.

This scene immediately frightened the mixed fur lion king beside him.

The mixed fur lion king immediately roared angrily and rushed up to save him, pouncing on the black lion.

The black lion was slightly smaller than the other black lions. It looked ordinary and was not outstanding.

However, the speed and strength he unleashed just now was exceptionally terrifying\!

"Roar—"

The mixed fur lion king roared and pounced forward\!

The black lion immediately retreated to dodge. When the mixed fur lion king's claws missed and its body landed on the ground, he actually instantly rushed close and suddenly swung his claws\!

"Bang\!"

The mixed fur lion king was also sent flying and landed miserably beside the blue-eyed lion king. Its vision immediately turned black and it fainted\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked to see this scene and hurriedly rushed over.

The sudden performance of the black lion not only shocked them, but also his companions.

They had never seen this companion so powerful\!

However, this also restored their confidence\!

They roared again and started attacking\!

However, their strength was far inferior to that of the black lion. Soon, their flesh and blood were sent flying by Little Curly Tail and the others as they fled in panic\!

Chu Xiaoye protected his blue eyes and mixed fur as he looked solemnly at the black lion in front of him.

This black lion's appearance was no different from that of other black lions, but Chu Xiaoye had seen his eyes filled with human emotions.

That tiger once had such eyes\!

Although Chu Xiaoye was much stronger than before, the shadow that the tiger had left on him still had not disappeared.

"Whoosh\!"

He did not hesitate and immediately rushed towards the black lion in front of him\!

If this black lion was really like that tiger and had other genes planted by humans, then there might be a tracking device hidden on its body that could allow humans to grasp its location and movements at any time.

Back then, the tiger was killed by them. Even if he was careful and buried the corpse underground, humans still came.

If he did not kill this black lion today, his team members would probably be exposed to danger.

Therefore, he could not let this black lion leave\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and let Tilly and Catherine come over to help and block the black lion's retreat.

The other black lions had already been killed until they were terrified and had no fighting spirit. They were fleeing in panic.

As for this black lion, it was still calm and composed, not showing any panic.

Obviously, he was very confident in his strength and escape ability.

When Chu Xiaoye rushed up and swung his claws, wanting to test his true strength, he immediately retreated and turned to leave without hesitation.

Chu Xiaoye immediately chased after them with Catherine and Tilly.

Of the other black lions, only two escaped. The rest fell to the ground and could not stand up again.

When Chu Xiaoye and the other two chased after the black lion and quickly left, a black shadow stood on the other side of the bushes, looking coldly at the pride in the forest.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail suddenly discovered it and immediately roared angrily as he rushed over.

However, just as he rushed close, the black shadow suddenly crawled into the grass at the side and disappeared.

When Little Curly Tail rushed into the grass, he did not see its figure.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment. Just as he was about to look elsewhere, the ground suddenly collapsed with a bang\!

He did not have the time to react and fell down.
