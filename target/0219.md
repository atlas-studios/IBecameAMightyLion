Chapter 219: Kill All\!

Another day passed.

The wound on the lion king's leg was finally almost healed.

When they continued forward, the pen bird that had left actually flew back and landed in the lion king's thick mane as if nothing had happened.

The mixed fur lion king hesitated for a moment and ignored the little bird.

Although the true leader of this team was not him, under Chu Xiaoye's signal, he was still the temporary leader.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to expose too much of his strength on the snow mountain.

Under the lead of the mixed fur lion king, they passed through the forest and walked to the chaotic stone cliff at the northernmost side of the island.

Along the way, they did not encounter any sea pythons or strange fish again.

They originally thought that the enemy had been killed, but when they came to the edge of this island full of rocks, they realized that almost all the teams were gathered here.

The sea breeze blew and killing intent filled the air.

Here, there were wild dogs, wolves, lions, snake mongrels and honey badgers that specialized in restraining snakes, and some monkey groups that were good at climbing.

At this moment, they were surrounding a dense group of sea pythons and strange fish.

Those sea pythons and strange fish almost covered the entire cliff near the sea. There were at least two to three hundred of them. For some reason, they were all forced here.

In the water at the foot of the cliff, there was also a team on the snow mountain waiting for them.

The mixed fur lion king was extremely excited when it saw this scene. It immediately ran over with the team.

These were all merits.

The lion kings of the other two prides turned their heads and looked at him. They immediately roared.

Clearly, they did not want the pride of the lion king with mixed fur to take their share of merit.

The lion king was not afraid and immediately roared in retaliation, its eyes filled with provocation.

Although he had fewer members than the other party now, his combat strength was something that even he was afraid of\!

His young king and his personal lioness cub were not to be trifled with\!

Have you seen the golden-clawed lion king and the silver-clawed killer?

Do you want to come and see for yourself?

"Roar\!"

The lion king continued to walk forward and let out a tit-for-tat roar.

The two prides had more than ten members each including their lion kings. Among them, a majority was strong male lions. 

At this moment, when they saw that this mixed fur lion king was so arrogant, they were immediately furious. They turned around and roared at him in unison.

To be honest, this formation made the mixed fur lion king a little shocked.

However, when he thought of the backing behind him, his courage immediately increased. He continued forward and continued to roar at the other party.

Since they had seen so many sea pythons and strange fish, how could they leave just like that?

Even the wild dogs and Brother Flat Tops were here. Why could they not stay here?

This group of ocean enemies was the common enemy of grassland animals like them. They had the responsibility and obligation to charge and fight\!

Just as the two prides let out angry roars and were about to rush over to teach them a lesson, a huge snow eagle suddenly flew out of the forest and circled in the sky, letting out a sharp cry.

It was as if he was urging them to kill the enemy quickly.

When the lion kings of the two prides saw this, they could only stop fighting and look at the surrounded sea pythons and strange fish again.

"Roar â€”"

An angry roar\!

One of the tall lions was the first to charge\!

His pride immediately followed behind him and charged bravely into the closest sea python herd.

Then, another pride rushed up.

The battle started\!

The wild dogs, baboons, and snake mongrels all rushed up.

The mixed fur lion king was unwilling to fall behind. It immediately brought its team and rushed up to kill.

His injuries were already healed and his strength had increased greatly. Thinking of the hatred from that night, he was extremely brave and pounced at the giant strange fish\!

These giant strange fish were huge, had thick armor, and sharp fangs. They were much stronger than those sea pythons.

Only pride like them could deal with him.

For example, those small and weak wild dogs and honey badgers could only fight those sea pythons.

The mixed fur lion king roared as it pounced forward and bit the neck of a huge strange fish. Its sharp teeth instantly pierced through its muscles.

Just as the other giant fish were about to rush up, the three lions behind him immediately pounced on them and bit them.

Seeing that the outcome was decided, Chu Xiaoye turned to look at Catherine and Blue, signaling them to maintain a low profile and not expose their true strength too early.

The huge Snow Eagle was still circling overhead.

The three of them lined up and pounced forward to bite with their teeth.

The giant strange fish had long been terrified and panicked. They ran everywhere and no longer had the courage to retaliate.

Some strange fish and sea pythons panicked and jumped down the cliff.

However, there were stronger ocean killers waiting for them in the water at the foot of the cliff.

Rows of white sharks jumped up from the water and opened their mouths to welcome them. Their sharp teeth made a crack and they died completely before they could even touch the sea.

When the army fell, panic would spread.

The remaining sea pythons and giant strange fish no longer had any combat strength and fled in all directions.

However, the more they did this, the more relaxed and crazy the group of killers from the grassland became.

In a moment, corpses were everywhere on this rocky cliff and blood flowed like a river\!

After this group of mutated marine creatures who wanted to leave the sea and invade the grassland were chased to this island by the guardians of the snow mountain to hide, they were finally killed today\!

A few prides gathered and looked at each other disdainfully. Their faces were covered in blood, and they were cold, arrogant, and disdainful.

The other animals also looked at the weaker tribes, looking like they had done the most.

After killing the enemy, they would become enemies.

The battle that had just ended seemed to be starting again.

Other than friendship, there was only war between male lions.

The few lion kings looked at each other and saw the pride and unwillingness in each other's eyes.

They all believed that they were the strongest.

A cry sounded in the sky.

The tense atmosphere immediately relaxed.

The few lion kings tacitly turned their heads and looked elsewhere.

The other animals also retracted their provocative looks.

Now was not the time for internal strife.

The tall white wolf that first appeared walked out of the forest with a group of white foxes.

It was time to reward him.

Furthermore, there were stronger enemies waiting for them.

Their honor and responsibility did not stop here.

The sun shone on the ground and into the sea.

The distant sea was calm.

In the depths of the sea, there were still undercurrents and dark figures.

Everything was just beginning.
