Chapter 26: Battle at Night

Night fell.

A silver moon rose up the branches.

The grassland was not peaceful.

The new home that the cold father's pack moved to was beside the river where all kinds of animals gathered.

Be it day or night, bloody battles always occurred.

The leader of the neighbouring pride, Bill, was patrolling the borders of the territory. He let out low and hoarse roars, as if he was warning the enemies.

The cold father did not dare to stay idle.

After resting in the grass for a while, he patrolled along the border and let out roars that echoed his neighbors' roars.

The roars of the two lions spread far and wide in the dark grassland.

In the distance, the outwardly fierce but inwardly shaky cries of hyena packs rang out.

They seemed to be provoking each other, but they went further and further away from each other.

A wandering lion passed by and did not dare to stop. He left in a hurry.

But.

On the other side of the river, there were a few lion roars, and their auras were not weaker than that of the cold father and Bill.

Furthermore, there seemed to be more than one.

When the cold father and his neighbor, Bill, heard the lion roars, they immediately became nervous. They turned around and returned to the hill.

The two lions were separated by the border and looked at the opposite shore of the river together. Their gazes were cold, vigilant, and even a little flustered. They let out an even more threatening roar.

It was as if they were telling the lions opposite them that they were very strong\! If you dared to attack my territory, I would never back down\!

The few lions on the other side of the river quietened down.

The cold father listened for a while, lowered his head, and looked at the river at the bottom of the hill. He finally relaxed.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the branch of the Baobab tree and watched the scene quietly, feeling a little uneasy.

The river below could indeed stop the few lions on the other side for the time being.

But rivers eventually dry up.

The grass on the grassland had already started to turn yellow.

The wind these few days also carried an obvious heat.

Clearly, the dry season was approaching.

When the dry season arrived and the river water gradually dried up, the few lions opposite could come over easily.

At that time, could his father, this king who was still strong, resist the other party's invasion and challenge?

If they failed, then these five young cubs would be bitten to death by those few strong adult lions.

And their mothers and territories would be occupied by the enemy\!

How terrifying\!

Therefore, he could only continue to work hard, make full use of his time, and make himself stronger\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were already asleep.

After running all the way, with their physiques, they definitely could not handle it.

Chu Xiaoye did not disturb them. He quietly climbed down the tree and entered the bushes at the back.

In addition to training his muscles and strength, he also wanted to train his speed and agility.

Of course, he also had to train his combat skills.

Only in this way could he increase his chances of survival.

The lion, the cold father, heard his movements vigilantly, but he ignored him.

This kid had always been disobedient and dared to disobey him. He did not like him. Even if he went out and was eaten by other carnivores, he would not care.

Chu Xiaoye did not know what he was thinking. He successfully left the camp and crawled into the dense bushes behind.

In the dense bushes, he ran, jumped, dodged, hit and practised all sorts of strange actions.

If it was two cubs, it might not be too strange.

However, he looked a little strange and comical while making a ruckus there alone. It looked like he had gone mad.

"Chi—"

Just as he was concentrating on practising, a strange sound suddenly came from a wilted tree beside him, as if it was mocking him.

Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped and turned to look.

A gray-haired adult baboon was standing on a branch of the withered tree, grinning at him with a mocking expression.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He looked around carefully and did not see any other baboons. He relaxed slightly.

This baboon was about his size, but it looked stronger.

For some reason, it left its troop and came here. Furthermore, it dared to swagger out and mock him.

Does this guy not know that this is the camp of a lion pride?

Chu Xiaoye looked at it and thought of his brothers and sisters who had been killed and eaten by baboons. He also saw how arrogant and provocative it was and anger welled up in his heart\!

"Roar—"

He bared his fangs and roared at the baboon.

The baboon grinned and let out an even more contemptuous laugh. It even broke off a branch and threw it at him with a provocative expression\!

How could he tolerate this?

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly rushed out and jumped onto the withered tree. He bared his fangs and quickly climbed up\!

Since he wanted to practice combat skills, he should engage in actual combat\!

After this baboon left its troop, its strength was greatly reduced\!

He even dared to kill the cruel and cunning hyenas. How could he be afraid of this lone baboon?

The baboon, who was standing on a branch, was frightened by his rapid speed and proficiency in climbing trees. It hurriedly jumped up and fled towards the top of the tree\!

Chu Xiaoye did not stop at all and climbed straight to the top of the tree. His four claws flew as if he was walking on flat ground\!

His speed was even faster than that of a leopard\!

The baboon stood on the highest branch and was stunned. It finally became afraid and immediately bared its teeth. It lowered its head fiercely and let out a sharp and threatening roar at him\!

Chu Xiaoye stopped on a branch that was only half a meter away from it and looked at it coldly and teasingly. There was no fear in his heart\!

His previous battle with the old baboon and hyena had silently established his confidence\!

It was only a baboon\!

He was not afraid\!

"Roar\!"

He let out a provocative roar and continued to climb up\!

The baboon was furious. It raised its sharp claws and ferociously clawed at his face\!

Chu Xiaoye tilted his head and dodged it. With a whoosh, he jumped up and opened his mouth full of sharp teeth\!

He could use his saliva to heal his wounds\!

Therefore, he was not afraid of being injured\!

The baboon was shocked. It did not dare to stay any longer and jumped down from the top of the tree, landing on another small tree beside the tree\!

The small tree swayed violently and was about to break. It seemed to be unable to withstand its weight\!

The baboon hurriedly jumped towards a nearby bush and landed steadily on a branch\!

It raised its head and looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was on the tree. It opened its mouth again and let out an unrestrained laugh.

However, with a buzz, a black swarm of poisonous bees suddenly flew out from the bushes below\!

Those poisonous bees were entirely black and extremely big. The sting on their tails were like sharp daggers. Under the dark moonlight, they flickered with a dark and cold sheen\!

"Buzz…"

Densely packed black poisonous bees instantly flew out of the bushes and charged at it with a murderous aura like a black cloud\!
