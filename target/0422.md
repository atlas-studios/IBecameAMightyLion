Chapter 422: Untitled

In the evening, it rained again.

The rain temporarily covered the blood here and gave the tired pride plenty of time to rest.

Looking at the hyena corpses all over the ground, Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate much. He instructed everyone to use this flesh and blood to fill their stomachs for the time being.

He could not bring back the prey he had gone out to catch previously.

Everyone was already hungry.

Although the hyenas' corpses were especially difficult to swallow, they could at least provide everyone with warmth and energy to support this cold forest.

The scarred cold father had never eaten hyena meat before. Even during the difficult dry season, he had never eaten it. Now, he was wolfing it down and eating exceptionally energetically.

He finally felt good today.

Although he had suffered many injuries and was almost bitten to death, his former bloodthirst and majesty were finally released today after being suppressed by those two unfilial sons for so long.

He was still a lion king that those old enemies did not dare to underestimate\!

The cute violent bear and her son were the least picky about food. Before Chu Xiaoye could give the orders, they started eating.

They had done a great job today. If not for their fierce rolling and disrupting the hyenas' attack formation, the pride of the cold father would have died before Chu Xiaoye and the others could return.

Pit and the other two strong warthogs performed very well.

Chu Xiaoye gave them an appreciative gaze.

Little Mi did not have to say anything. In a battle at this level, it was fine. It only needed to stay alive.

As for Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others, there was no need to mention them.

They had always been the strongest shield in the team, and Chu Xiaoye was grateful to them from the bottom of his heart.

Who else?

Chu Xiaoye looked at the human little girl and the huge black bear beside her.

At this moment, the big black bear was eating the hyena's corpse with relish. From time to time, it would bite a dog's head and hand it to the little girl, letting her eat it. The little girl was so frightened that she waved her hand.

Sensing the young lion king's gaze, the big black bear shrank its neck and continued to bury its head in the dog meat.

Although it was a little timid in the beginning, it would show its might in the future and kill the spotted hyenas until they cried for their parents. It would also make a great contribution if it fled everywhere.

As for the little girl, she naturally did a great job.

Without the little girl's cries and urges, it would not waste its energy.

Chu Xiaoye stared at the familiar pair for a while before walking over. He could not help but size up the strange combination of man and bear again, his eyes filled with bewilderment.

He was sure that he had heard and seen the scene of the little girl commanding the big black bear.

This big black bear had always been timid and lazy. When it saw everyone fighting bitterly, it even retreated and prepared to escape. However, when the little girl shouted those words, this big black bear started to show its strong and fierce nature, and was almost invincible.

Was there really such a coincidence in this world?

Furthermore, this little girl was called Annie and had given the big black bear a name, Tibbs.

Good gracious, this was extraordinary.

Chu Xiaoye stood in front of the pair and was thinking about something.

The big black bear lowered its head to eat, and the little girl was embarrassed by his stare. She lowered her head and said in shame, "Sorry, Annie… Annie is so useless…"

Everyone was fighting and killing many enemies, but she could only sit on the big black bear's back and do nothing.

She did not seem to think that the credit for the big black bear's sudden might was hers.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of her and raised his claws.

At this moment, the big black bear suddenly raised its head and stared at him vigilantly with its two small eyes. There was also a piece of hyena meat that had yet to be torn at the corner of its mouth.

At this moment, it suddenly no longer felt timid or guilty.

It seemed that as long as Chu Xiaoye bullied this human girl, it would immediately fall out and pounce on him.

Chu Xiaoye looked at it with flickering eyes. His claws slowly landed on the little girl's head and he rubbed it a few times, comforting her that she had done well today and did not need to feel guilty.

Even humans mainly relied on intelligence and not strength in battle.

The big black bear was a strength-type, but the little girl commanded it. Without the little girl's command, no matter how powerful the big black bear was, it was useless.

Therefore, the little girl's contributions were not inferior to that of the big black bear.

Chu Xiaoye rubbed the little girl's head and thought about how to ask her about this big black bear being called Tibbs and why she thought of that sentence and could command the big black bear.

The little girl narrowed her eyes and looked very happy from his touch. She said softly, "King, you can understand Annie, right?"

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and did not give any reaction.

If he nodded, he would be in big trouble in the future. This little girl would probably pester him to talk. He would be annoyed to death.

Girls were the most annoying\!

Why? Because they were long-winded.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her calmly and snorted inwardly.

The little girl also frowned and snorted. She pouted and said, "Annie knows that you can understand. You dislike Annie for being useless, so you can't be bothered with her, right?"

Chu Xiaoye retracted his claws and ignored this girl.

The little girl's eyes turned and she suddenly stared at him. "King, Tibbs secretly told me just now that the reason you don't like female cubs is that you only like male cubs and only want to date them, right?"

"Roar\!"

"Bullshit\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately bristled. He roared angrily and stared, slapping the big black bear's head\!

However, after slapping it and looking at the big black bear's confused and wronged expression, he suddenly woke up.

"Hehehehe…"

At this moment, the little girl, who had been looking serious just now, suddenly laughed hysterically and leaned forward and back against the big black bear.

Chu Xiaoye was tricked by this little girl who smelled like milk\!

How could this stupid black bear speak? Why would it tell her these things?

This little girl was very cunning\!

"King, aren't you going to admit it now? You can indeed understand Annie, right? Annie loves you to death\!"

The little girl stopped laughing and pounced over to hug his neck. Her exquisite face was red. She was excited, happy, and excited.

Her golden hair was mixed with the golden mane on Chu Xiaoye's neck. It was difficult to differentiate between them.

The big black bear watched from the side with a dejected expression, his eyes filled with jealousy. He could not even swallow the dog meat in his mouth.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to slap this little fox to the ground, but after thinking about her fragile little body, he could only give up. He swung his head and pushed her away, then aimed his butt at her and let out a big smelly fart.

If you love me, you have to eat farts\!
