Chapter 222: The Choice of the Lionesses

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not face it and dodged to the right.

Wei Li's claws missed and landed where Chu Xiaoye was standing.

She roared angrily and rushed up again.

She was very fast and her pounce was very fierce. Her claws were very sharp\!

However, this time, she still did not touch a trace of this young lion.

Chu Xiaoye nimbly dodged it.

This female cub looked very powerful, but she was also very impatient. Therefore, he decided to anger her first and make her panic before attacking.

He would not expose his true strength so easily.

When the golden claw appeared, one would either die or be injured.

In that case, this matter could not be saved.

Therefore, he decided to treat it calmly.

Wei Li's second slash missed. She was furious and pounced forward again.

This time, Chu Xiaoye could clearly see the anger in her eyes and the ferocity of her actions.

However, he still did not face the attack and continued to dodge.

"Roarâ€”"

Wei Li was really angry. She roared and pounced forward again\!

Chu Xiaoye continued to retreat and looked at her teasingly.

The other white lioness, Alice, stared at him with flickering eyes. She was clearly surprised by his reaction speed and intelligence.

She did not interfere.

Wei Li pounced again.

Chu Xiaoye ran towards the hill at the side, looking like he had nowhere to go.

Wei Li roared and chased after him. Just as she reached the hill, she jumped up and pounced on Chu Xiaoye from behind, pressing him to the ground.

Then, they rolled down the hill and disappeared from Alice and the animals' vision.

Catherine's eyes flickered, but she stood in place and did not move.

Blue smiled and looked cunning.

They naturally knew their king's intentions.

Alice could not see her sister and was anxious. She could not hold back anymore and immediately ran towards the hill.

However, before she could climb up the hill, Wei Li had already reappeared on the hill. Her fur was messy and she staggered, looking flustered.

She lowered her head and vomited crazily on the hill.

Alice was stunned for a moment before she hurriedly climbed up the hill and looked down.

The young lion was lying at the foot of the hill, on the verge of death. He looked like he had been seriously injured by her sister.

However, why was her sister vomiting crazily?

Wei Li lay on the ground and vomited continuously. Her eyes were filled with tears and she was dizzy. For a moment, her mind was blank. She did not know where she was and what she was doing.

Alice stood beside her, not knowing what to do.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye, who was lying on the ground, struggled up and staggered up the hill. He came in front of the sisters, lowered his eyes, and lowered his head to apologize, hoping that they would not take offense and spare his life.

However, just as he came up, Wei Li, who was lying on the ground, hurriedly jumped up. After running a few meters away in fear, she continued to lie down and vomit.

When Alice saw this scene, she was stunned and puzzled.

She had originally wanted to test the strength of this young lion, but now that her sister was vomiting so much that she almost spat out her intestines, she was not in the mood.

She thought that her sister had eaten something bad or had a sudden illness.

She was terrified and hurriedly ran over, preparing to bring her sister home.

Chu Xiaoye took this opportunity to run down the hill and return to the team. He lowered his head and stood respectfully, looking obedient as if he had done nothing.

The white fox looked up at the two female lions and clearly realized that the two female lions were not members of the reward for this mission. She immediately brought the team and continued forward.

Alice looked at them and did not stop them.

Wei Li, who was vomiting, raised her head and looked at the despicable figure in the team. Just as she was about to open her mouth to roar, she vomited again.

Just now, she pounced on the bastard and rolled down the hill. She thought that victory was in her grasp and was about to slap him. In the end, the other party directly spat out black smoke with a puff and stunned her.

Then, the bastard turned around and got up. He slapped her face a few times and sat on her face, spraying the remaining black smoke into her mouth and nose\!

At that moment, she felt like her soul had left her body.

She felt that her body was no longer hers.

It was really smelly\!\!\!

The white fox brought the team out of the valley and saw three white female lions standing on a huge rock in front of them.

Obviously, they were the true givers of the reward.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Catherine, reminding her to keep a low profile and not cause trouble again.

Catherine lowered her head docilely. Her mind could not forget how he had protected her heroically just now.

The team stopped in front of the rock.

The three white female lions looked calmly at the pride.

"Chirp chirp\!"

At this moment, three small pen birds flew out of the manes of the three lion kings and landed in front of the three white female lions. They chattered and cried out non-stop as if they were reporting something.

The three white female lions listened as they sized up the pride below.

The mixed fur lion king lowered its head respectfully and could not help but twist its butt.

The other two lion kings were the same.

After the three pen birds finished reporting, the three white female lions walked down from the rock and came close to the pride. They looked at the three strongest lion kings.

The mixed fur lion king and the other two lion kings were both excited and terrified by their burning gazes. They lowered their bodies slightly to show their respect and obedience.

As expected.

Two of the white female lions walked in front of the two lion kings and brought them away.

The remaining lioness stopped in front of the mixed fur lion king and looked at him with a burning gaze.

Just as the mixed fur lion king was trembling in excitement, this white female lion suddenly passed him and walked into the pride, stopping in front of Chu Xiaoye.

At this moment, all the members of this team were stunned.

The white lioness looked at Chu Xiaoye with a burning gaze. She reached out her head without hesitation and rubbed his forehead. Then, she turned around and gestured for him to follow.

Chu Xiaoye stayed in place and looked at her in a daze.

Beside him, Catherine's muscles were tense, but she lowered her head and remembered his reminder.

At this moment, the mixed fur lion king could not help but turn its head and growl. It looked at the white female lion with a pained expression, as if it was saying, "Honorable Lord, he's still a child\!"

Yes, strictly speaking, Chu Xiaoye had yet to become an adult and was still a child. He had yet to develop completely and did not have any feelings towards relationships.

The mixed fur lion king did not want to snatch the reward from his king. He only knew clearly that his young king had yet to secrete male hormones. If this white female lion chose the king, not only would it waste the reward this time, it would also destroy the king's developing body.

"Lord, please do me a favor and let this child go\!"

The mixed fur lion king's expression looked very sincere and eager.

"Bang\!"

However, what he got in return was a merciless slap from the white lioness.

The lion king with mixed fur's heart trembled and its face was burning with pain. It immediately closed its mouth.

The white lioness turned around and looked sternly at the young lion behind her, signaling him to follow quickly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the lion king with mixed fur, then at Catherine and Blue. Just as he was hesitating, he saw Blue grin at him, signaling him to follow and not be afraid.

As long as this white lioness discovered that he could not mate, she would naturally let him return. There was no need to anger her and fall into a dangerous situation.

Chu Xiaoye thought that it made sense. Anyway, he was still a child. He was useless to this white lioness. So what if he went? Could he, the dignified lion king, be afraid of this woman?

Fine\!

At the thought of this, he immediately followed behind the white female lion and strode away under the strange gazes of the lions.

No lion envied him because he could not get hard at all.

The white lioness brought him over the hill and into the forest.

Stepping on the thick snow, he heard sounds of "creaking" coming from under his feet. For some reason, Chu Xiaoye was a little nervous.

Where were they going?

Suddenly, a cave appeared in front of him.

The white female lion walked straight to the cave and stood at the entrance. She turned her head and gestured for him to come in quickly.

Chu Xiaoye stayed in place, not daring to take another step forward.

He was afraid.

The white female lion stood at the entrance of the cave and turned to look at him with a threatening gaze. She could not help but swing her tail, making her look a little eager.

Chu Xiaoye was even more afraid.

He shook his head and even took a few steps back.

"Roarâ€”"

The white female lion immediately roared angrily, bared her fangs, and looked at him fiercely, telling him to scram over quickly\!

Chu Xiaoye continued to retreat and looked at her pleadingly, indicating that he could not do it. He was still a child, so please let him go.

The white lioness immediately turned around, bared her teeth, and growled, preparing to pounce on him.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and quietly flicked his golden claw.

Right at this moment, there was a sudden noise from the cave.

Then, two tall young lions with gray fur walked out of the hole shakily.

These two lions were almost identical in appearance and the grayish-white fur on their bodies were exactly the same. They were clearly twins.

Their bodies were covered in strange white spots, causing their fur to be covered in bald scars. They looked ugly and miserable.

Although they were tall, their bodies were weak. Their four legs were thin and weak, like four bamboo poles that could break at any time.

They looked haggard and weak, their eyes lifeless, and their breathing heavy. Clearly, they had been tortured by illness for a long time.

When the white lion that was about to flare up saw them, it immediately became gentle and loving. It turned around and stuck out its tongue, tidying the messy fur on their bodies without any disdain.

Obviously, she was their mother.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned in place and quietly retracted his golden claw.

The two brothers who were ill looked at him curiously and vigilantly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the grayish-white fur on their bodies and thought of the grayish-white cub he had seen previously.

If he was not wrong, these lion brothers should be the children born from this white lioness and a lion from the grassland.

Although they were all lions, their genes had long been different. This combination might change the genes of their descendants to strengthen them, but sometimes, it would also bring disaster to their descendants.

The descendants they produced after mating naturally could not compare to the natives here. The immunity in their bodies and their adaptation to the environment here were definitely much weaker.

The illness on this pair of lion brothers had probably appeared on other lions long ago.

Their mother had hidden them in this remote cave. It was very likely that the upper echelons of the snow mountain were afraid that this disease would spread and wanted to get rid of them.

Of course, these were all guesses.

However, this white lioness clearly did not bring him here to make friends with these lion brothers. She had another goal.

It seemed that his actions on that island had already been discovered by the elusive pen bird and reported to this white lioness.

The pen bird was clearly an old friend of hers and had only told her.

Otherwise, she would not have dared to secretly bring him here to see her children.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked at the snow on the ground. Then, he opened his mouth, took a bite, and put it in his mouth.

At this moment, the white female lion turned around and looked at him coldly. She bared her fangs and let out a threatening roar, ordering him to go over.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her calmly and still stood in place.

Since she needed his help, she had to be more polite. This arrogant attitude might be useful to those cowards, but to him, it would only make him more disgusted.

He did not fall for this trick.

"Roarâ€”"

This mother clearly did not know how to respect doctors. She immediately roared angrily and pounced over, preparing to slap him to make him surrender.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not dodge or tolerate it.

"Bang\!"

Before her claws could land, Chu Xiaoye's claws had already slapped her face heavily. She tilted her head and fell into the snow.

The white female lion was stunned.

The lion brothers lying at the entrance immediately let out weak roars. They bared their fangs and were extremely angry, but they could not help.

The white female lion stood up from the ground, her mouth full of snow. She looked at the young male lion in front of her in fear and found it unbelievable.

Even if the two strong lions on the grassland worked together, she could easily defeat them. Now, she was actually slapped down by this lion that had yet to grow fur. How could she not be shocked?

Just as she bared her fangs and was about to pounce on him again, Chu Xiaoye slapped her again and slapped her to the ground.

Before she could get up, Chu Xiaoye had already walked in front of the cave with melted snow in his mouth and stopped in front of the lion brothers.

He did not know if it was useful.

However, he could try.
