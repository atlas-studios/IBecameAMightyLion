Chapter 339: Untitled

The night finally retreated.

When the sun rose, the oasis returned to its former peace and beauty.

Little Curly Tail and the others rested and healed in the forest.

Chu Xiaoye came to the lake and drank the cold water in the lake as he ate the grass by the lake.

Although it was difficult to swallow, he had no choice but to bite the bullet and continue eating.

At noon, he finally felt a faint pain in his stomach and had an urge to go.

Chu Xiaoye found a quiet place and dug a pit. He started to squat nervously.

Fortunately, his body, which the pearl did not miss, quickly excreted.

Chu Xiaoye pierced a branch with his claws and carefully pulled out the pearl with the branch. He rolled on the grass for a while and was about to roll it to the lake to wash it when a snow-white figure jumped out from the grass at the side with a whoosh and snatched the pearl on the ground away.

Then, he jumped onto a big tree at the side.

Tilly stood on the branch and turned to look at him proudly. She even deliberately opened her mouth and bared her teeth, showing him the pearl in her mouth, looking like a victor.

Chu Xiaoye froze in place and looked at her in a daze.

"Roar—Roar—"

Tilly cried out proudly as she sucked on the pearl. She even deliberately twisted her butt provocatively, as if she wanted Chu Xiaoye to chase her.

Chu Xiaoye's expression was stiff. He could not bear to watch. He turned around and walked towards the lake, preparing to wash his claws and drink some water to vomit.

Usually, he was the one who made other lions vomit.

Now, this little white lion almost made him vomit. Furthermore, it used his own things and used his own body. He could not help but admire it.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye came to the lake and stuck his claws into the lake. He rubbed them and created a circle of ripples.

The morning sun shone brightly on the lake.

The green trees by the lake were slanted and clear. They were beautiful.

Chu Xiaoye bathed in the sun and was thinking about something. Tilly quietly came to his side and mimicked him. She extended her golden claws and fiddled in the clear lake water, but she was a little frivolous. She winked at the reflection in the lake and shook her head, as if she was teasing him.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but turn around and look at her.

Tilly immediately turned her head and looked at him too. She grinned and deliberately revealed the pearl in her mouth. She looked at him proudly and continued to wink.

Chu Xiaoye could not bear to see her so arrogant and decided to tell her the truth.

"Roar\!"

He growled, turned around, and walked towards the forest.

Tilly was stunned for a moment before she immediately turned around and followed behind with a puzzled expression.

This was the first time this kid took the initiative to invite her along.

What was he doing in the forest?

Looking at the lush forest with no other members, Tilly was a little nervous and almost spat out the pearl in her mouth.

Hmph, he could not be deceived and let his scheme succeed\!

No matter what happened later, he had to hold this pearl tightly in his mouth and never spit it out\!

Chu Xiaoye brought her to the crude latrine pit. He raised his claws and pointed at the black feces inside. Then, he looked at her mouth.

Tilly walked close and looked into the pit. She immediately vomited and almost vomited. She hurriedly closed her mouth and held the pearl in her mouth tightly.

"Roar —"

She took a few steps back and let out an angry roar.

This bastard really had ill intentions. He wanted to deliberately make her vomit so that she could spit out the pearl in her mouth.

Dream on\!

A look of ridicule appeared in Tilly's eyes. She deliberately opened her mouth and used her tongue to push against the bead, spinning it in her mouth without letting it fall with a provocative expression.

"I won't spit it out\! I'll anger you to death\!"

She was like a childish little girl who had done something wrong but thought that others were envious and jealous of her and were deliberately targeting her. She was stubborn and pleased.

"Ugh —"

She did not vomit, but Chu Xiaoye vomited first.

Chu Xiaoye spat out a few mouthfuls and looked at her as if he was looking at an idiot. He raised his claws and pointed at the feces in the pit. Then, he pointed at the pearl in her mouth.

Afraid that she would not understand, Chu Xiaoye turned around again, raised his tail, and revealed his butt.

Tilly immediately froze in place like a stone sculpture and did not move. She almost stopped breathing, but she still had the pearl in her mouth.

Chu Xiaoye knew that with this little white lion's intelligence, it would definitely understand.

This was definitely a heavy blow to her and she almost broke down.

However, this was not his fault.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her pitifully and walked to the side. He jumped onto the tree and took down the snake tendon on it.

This snake tendon had already been dried and could be worn on the neck. When the wind and rain hit and the sun shone again, it would become even more tenacious after repeated times.

"Whoosh —"

Just as he was biting the snake tendon and preparing to go down, Tilly suddenly turned into a white bolt of lightning and suddenly jumped up, shooting over\!

"Bam\!"

The little white lion pounced on him and pressed him against the branch. It opened its fangs and grabbed his neck. Its claws started to slap his body hard, and it let out an angry and trembling whimper.

Chu Xiaoye saw that she did not hurt too much and did not resist.

In the end, the branch could not withstand the burden and swayed. With a crack, it broke apart.

The two entangled figures fell together.

Fortunately, it was not too high.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye fell into the grass.

Tilly pressed against him again and opened her mouth to bite his face, nose, forehead, and ears with all her might. She whimpered as if she was crying.

Chu Xiaoye closed his eyes and let her bully him. He could not retaliate or bite back.

Anyway, it did not hurt. This little white lion knew its limits.

However, what happened next was too much\!

The little white lion actually bit his mouth and drooled. It stuck out its tongue to lick him and deliberately wanted to return the feces smell in its mouth to him.

This was intolerable\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her and sent her flying.

"Wuwuwuwu…"

Tilly fell into the grass and actually cried like a little girl. Even her tears flowed.

Chu Xiaoye got up and looked at him in shock.

Seeing that she had turned around and was about to pounce on him again, Chu Xiaoye could only immediately pick up the snake tendon from the ground and raise his head unwillingly to show that he would give it to her.

"Stop fooling around. I'll give you a necklace to wear."

Tilly shed tears, bared her teeth, and glared at him. She did not care at all\!

Only an idiot would want this snake tendon\!

She wanted to take revenge and bite this bastard to death\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly raised his claws and told her to calm down.

He immediately bit the snake tendon and walked to the grass at the side. He extended his claws and plucked the pearl from inside. Then, he flicked out a golden claw and started to use the sharp tip of his claws to spin and grind the middle of the pearl.

His golden claws could even penetrate hard rocks and bones of lions, let alone this small pearl.

Soon, he drilled a small hole in the middle of this pearl, just enough for the tendon in his mouth to pass through.

He originally wanted to give this gift to Catherine or Mei Mei, or Little Curly Tail so he could use it as a token of love for Molly. However, it seemed that he should not disgust them.

The gifts that were excreted from the back would make him feel nauseous every time he saw them. He really could not give them away, so he could only give them to this female cub.

Anyway, she liked it.

Tilly did not know what he was doing. When she came close, she still bared her fangs and had an angry and fierce expression, indicating that she wanted to bite him to death. She wanted him to lie down and die obediently\!

Chu Xiaoye used the tip of his claw and used all his strength to penetrate the snake tendon.

Tilly lay at the side and watched this scene, puzzled and puzzled. She did not know what it meant to do this.

Just as she was impatient from waiting, bared her fangs, and was about to flare up again, Chu Xiaoye immediately bit this pearl necklace and went to her side. He used all his strength to help her wear it on her neck and tied it crudely into a dead knot.

Then, Chu Xiaoye retreated and looked at her.

At this moment, Tilly lowered her head and looked at the pearl hanging on her neck. She widened her eyes and was as stunned as a stone sculpture. She did not move, and the anger and ferocity on her face had long disappeared.

The sun was bright and the breeze was gentle.

At this moment, this noble little princess who had come from the snow mountain was completely confused.
