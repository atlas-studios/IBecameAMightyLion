Chapter 133: The Hyenas’ Siege

However.

This kick did not hurt or itch for Little Xiang. It did not have any deterrence.

It still used its nose to push Chu Xiaoye's butt.

"Pfft—"

Chu Xiaoye could only do as he wished and let out a loud fart\!

At this moment, the hyenas had already pounced\!

Under the cover of the black smoke, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up. His body flashed and he bit the neck of a hyena, pressing it to the ground\!

The other hyenas immediately stopped in their tracks in fright when they saw this scene. As they retreated, they cried out, as if they were cheering for themselves and their companions.

As for the hyena leader with its face covered in blood, it cried out even more angrily, as if it was urging them to continue attacking\!

However, under the deterrence of Chu Xiaoye's sudden attack and a fatal blow, the hyenas hesitated.

They were afraid.

Chu Xiaoye bit the hyena's throat in one bite, then picked it up and raised his head, looking coldly at this group of enemies.

His hind legs were actually trembling.

He had yet to recover his strength and the medicinal effect in his body had yet to be completely eliminated. The release of strength just now made his limbs go limp and he almost fell to the ground.

However, at this moment, he could not show weakness.

Otherwise, this group of ferocious enemies would swarm him and tear him into pieces.

At this moment.

The little elephant standing behind him did not look worried about its fate at all. Instead, it stuck out its nose and narrowed its eyes, sniffing the smelly fart he had just released with all its might, looking very infatuated.

Chu Xiaoye did not know whether to laugh or cry.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Under the cry of the hyena leader, the hyenas finally dispersed.

However, they did not retreat. Instead, they split up and surrounded the place tightly.

They had plenty of patience\!

Hyenas had much more endurance than lions.

They could surround the enemy for a few days with the strength of a group and harass them continuously with turns until the enemy was exhausted.

They were not worried that the cheetah would escape.

The cheetah was already seriously injured and had two young cubs as a burden. It could not escape at all.

Therefore, they placed all their strength and attention here.

This small elephant was their main goal.

The dozen or so members could only eat their fill by relying on the size of this small elephant.

They were scattered not far away, standing or lying down. Their dark eyes were fixed on the elephant and lion under the tree.

A few minutes later, under the cry of the hyena leader, three hyenas ran over and started to circle the elephant and lion. As they cried out, they made sprinting movements and deliberately frightened them, wanting to expend their energy.

However, this elephant and lion actually ignored them.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the ground with his ears pricked up and his eyes closed to rest, looking calm.

He had long experienced the moves of these hyenas. They were cunning, timid and paranoid. Every member had the intention of having other companions attack first, but none of them dared to attack first.

Especially after he had just threatened the hyena with a fatal move, these fellows did not dare to charge forward and attack.

He only cared about lying down and recovering his strength.

The little elephant beside him also did not have any fear. He did not know if it did not understand how terrifying these hyenas were or if it was born stupid.

This fellow seemed to be especially interested in his farts. At this critical moment, he was actually still using his nose to push against his butt, wanting him to continue farting.

What a wonder\!

Chu Xiaoye was hungry and thirsty. He really wanted to turn his head and bite its nose. He wanted to suck some blood and eat some meat to replenish his energy.

However, he could not bite.

Black smoke was still coming out of this bastard's nostrils. He had clearly sucked in his fart and stored it in his long nose, constantly reminiscing.

This made him speechless\!

He closed his eyes and ignored it as much as possible, lest he wasted his brain power and energy.

The three clown-like hyenas performed for a long time, but there was no response. They could only leave while panting.

Three more hyenas walked over and continued to perform.

Chu Xiaoye occasionally opened his eyes and looked at them coldly, indicating that he was not asleep. "Go on."

If you dare to pounce on me, I'll send you to the afterlife with a crack\!

However, none of them were bold.

They would rather continue to wait and continue to surround him than take the risk of being bitten to death.

They had time, patience, and stamina.

However, they seemed to have underestimated the enemy in front of them.

Most enemies would become more and more tired and weak after being surrounded by them. They would also reveal more and more flaws, and in the end, they would be torn to pieces and devoured.

The enemy in front of them was the opposite.

What he needed was time.

The night quietly passed.

The confrontation of old enemies, the thirst for food, and the mother's determination continued silently on this night.

The cheetah mother lay on the ground, her abdomen heaving violently. The blood on her wound had already coagulated.

Two little cheetahs were lying in her arms, licking her wounds.

Her wounds might be healed with her tenacious life force, but the hunger in her stomach would take her life.

She would not be able to hunt for a week or even two weeks.

She no longer relied on speed the most.

She would starve to death, and her two children would starve to death. Or, they would be torn to pieces by the ferocious killers waiting around.

Her eyes were open, and her gaze was blank. She was quiet and calm, as if she had already accepted this cruel reality.

On the distant grassland, the darkness gradually receded.

A ray of light bloomed from the distant horizon like a beautiful flower and bloomed in her amber eyes, becoming brighter and more beautiful.

She looked on obsessively, not daring to close her eyes.

The hyenas not far away also turned their heads and looked at the light.

Dawn finally arrived.

They would continue to fight tirelessly and drain the enemy.

They believed that on the morning of the second sun, they would eat a sumptuous meal until their stomachs turned round and they felt like vomiting\!

Wishes were always beautiful.

At this moment.

The cub that had been lying on the ground, who they did not know if it was pretending to sleep or if it was really sleeping, finally raised its head, opened its eyes, and stood up.

He stretched and twisted his body. Then, he looked at the morning sun in the distance.

Was he reminiscing about the life of the pride and sighing about the miserable fate he was about to face?

Of course not.

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly shot towards the hyena leader like an arrow\!

He was only thinking if he should make an exception and eat sour and smelly dog meat today.

He was hungry.
