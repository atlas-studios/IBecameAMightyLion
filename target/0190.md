Chapter 190: Little Curly Tail's Domination

Under the sun.

Little Curly Tail's brown fur was soft and full of luster.

His once weak body was now tall and strong, catching up to his father.

The most eye-catching thing about him was the thin and curled tail behind him.

When he ran out of the camp excitedly and came in front of the two wandering lions, the provocative roars of the two wandering lions immediately stopped.

They had previously seen the lion king here at the borders of this territory.

It was a tall and mighty male lion with a lush mane.

They had come here today to challenge the strong lion king, then occupy this territory and the female lions here.

However, why was a young lion that had yet to grow a mane running out?

Where was the strong lion king?

Just as they were feeling puzzled, the kid who came in front of them immediately bared his fangs and started provoking them impatiently, looking eager to fight.

This puzzled them even more.

"Roar—"

However, they would not allow this smelly brat to be arrogant in front of them\!\!

Since he wanted to overestimate his capabilities and court death, they would fulfill his wish\!

Kill him and then kill his father\!

The two lions immediately roared angrily and pounced forward mercilessly.

Little Curly Tail arched his body, his eyes bright with excitement. His curled tail could not help but sway gently.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly jumped up and jumped over the heads of the two wandering lions like his brother used to fight those hyenas\!

At the same time, the curled tail behind him suddenly straightened and instantly wrapped around the neck of a wandering lion with a whoosh\!

When he jumped over and landed behind them, the upper body of this wandering lion that was wrapped around its neck was raised up by the pull. Then, with a bang, it fell to the ground\!

Before he could stand up again, Little Curly Tail had already turned around and pounced on him, scratching his face\!

Another wandering lion hurriedly turned around and roared as it pounced at him.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail swung his tail and slapped him hard in the face. As if it was full of thorns, he tore off a piece of flesh on his face\!

The two wandering lions immediately let out a scream and became even crazier.

Little Curly Tail jumped back agilely and looked at them excitedly. His tail swayed gently behind him, as if he was urging them to continue.

The two wandering lions' faces were covered in blood. They immediately roared angrily and rushed up\!

Little Curly Tail put away the claws on his feet and stood in place, waiting for them with a burning gaze.

When they bared their fangs and pounced close, Little Curly Tail suddenly raised his upper body and swung his two claws, slapping the faces of the two wandering lions heavily\!

"Bang\!"

The two wandering lions tilted their heads and fell to the ground.

This scene was like the scene when Chu Xiaoye fought.

Little Curly Tail did not chase after them. Instead, he stood in place and roared, as if he was saying, "Get up\! Continue\!"

He was a little disappointed.

These two seemingly strong wandering lions seemed to be inferior to his father. They were really boring.

At this moment, the two wandering lions knew that they were no match for this young lion\!

They immediately lay on the ground, showing their abdomen. They looked at this young lion with abnormal strength in fear, indicating that they admitted defeat.

Usually, at this time, the victor would be pleased with himself and walk around them before letting them go. He would not kill them.

However, they clearly did not realize the severity of the problem.

They admitted defeat so quickly that Little Curly Tail, who had just started fighting, was very angry.

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and pounced forward. He grabbed the butt of a wandering lion and his sharp claws pierced into its muscles\!

"Chi\!"

Blood sprayed and flesh splashed\!

Half of the wandering lion's butt was actually torn off\!

Before he could scream, Little Curly Tail swung his tail and wrapped it around his neck with a whoosh. Then, he dragged him and started running quickly\!

The wandering lion widened its eyes and opened its mouth. Blood sprayed from its back. Its nearly 300-kilogram body was dragged until it was almost flying on the grass\!

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail ran vigorously on the grassland while roaring excitedly. He was as happy as a gust of wind.

Aisha brought the female lions and stood not far away, looking blankly.

The cold father hid behind them, his mouth twitching violently. There was a striking scratch on his forehead.

Last time, when a strong wandering lion invaded the territory, he immediately ran out to prepare for battle. In the end, this unfilial son ignored the rules and actually exceeded his authority to do things for him\!

He naturally could not tolerate it. He slapped him, wanting to slap this unfilial son to the ground. In the end, he was the first to be slapped down and his forehead was scratched by that unfilial son\!

At that time, he was furious and prepared to jump up and teach this unfilial son a lesson. In the end, his unfilial son ignored him and charged straight at the invading wandering lion. With a slap, he actually sent the wandering lion that was even stronger than him flying and it fainted on the spot\!

Then, he turned around. As he peed, he quietly went to mark the territory.

Now, the cold father was extremely angry to see this unfilial son tyrannically exercising his authority as king and being so cruel and merciless. Little Curly Tail completely ignored the rules.

He decided to teach this unfilial son's-- mother a lesson\!

He was full of anger as he walked to Aisha's side. He bared his fangs and raised his claws. Under the unfilial son's gaze, he gently helped Aisha remove the grass on her body.

Little Curly Tail dragged the unconscious wandering lion and ran over.

As for the other wandering lion, it had long peed its pants in fear and fled in panic.

When the cold father saw his unfilial son charging over with a murderous aura, he immediately roared angrily, turned around, and ran towards the distant border.

It had been raining non-stop recently and the smell at the border had long been washed away. He had to continue working.

He was a king who loved his work\!

Little Curly Tail came in front of his mother and looked coldly at his back. He let go of his tail and walked proudly in front of his mother and the other lionesses, as if he was waiting for praise.

Mei Mei walked over sleepily from behind and curled her lips at his pleased appearance. Her blue eyes revealed human-like disdain.

She seemed to be saying, "Don't be smug\! You're far inferior to brother\!"

Little Curly Tail looked at her and ignored her. Instead, he raised his head and looked at the distant grassland.

He knew that Catherine had gone to find his brother.

He and Mei Mei could not leave for the time being.

There were still brothers and sisters to take care of in the pride.

He would definitely protect his mother, his brothers and sisters, and this home, waiting for his brother to return.

He believed that his brother would definitely return.

He would.
