Chapter 244: Mutated Rabbit

"Buzz —"

Chu Xiaoye's mind buzzed.

For some reason, he suddenly thought of the red-eyed animal he had encountered in the village where humans lived when he followed them to hunt in the pride of the cold father.

The animal was extremely strong and its eyes were also blood red. It looked extremely strange.

"Whoosh—"

Just as Chu Xiaoye was staring blankly at the blood-eyed snow rabbit, Tilly, who was beside him, suddenly rushed down\!

The little white lion was very fast.

However, when she rushed under the tree, the snow rabbit with bloodshot eyes had already fled. It jumped into the snow forest and disappeared.

Tilly stood under the tree in a daze, clearly stunned by this extraordinary snow rabbit.

Not only did this snow rabbit kill its own kind and eat the corpses of its own kind, it was also extremely vigilant and fast. Ordinary snow rabbits could not compare to it.

Even if it was mutated, it was very suspicious.

Tilly clearly wanted to continue chasing, but she realized that the snow on the ground was too deep and it was inconvenient to walk.

She looked up at the tree and realized that Chu Xiaoye was also looking at her with a strange gaze.

"Roar\!"

Tilly immediately started drooling again and pretended to be stupid with her stomach rumbling with hunger.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and rode on her. He raised his claws and started whipping her head from left to right.

After slapping him dozens of times, the little white lion suddenly roared angrily. It turned around and sent him flying. Then, it bared its fangs and stared at him with flames shooting out of its eyes. It even flicked its golden claws.

Look\!

He finally could not help but give himself away\!

She was definitely going to be the Oscar Best Actress this year\!

It was bad enough that he was pretending to be stupid, but the child who was pretending to drink milk really refreshed his worldview.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her mockingly and raised his golden claws.

Do you still want to continue fighting?

Then come. He was not afraid.

Tilly glared at him angrily and panted heavily for a while. Then, she turned her head and looked elsewhere, looking like she hated him and did not want to see him again.

At this moment, Catherine dragged a huge snow deer and walked over with difficulty while stepping on the snow.

Chu Xiaoye ignored the little white lion and immediately went over to take the snow deer and eat it.

Catherine quietly retreated to the side.

Tilly immediately ran over and ate without hesitation.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her with a disdainful expression, then looked up at Catherine, signaling her to come and eat.

Catherine lowered her head and still refused.

In front of him, she had always treated herself as a servant and paid attention to her status.

Chu Xiaoye knew how stubborn this female cub was. He stopped in front of her and lowered his head to tear off one of the snow deer's legs. He walked over and placed it in front of Catherine, then returned and continued to eat.

Catherine looked at the food on the ground with sparkling eyes and a warm heart.

Back then, he had used this food to silently save her life and let her survive.

She raised her head and looked at him, then at the little white lion beside him. Then, she slowly lowered her head and bit the food.

They were indeed compatible.

The entire snow deer was quickly eaten.

Chu Xiaoye was only half full. Just as he was about to find more prey, the roar of a mixed fur lion king suddenly came from the snow forest not far away.

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed over with Catherine and Tilly.

For some reason, the snow rabbit with bloodshot eyes just now had been lingering in his mind and could not be forgotten.

When they rushed to the snow forest, they realized that the mixed fur lion king and his subordinates were surrounded by a large group of strong white bears.

The female lion, Lina, was baring her fangs and guarding in front of a wild boar.

They had caught this prey. Just as they were about to eat, this group of white bears rushed out of the forest to snatch their prey.

They naturally did not dare to give it up.

However, in this forest covered in thick snow, they could not use their full strength to fight this group of white bears.

The other party had a total of ten, and their numbers were twice theirs.

However, when Chu Xiaoye arrived with Catherine and Tilly, the mixed fur lion king immediately relaxed. Its courage increased and it roared even louder and louder.

At this moment, the Jerry brothers also heard the roar and rushed over.

Blue, the male leopard, jumped over from the tree.

The ten white bears took advantage of their territory and were not afraid. They still roared angrily and charged over with a murderous aura.

All the team members looked at their young king, as if they were waiting for his orders.

Chu Xiaoye was immediately in high spirits. Just as he was about to roar, Tilly, who was beside him, suddenly let out a roar and rushed up first.

The mixed fur lion king was stunned for a moment before it immediately rushed up.

The three lions behind him immediately followed closely.

When the other team members saw this, they no longer hesitated and roared as they rushed out\!

No one was willing to show their timidity\!

Chu Xiaoye stood in place in a daze, the corner of his mouth twitching. He turned around and saw that only Catherine was standing silently behind him, accompanying him.

"Roar—"

Since his subordinates had already rushed up first, how could he, the king, stand here motionless?

He roared angrily and rushed up with Catherine.

However, the team members were too strong and did not give them any chance to show their strength.

In the blink of an eye, the ten strong white bears were beaten to the ground. Some died on the spot, some were seriously injured, and some fell to the ground in fear.

Tilly did not use her golden claws and only used her two feet to slap them away.

The Jerry brothers were equally fierce.

This might be their first battle.

In order to show their value in front of Chu Xiaoye, the two brothers were extremely brave. They bit through the heads of the white bears one by one.

As for the mixed fur lion king, it was experienced in combat. With a swipe of its claws, these white bears would be dizzy. Then, he specifically wanted the other party's spine and bit these white bears until they fell to the ground.

As for the male leopard, Blue, he was eating fresh prey on the tree and did not come down to fight.

This sort of autumn wind swept away the fallen leaves and there was no suspense in the battle. He did not want to waste time and energy.

Look at the young king shouting so loudly behind. In the end, he did not even touch the enemy's fur and they were completely wiped out.

It was really awkward.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the group of white bears lying on the ground. In order to avoid embarrassment, he could only walk in front of the corpse of a white bear and extend his claws to touch its tail fur.

The battle ended.

Tilly raised her head and stood on the hill with a cold and arrogant expression. She looked down at them like a victorious general who was preparing to accept the worship of the soldiers.

However, no one bothered with her.

The mixed fur lion king brought the pride in front of Chu Xiaoye and Catherine and respectfully asked him if the corpses of these white bears could be eaten.

That wild boar was definitely not enough for them to eat.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the white bears and gestured for them to eat as much as they wanted.

Perhaps the taste was not good, but to animals, being able to fill their stomachs was the most important.

The mixed fur lion king immediately brought the pride and started eating.

The Jerry brothers dragged a white bear in front of Chu Xiaoye and respectfully gestured for him to eat first.

These two huge adult lions stood in front of Chu Xiaoye. They were much larger than him, but at this moment, they were like two children being filial to their elders.

Chu Xiaoye grinned, indicating that he was already full.

He was not interested in the corpses of these white bears.

The Jerry brothers immediately lay down and ate.

The female lion, Lina, dragged the wild boar over and placed it in front of Chu Xiaoye and Catherine. Then, she left to eat the white bears herself.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and thought to himself, girls are more considerate.

Catherine walked forward and used her claws to tear open the thick fur on the wild boar. Then, she retreated to the side.

Chu Xiaoye did not stand on ceremony with her anymore. He immediately walked over and started eating.

Tilly stood alone on the hill, alone and filled with anger.

She had killed the most enemies and made the most contributions, but she did not receive any praise or reward. She did not even receive any admiration or respect. All the benefits were taken by that fellow. How could she not be angry?

"Roar—"

She immediately roared angrily, wanting to remind everyone of her existence.

However, after everyone looked at her, they took the initiative to ignore her again.

Previously, she had always pretended to be a fool. Now, no matter how she behaved, everyone took the initiative to treat her as a fool.

When Tilly saw this scene, she was so angry that she almost fainted.

She immediately ran over from the hill and came in front of Chu Xiaoye. She fought with him for the wild boar meat. As she ate, she squeezed him hard to show that she was the boss of this team.

Chu Xiaoye tore off two pig legs, gave one to Catherine, and ate the other himself, ignoring her.

Chu Xiaoye had seen many girls with this personality. As long as you ignored her and let her make a fuss, she would be boring herself soon.

The more you bothered with her, the more excited she became and the more happy she became.

Indeed, after a while, Tilly lost her appetite and walked over to snatch his pig leg to eat.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not stand on ceremony with her. He flicked his golden claw and looked at her coldly.

As long as she dared to be impudent again, he would slap her without hesitation.

The dignity of a lion king could not be challenged\!

Especially in front of so many subordinates.

Beside her, Catherine also bared her claws and stared at her coldly.

Seeing that he was really angry, Tilly did not dare to continue provoking him. She looked at him resentfully and could only turn around and leave angrily.

In the snow forest not far away, the red-eyed rabbit lay on a big tree covered in snow and looked at them coldly.

Its snow-white fur almost merged with the tree trunk.

Those sharp claws pierced firmly into the tree trunk and grabbed it steadily.
