Chapter 397: Father and Son

The cold father was wrong.

He thought that he was helping his tribe reproduce. He thought that he was doing something natural. No one was qualified to stop him.

Therefore, he behaved exceptionally arrogant and impudent.

However, he had provoked the wrong person.

If it were Little Curly Tail and the others, no one would care about him because of this.

Everyone felt that it was extremely normal.

However, to Chu Xiaoye, who still had a little shame, this could not be tolerated.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye rushed over and slapped the cold father on the head, slapping him off Maya's back. He crossed his legs and fell to the ground in a sorry state.

Maya, who was lying on the ground, hurriedly stood up and ran to the grass at the side to hide.

No one knew if they were frightened or if they felt a little embarrassed in front of their children and so many companions.

The cold father roared angrily and jumped up from the ground. He glared at his unfilial son in front of him. His face was burning with pain and a certain place was also hurting from the sudden pull.

"Unfilial son\! I worked hard, worked hard for the strength and prosperity of my tribe, and contributed to the future of the pride and tomorrow. What's wrong with that? What right do you have to hit me? Give me a reason\!"

At this moment, the cold father was probably roaring in his heart.

Chu Xiaoye did not give him any reason. He took a step forward and slapped him again, telling him to scram.

The cold father was furious. He suddenly roared angrily, bared his fangs, and widened his eyes, glaring\!

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and raised his claws again.

The cold father turned around and left. As he walked towards the distant forest, he turned around and let out a hoarse and angry roar. Tears flowed from his eyes and he looked very wronged.

He wanted to run away from home and never return\!

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and turned around to look at the little girl and the two young cubs. He thought for a moment and rubbed Qiqi and Nunu's heads with his claws, explaining, "They were playing games just now."

This was clearly unnecessary. It was only to hide the embarrassment in his heart.

Unexpectedly, when Nunu heard this, he immediately rode on Qiqi's back. He grinned and narrowed his eyes, mimicking his father's appearance and actions just now, indicating that he and Qiqi also wanted to play games.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him down from Qiqi's back. The muscles at the corner of his mouth twitched non-stop.

Old gangster, you have done a lot of harm.

"You're not allowed to play such games again\!"

Chu Xiaoye warned the two little fellows with a stern gaze. At the same time, he looked at Pit, who revealed its head from the hole, and told him to supervise them.

Pit hurriedly nodded.

Chu Xiaoye had a headache and could not be bothered with these things. He walked in front of the prey and instructed everyone to start eating.

Catherine looked at him with flickering eyes and then at Maya, who was walking over. She lowered her head and quietly walked to the side to eat her prey.

Molly and Mei Mei ate their prey together and would look up at Little Curly Tail from time to time. They thought of how the two of them had played this game a few times during those nights.

Of course, Little Curly Tail was only bullying her by pressing on her body.

Little Chino, who had lost his tail, finally recovered. After being stimulated by the cold father, he was fawning on the Jiela sisters with Big Chino and specially bit meat for them with his sharp teeth.

The brave and fierce sisters, covered in scars, looked down on these two cowards and did not even look at them.

The six sisters secretly looked at Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye was the king of the pride, so he had to take on some missions.

In their eyes, this young king was perfect.

He was strong, young, handsome, smart, and benevolent. He treated them very well, unlike those lion kings in other prides who were selfish and cold. They only knew how to bully female lions and did not let them eat together.

Therefore, they were willing, even eager, to let their descendants inherit his genes.

Although everyone was eating with their heads lowered, they seemed to be thinking about something. What the cold father had done just now was too brazen and exciting.

They were really stimulated.

The atmosphere was very strange.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw many burning gazes. He could not help but scold that old pervert again.

What was the situation now? They were still escaping. They did not even have a territory that belonged to them. They did not even have the most basic safety. How could they reproduce?

He was creating trouble\!

Chu Xiaoye stood up and looked up. Seeing that everyone was eating with relish and that the old hooligan still had not returned, he immediately thought to himself, Could he have really run away from home?

Normally, that fellow should not have the courage.

The little girl squatting beside him poked his body with her finger and said softly, "King, your father ran away from home. It's so dark outside. Will he be eaten by the big tiger?"

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He immediately got up, turned around, and ran away.

Catherine did not hesitate and immediately followed behind him.

Chu Xiaoye heard the noise and looked back. He happened to see the little lioness's dark and bright eyes flickering with a moving luster under the night sky as she looked at him in a daze.

Seeing him look over, Catherine hurriedly lowered her head.

"Roarâ€”"

Right at this moment, the cold father's roar suddenly came from the forest not far away.

Chu Xiaoye's heart sank. With a whoosh, he rushed over like lightning and passed through the forest in the blink of an eye, arriving at the place where the cold father roared.

The scene in front of him immediately shocked him\!

A huge python fell from the tree. Its thick upper body was wrapped tightly around the cold father and it slowly dragged him towards the tree\!

The cold father could not struggle anymore. He could only widen his terrified eyes and let out weak cries.

When he saw Chu Xiaoye, his terrified eyes immediately bloomed with joy. He let out a hoarse roar and his eyes were filled with tears, as if he was saying, "Son\! Save me\! My dear son, you're finally here\!"

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and swung his golden claw. A golden light flashed in front of the cold father, like a meteor crossing the night sky\!

"Bang\!"

The cold father fell to the ground and blood sprayed on his head\!

The huge python's body was cut off by Chu Xiaoye's claws. Its upper body fell to the ground and was still wrapped around the cold father. Its lower body was still wrapped around the tree trunk on it. As it sprayed blood, it twisted in pain.

The upper body of the python lost its strength. As it twisted and struggled, it let go of the cold father. Its ferocious head suddenly jumped towards Chu Xiaoye. It opened its bloody mouth, wanting to use its last bit of strength to take revenge\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye waved his claws and slapped it away\!

The cold father jumped up from the ground with his head full of blood and ran over in fear. He hid behind Chu Xiaoye, widened his eyes, and trembled, looking terrified.
