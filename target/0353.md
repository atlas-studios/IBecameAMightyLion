Chapter 353: Untitled

King Kong?

Chu Xiaoye suppressed the excitement in his heart, widened his eyes, and held his breath. He stared fixedly there and did not move.

Finally, a figure walked out.

He was actually a savage\!

This savage had messy hair and a dirty face. He was tall and strong, and his size was almost the same as that of a chimpanzee. His walking posture was also similar to that of a chimpanzee. His face was very long, his nose was short and his mouth was protruding. His appearance was also quite similar to that of a chimpanzee\!

However, his feet were terrifyingly big and were a meter long. When he walked, they made banging sounds.

Chu Xiaoye looked at this savage in shock and could not help but think to himself, Could it be that this strong savage had just evolved from a chimpanzee?

The black gorilla kneeling on the ground raised the little girl and moved forward while kneeling. It stopped in front of the savage and respectfully raised the little girl higher, letting out a strange cry.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and was ready to attack.

Just as he thought that the savage was about to eat the little girl in one bite, he saw the savage suddenly take out a fresh flower from behind. He knelt on one knee and handed it to the little girl. His gaze was gentle and he was saying strange words.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned and tongue-tied.

Was this savage looking for a mate?

The gorilla kneeling on the ground straightened the little girl on its head and let her feet step on its head, supporting her with both hands.

The little girl widened her eyes and looked at the human-like but not human animal in front of her in fear and disbelief. She was at a loss.

She turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye pitifully.

The savage suddenly let out a roar. His eyes widened as he looked angrily at Chu Xiaoye, his face fierce as if he was threatening him.

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps forward and ignored his threat. Instead, he looked at the little girl standing on the black gorilla's head, wanting to see her current thoughts.

After all, his current form was only that of a wild beast and a lion. He was too inferior to humans.

As for this savage, be it his appearance, actions, or thoughts, he was rather similar to humans.

For example, such a romantic act of kneeling on one knee and giving flowers was not something a lion could do.

Therefore, he wanted to see if the little girl was willing to stay.

From the current situation, this savage liked her very much and would definitely not hurt her. And if he followed their pride to the grassland over there, he could not guarantee that he could always protect her.

"King, save me\!"

It seemed that the little girl was unwilling to be with this savage. She held back her tears and asked for his help.

The savage seemed to be angered by the little girl's attitude. He suddenly stood up, extended his claws, and grabbed the little girl's golden hair. His face was distorted and he let out an angry roar.

Perhaps, he was confident that this human little girl should like him and stay with him happily, not continue to stay with this lion on all fours.

How could humans mix with lions\!

The savage grabbed the little girl's hair and roared, revealing his mouth full of fangs. He looked even more terrifying than an angry chimpanzee.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye no longer hesitated and pounced over.

Such a rough animal was not worthy of having such a beautiful and exquisite little girl. If he really left the little girl here, she would probably die even more miserably.

It seemed that this bastard's gentleness just now was fake\!

The golden claw slashed down and went for the savage's head\!

The savage reacted extremely quickly and immediately jumped away to dodge the golden claw. Then, he suddenly threw a punch at him and let out a deafening roar\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye was sent flying by his punch and landed heavily on the ground.

It was not that he could not dodge in time, but the roar suddenly made his ears buzz and his mind blank. Even his vision swayed, so his reaction was half a beat slower.

"Roar —"

The chimpanzees around him seemed to have received an order and immediately roared and pounced at him.

Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped up from the ground, shook his head, and flicked his golden claws, preparing to start a massacre.

Right at this moment, the little girl who was stepping on the gorilla's head suddenly let out a sharp cry and stared at the savage with a reprimanding and angry expression.

"Despicable person\! Bullying with numbers\! If you have the ability, fight alone\! If you win against the king, I'll stay\!"

Although she spoke in English, for some reason, Chu Xiaoye could understand her instantly.

The savage clearly understood.

Just as the surrounding chimpanzees were about to pounce on Chu Xiaoye and tear him apart, the savages suddenly raised their arms and roared, stopping them.

The chimpanzees immediately stopped, but they still stared fiercely at Chu Xiaoye.

The savage raised the red flower and handed it to the little girl. He opened his mouth and smiled ferociously, saying something again.

The general meaning was: "Honorable and beautiful lady, is what you said true? As long as I defeat this lion, will you stay and be my partner?"

The little girl's face was pale and her body was trembling slightly. She was clearly extremely afraid, but she pretended to be calm. She did not extend her hand to take the flowers that he had brought over. Instead, she nodded and said, "Yes. Only by fighting alone will you be a hero. I only like heroes."

In the little girl's heart, Chu Xiaoye was very strong. He could slap a big tree to the ground with one claw. He would definitely be able to slap this savage to death very easily.

"Hehehehehe…"

The savage suddenly let out a strange laugh and looked very pleased.

He opened his mouth, bent down, and stuck the flower in his hand into the little girl's hair roughly. Then, he straightened up and looked at Chu Xiaoye, his eyes revealing a ferocious smile and disdain.

"Roar —"

He suddenly beat his chest and roared. He raised his head and stuck out his chest with a provocative expression.

The chimpanzees surrounding them immediately retreated a large distance when they received the order, making the space in the middle more spacious.

At this moment, the two black gorillas standing not far behind Chu Xiaoye suddenly spat out blood and fell to the ground\!

Tilly and Catherine finally caught up and came behind him.

The other gorillas roared angrily and bared their fangs, looking murderous.

The savage raised his hand and stopped them. Then, he raised his huge feet and took a few steps forward. Then, he extended his fist and shook it provocatively at Chu Xiaoye.

"Do you dare to fight?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the strong chimpanzees around him. If they attacked together, even if the three of them won in this complicated terrain, they might be injured. If they fell off the cliff, there would be no hope.

Saving this human little girl was his own business. He could not put Tilly and Catherine in danger for a human.

This was not worth it or fair.

Therefore, he decided to accept this savage's challenge.

He turned around and looked at Tilly and Catherine behind him. He told them to watch from the spot and not help.

However, he also knew that these two female lions would not listen to him.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and took the lead to attack. His figure flashed and he pounced at the savage in front of him, slapping him.

The savage grinned and raised his head, standing in place. He was clearly disdainful. He clenched his fist and attacked\!

"Bang\!"

The claws and fists collided heavily\!

The savage stood in place and did not move.

Chu Xiaoye fell from the sky and did not stop at all. He pounced forward again.

This time, he flicked his golden claw.

The savage seemed to know how powerful his golden claws were. Before he could approach, he suddenly jumped over and smashed his head with a bang.

His movements were fierce and violent\!

Chu Xiaoye did not take it head-on. He immediately put away his claws and dodged.

From the structure of their bodies, even if Chu Xiaoye's strength was not inferior to that of this savage, the strength he could use his claws to hit was definitely not as heavy as the other party's fists.

If he took it head-on, his claws would have just pierced through the other party's fur when the other party's iron ball-like fist would have already smashed onto his body.

At that time, he would definitely be unlucky.

His greatest advantage was not his golden claws, speed, or smelly farts, but endurance.

Therefore, he naturally wanted to expend it.

"Bang\!"

The savage's fist hit the ground heavily\!

Immediately, stone fragments splashed and the ground cracked, forming a pit.

From this, it could be seen how terrifying the strength of this punch was.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled as he continued to dodge.

The savage was furious. He swung his fists and chased after them. Bang bang\! Before long, he shattered the huge rocks around him and splashed everywhere\!

"Boom\!"

The savage suddenly jumped up, waved his fists, and descended from the sky, causing the ground to tremble violently. A few deep cracks appeared on the ground, extending to the cliffs on both sides.

The chimpanzees surrounding them could not stand steadily and fell to the ground.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye took the opportunity to appear behind the savage and suddenly grabbed at his back\!

However, the sharp golden claws only scratched a patch of fur and a few bloody wounds. They did not pierce through the other party's thick muscles.

"Roar —"

The savage immediately roared and suddenly raised his huge foot to kick over\!

Chu Xiaoye only felt a shadow attack and hurriedly jumped up. A stream of air spewed out from behind him and flew over the head of the savage, landing in front of him.

Although this grab did not cause any fatal wounds to the savages, it was the first time they had gained an advantage after fighting for so long.

From this, it could be seen that the wild man's speed and reaction speed were gradually decreasing from its peak state.

Chu Xiaoye calmed down and continued to fight patiently, not giving the other party a chance to swing his fists at close range.

Although his golden claws were sharp, the other party's claws were longer and also as sharp as blades. If they grabbed him, it would not be easy to survive.

Therefore, he had been avoiding a head-on confrontation with the other party.

After so many life and death battles, he would never underestimate any enemy.

"Roar —"

The savage was furious. He continued to swing his fists and chase. At the same time, he actually ordered the surrounding chimpanzees to shrink the encirclement and narrow the space in the middle.

The little girl saw through his intentions and immediately cried out, "It's not fair\! It's not fair\!"

As he spoke, he took off the flower on his head and threw it on the ground.

This time, the savage ignored her. His eyes were red and his face was distorted. He was clearly extremely angry and chased after Chu Xiaoye crazily.

He seemed to understand that if he continued to be exhausted by the other party, he would be defeated sooner or later.

The twenty-over chimpanzees surrounding him immediately walked forward and narrowed the encirclement. At the same time, they roared in unison, wanting to pressure Chu Xiaoye.

"Whoosh\!"

Blood splashed as the stomach of a black gorilla was broken and its internal organs flowed all over the ground.

Catherine suddenly attacked.

Tilly looked at her and rolled her eyes, as if blaming her for being impatient. However, she suddenly jumped up and pounced at the black gorilla on the other side.

Hence, the chaotic battle started.

Other than the chimpanzee that was holding the little girl, all the chimpanzees pounced at Tilly and Catherine, roaring fiercely.

The space at the top of the mountain was not wide, and there were cliffs on both sides.

There were no trees here, but there were many huge rocks. Hence, Catherine and Tilly treated these rocks as trees in the forest, jumping around to kill enemies or hide.

In the blink of an eye, the mountain was dyed red with blood.

Many black gorillas fell to the ground and let out miserable cries.

The strong smell of blood filled the air and was swept away by the wind.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye finally stopped dodging and punched the savage.

Their bodies trembled, and they took a few steps back before pouncing forward again.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that a familiar number was imprinted on the foot that the savage raised\!

It turned out that this savage was not born in the wild, nor was it evolved from a chimpanzee. Instead, humans had deliberately let it in\!

It was very possible that he was a human himself and had been placed in a group of chimpanzees in the wild since he was young. Furthermore, he had been injected with something terrifying\!

"Roar —"

Just as he seized the opportunity and grabbed the wild man's shoulder, the wild man suddenly opened his mouth and let out a deafening roar\!

This roar seemed to carry a terrifying sound wave. Not only did it make Chu Xiaoye dizzy, he suddenly lost his strength. Even the fighting chimpanzees suddenly fell to the ground.

As for Catherine and Tilly, they clearly could not withstand it either. Their bodies stiffened and they swayed, almost falling.

Some chimpanzees' noses and mouths were actually bleeding from the shock, as if their internal organs had been broken\!

The strange thing was that only the human girl was safe and sound.

"Bang\!"

The savage seized the opportunity and suddenly punched Chu Xiaoye's head, sending him flying\!

After flying for more than ten meters, he almost fell off the cliff beside him\!

Chu Xiaoye fell heavily to the ground. He had a splitting headache and his vision turned black. He almost fainted.

Only at this moment did the roar from the savage gradually stop.

This roar clearly exhausted a lot of his strength and spirit.

The savage shook his head and swayed his body a few times. He immediately pulled himself together, clenched his fists, and jumped towards Chu Xiaoye.
