Chapter 586: Former Partner

Old friends met.

However, the other party was clearly no longer the companion who had once respected him as king and charged for him, protecting his home with his life.

He had changed.

He had changed too.

Mixed Fur, who had been injected with the T-rex gene by humans, looked at the golden-haired lion in front of him in bewilderment. He felt that it looked familiar, but he also felt that it was so unfamiliar.

Mixed Fur's body became super huge and his strength increased many times. His ferocity was even greater than before.

Furthermore, he was especially prone to anger and madness. He could enter a bloodthirsty state and lose his mind in an instant.

The T-rex's genes had already completely occupied his body.

He stopped in place and suddenly let out a low growl. For the first time, he saw that the enemy did not attack immediately but was asking something.

"Who are you?"

He seemed to have lost his memory or temporarily recovered some rationality.

He kept feeling that he had seen this golden-haired lion somewhere before, but everything in the past was blank in his mind.

Chu Xiaoye stared at his eyes and took two steps forward. He did not answer, "I'm your king." Because this would definitely immediately anger this lion that was already trying its best to suppress its violence.

"I'm your friend."

He answered calmly.

One sentence was enough.

Because in this situation, no matter how much he said, it was useless.

"Friends?"

Mixed Fur stared at him suspiciously, feeling a little surprised.

Did he have friends too?

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the other three lions behind him no longer had the patience.

They bared their fangs and prepared to attack.

The violent aura in Mixed Fur's body was immediately stimulated.

He growled and issued an order.

"Whoosh\!"

The three lions were the first to pounce out and pounced at Chu Xiaoye together\!

Although they were not as big as Chu Xiaoye, they had been injected with the genes of carnivores and were fierce and strong. They were almost fearless.

The strength of the three lions when they pounced together could be imagined.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and did not move. When the three lions pounced in front of him, he suddenly raised his upper body and attacked with his two claws from left to right. With two bangs, he sent two of the lions flying\!

The remaining lion pounced in front of him and bit his neck\!

However, the mutated sharp teeth that were like daggers were suddenly blocked by the dense golden fur on Chu Xiaoye's neck\!

The golden fur looked soft but was exceptionally tough. Its sharp teeth could not penetrate it\!

At the same time, a black armor condensed on Chu Xiaoye's skin.

"Chi\!"

Before the lion could react, Chu Xiaoye's golden claw had already pierced into its head like cutting tofu. Then, he pulled gently and broke its head into two\!

The lion's body trembled and it let go of its fangs helplessly. Its body turned limp and it fell to the ground, instantly dying\!

As for the other two lions that had been sent flying by Chu Xiaoye, they had long fallen into a corner and did not move.

The accumulated strength on Chu Xiaoye's claws shattered their heads with a slap and they died\!

In less than a minute, the three strong lions that had been injected with human genes and killed countless ferocious beasts died\!

Chu Xiaoye still stood in place and did not move.

Mixed Fur looked at him coldly. His arrogance and disdain when he first came out turned grave and serious.

"Who are you?"

He asked again.

Why did he feel a sense of familiarity when he saw this golden fur, smelled this aura, and looked at this face, but he could not remember?

Furthermore, the violence and bloodthirst in his body did not decrease. Instead, because of the stimulation of the three lions' death, he could not suppress it anymore.

"I'm your friend, an old friend."

Chu Xiaoye still answered like this.

He paused for a moment and said, "You still have many friends on the grassland and under the free sky. Do you remember how you left there and came here?"

Although Chu Xiaoye knew that things were irreversible, he still had a trace of hope in his heart, hoping that this old friend in front of him could remember something.

At least, he would not fight him with his life.

Mixed Fur stared at him with flickering eyes. His head was slightly tilted, as if he was thinking carefully.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he continued to talk about the past.

Mixed Fur took a few steps forward and came close to him. His nose twitched and he smelled the scent on his body. He said suspiciously, "Are you really my friend?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at him sincerely. Just as he was about to speak, a huge claw suddenly flew over and slapped his head\!

A huge force came from the claw\!

Chu Xiaoye was caught off guard and flew out. He immediately felt his head tremble and was dizzy.

He fell heavily to the ground, his ears buzzing.

Mixed Fur stood in place, his eyes confused and suspicious. He had long become cunning and sly.

It turned out that all the expressions he revealed just now were fake\!

He did not remember anything.

He had only endured for so long because this golden-haired lion was too strong and wanted to approach and suddenly attack.

He was very confident in his strength.

There were once a few saber-toothed tigers that were his size that had their heads slapped by him. Their brains exploded on the spot and they died\!

Therefore, his slap that he had secretly gathered strength for a long time landed on the golden-haired lion's head. Even if he could not kill it immediately, he could still seriously injure it.

He grinned, his eyes filled with ridicule. He raised his head and walked over, preparing to kill this beautiful fellow with one claw.

"Trying to get close to me? Do you really think that I won't kill you just because you know me?"

Mixed Fur bared his fangs and prepared to bite off the spine of this golden-haired lion, making it lie on the ground and wail miserably, never to stand up again.

However, when he walked close, the golden-haired lion that was originally lying motionless on the ground suddenly moved and slowly stood up.

Mixed Fur stopped in his tracks, his eyes filled with shock and disbelief.

Chu Xiaoye's head was intact. It was not bleeding, broken, or even injured.

He looked calmly at the familiar and unfamiliar mixed fur lion in front of him. The last hope in his heart was finally destroyed.

This was not his friend.

The former Mixed Fur was long dead.

This was only a cruel, cunning, and bloodthirsty beast. It was a tool for humans to kill other animals\!

His heart was very heavy and angry.

"Roar—"

Mixed Fur was furious and his eyes were filled with madness and bloodthirst. He suddenly roared and jumped up, pouncing on him\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye extended his golden claws and no longer hesitated.

His two companions, who had once fought side by side and lived and died together, were finally going to fight with their lives under the control of humans and end with their lives.
