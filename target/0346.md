Chapter 346: Untitled

"Roar\!

Tilly bared her fangs again and looked covetously at the true pearl necklace on the little girl's neck. She let out a threatening roar.

The little girl hesitated for a moment and prepared to take off the necklace on her neck to give it to her.

Chu Xiaoye immediately raised his claws to stop her and tidied her collar again. He looked at Tilly warningly and told her not to be delusional.

This thing was too dazzling. If she wore it on her neck, be it hunting or fighting enemies, she would be greatly affected.

Tilly curled her lips and snorted. She turned her head proudly to show that she did not care\!

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others quickly returned with the three water buffaloes.

When everyone started to eat, the little girl seemed to remember the pain of eating raw beef that night and hesitated again.

However, she knew very well that if she went hungry, she would soon lose her strength and fall behind. Then, she could only wait for death silently.

Although his stomach rejected this flesh, at least he did not vomit it out.

As long as he could fill his stomach and replenish his energy, as long as he could survive, what was there to hesitate about?

Could it be that there was anything more terrifying than death in this world?

The little girl pulled out the snow-white knife from her waist and went to Chu Xiaoye's side. Her pitiful eyes looked at him pleadingly.

Chu Xiaoye made way and agreed to let her eat together.

The little girl carefully cut off a piece of steak with her small knife. Just as she was about to send it into her mouth like they did and bite it, she suddenly thought of something.

She sat down on the ground and started to cut the piece of beef in her hand into a thin piece with a knife. Then, she sent it into her little mouth, chewed a few times, and swallowed it.

This time, it did not seem to be as painful as before.

The stench of the thin piece of beef was greatly reduced. She did not need to bite until her mouth full of blood and felt much better.

The little girl seemed to have found the trick and beamed. She used the knife to cut it again and ate with relish, looking elegant and refined.

Little Curly Tail, who was opposite her, spat out blood and laughed.

This was the first time he had seen someone eat meat like this. It was too comical.

The little girl did not care about the gazes of others and ate very happily. Soon, she ate a piece of beef.

She did not eat more.

The adaptation of the stomach to this food was progressive. If he ate too much at once, he would definitely vomit. At that time, he would have wasted the food.

She had never known how precious food was. Ever since she came to the grassland, she understood that the survival of every animal was difficult. Many a time, they would even pay with their lives to fill their stomachs.

Even this powerful pride was no exception.

After eating and drinking his fill, he lay down to rest.

Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail, and the others climbed up the tree. The other members lay down on the grass.

When the little girl saw that there was still some water and beef left, she immediately took out a small knife and cut it down piece by piece. She wrapped it with a wide bush leaf and prepared to eat it when she was hungry on the way.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the tree and looked down at her with a hint of admiration.

However, although this little girl had the intelligence to take precautions, she did not have any experience in storms.

There was no salt and no honey. If he covered it like this, it would be strange if it did not stink tomorrow.

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye suddenly thought of his life on the other side of the mountain in the future. At that time, he could completely make natural spicy beef jerky and store it. He could eat it as a snack usually and use it to fill his stomach when there was a lack of food.

In the forest and bushes over there, there were many seasoning bushes, chili, pepper, orange jessamine, and so on. They could be used to marinate and make them.

However, his taste buds might not find it delicious now.

The little girl wrapped the beef and placed it under the tree. Then, she sat down under the tree and leaned against it. She looked into the distant darkness in a daze.

No one knew if he was thinking about his future or his dead parents.

Chu Xiaoye knew that even if he did not chase her away, it would be difficult for her to survive on the grassland. How long she could last would depend on herself.

She had no way out now. She could only follow them to the grassland on the other side of the mountain.

Otherwise, once she left this team, what awaited her was the prey of other beasts.

The smell of blood from the three water buffaloes floated in the air and was sent far away by the night wind.

In the night, pairs of cold and dark eyes lit up around him. More and more eyes appeared and approached, but they suddenly stopped in place, hesitating.

The aura of the pride made all the carnivores on the grassland afraid.

Even if they ate the remaining food, as long as they did not leave, no one dared to use it.

The king of the grassland did not have an undeserved reputation.

"Roarâ€”"

The roar of Blue Eyes immediately frightened the carnivores and they fled in all directions.

With this lion king's huge body and powerful aura, let alone these small carnivores, even other lions would piss their pants and leave when they saw it.

Late at night.

The little girl closed her eyes and fell asleep exhausted.

A black shadow suddenly came to her side silently and snatched the bag of beef beside her with its mouth, then jumped onto the tree.

There was a big piece of honey hanging on the tree. Chu Xiaoye had just picked it from the forest.

With his current vision and speed, he could easily find these things in the forest. Furthermore, he had already searched last time, and there were still some left on the mountain wall.

Chu Xiaoye placed the bag of beef on a branch and slowly opened it. He used his claws to prick the thin pieces of beef and smeared them evenly with honey, then placed them on the branch to dry.

There was no wind tonight, and he was not afraid that they would fall.

These beef were cut very thin and almost transparent. If they were spread out to dry, they would quickly dry. Even if they were not dried and were wrapped in this honey, they would not decay quickly. When they ate them tomorrow, they would still be very fresh and sweet.

Chu Xiaoye did not make it especially for the human girl under the tree. He was just suddenly greedy and wanted to eat a few pieces on the way.

After applying honey to all the beef slices, it was already late at night.

Chu Xiaoye lay down at the side and closed his eyes. He soon fell asleep.

From the beginning to the end, everything he did was silently watched by Catherine under the tree, as well as Tilly, who was on the tree beside him.

They were even more puzzled.

They could not understand his actions along the way. What was his relationship with this upright little animal? Why did he always care about and protect her strangely?

Although on the surface, he appeared very distant and cold.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth cracked slightly, as if he had a good dream.

In his dream, he seemed to have become a human again.
