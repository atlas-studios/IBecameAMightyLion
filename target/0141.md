Chapter 141: The Hero Taking Over

"Roar\!"

The lion's roar was mixed with a strange elephant's cry. On the battlefield in the bushes, it suddenly sounded\!

The battle finally started\!

The Lion Alliance's manes fluttered as they charged forward aggressively with an unstoppable momentum\!

They bared their sharp fangs, their eyes filled with ferocity and bloodthirst as they pounced ferociously\!

Chu Xiaoye ran up and fought two enemies alone\!

The little elephant raised its long nose and wagged its tail as it ran towards the adult lion\!

The thin and weak brothers, on the other hand, pounced at another adult lion that was in its prime\!

Lars stood at the side and watched the battle suddenly erupt. Just as he was at a loss as to what to do, he suddenly saw that the brat who was overestimating his capabilities suddenly jump up high and slap his two sworn brothers' faces with a bang\!

His two sworn brothers were both at the peak of adult lions. They were strong and powerful, but at this moment, their heads tilted and they fell to the ground\!

They did not have the time to retaliate\!

Before they could get up from the ground, the kid suddenly turned around and rushed over. "Bang\! Bang\!" Two more slaps landed fiercely on their heads\!

Then, his two brothers, who made other lions tremble in fear, closed their eyes and fainted\!

From the beginning to the end, they did not even use a single move\!

Lars froze in place, stunned.

On the other side.

The Chino brothers were fighting with the strong male lion with a black mane.

The two brothers fought together and were actually no match for the strong male lion. They were slapped to the ground by the other party's claws\!

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly rushed over from the side and slapped the head of the strong male lion\!

Then, the strong male lion that was showing its might also fell to the ground and fainted\!

As for the remaining adult lion, it was actually swung around by the elephant's nose and could not resist at all\!

When it saw that the three brothers, who had just been majestic, were actually lying on the ground and probably dead, it was terrified. Its soul flew out and it hurriedly whimpered, asking Lars for help.

He seemed to be shouting, "Fifth Brother\! Save me\! I surrender\! I surrender\! Quickly let your brother's mount hold its nose\!"

Lars looked stunned and at a loss.

All his previous pride and flaunting thoughts turned to nothingness at this moment.

He felt ashamed and embarrassed\!

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye growled and told the little elephant to stop playing with him.

He was a lion after all. If you used your long nose to pick and touch his entire body, you would be insulting his pride\!

The little elephant proudly put away its nose and turned to return.

Chu Xiaoye walked towards the lioness and daughter pair.

The brothers were excited as they followed behind their young brother. They looked at the unconscious lion alliance on the ground with pride and excitement.

They were proud of their choice\!

Their big brother was the true big brother. He was peerlessly sharp and no lion could compare to him\!

In the future, this entire grassland would belong to their Lion and Elephant Alliance\!

Their big brother would become the only king of this grassland\!

When Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the lioness and her daughter, they were already trembling in fear. The lioness did not even dare to show her fangs.

She originally thought that the cruel male lion alliance was extremely strong and would wipe out all the nearby territories. Unexpectedly, this new young male lion was even stronger\!

The Lion Alliance could not resist him at all\!

Did this young lion also want to kill her children and occupy their territory and lionesses like her?

She protected her daughter behind her, but her entire body was trembling and she no longer dared to resist.

She knew that this young lion only needed a slap to take her life.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in front of them and stared at them for a while before roaring. He looked at the distant grassland and gestured for them to leave quickly.

He would not kill these lions.

It was not because of his brother, Lars, but because there was no need.

The kings of this territory and this pride were already dead. Without the protection of a new king, it was difficult for those female lions to survive this season.

Without the protection of an adult lion, they could not compete with other competitors.

And this lion alliance was not wrong.

They were only following the ancient rules of the pride to change dynasties and renew their genes.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop them from killing the mother and daughter because of justice.

There was no justice in battles between animals.

He only thought of Little Curly Tail, his mother, and Mei Mei and the others. He could not bear to do so.

As for what happened next, it had nothing to do with him.

He would not care anymore.

He turned around and prepared to leave with the little elephant.

There was a larger forest ahead. The little elephant needed to eat, and he needed to rest for the night.

After taking a few steps, he stopped again and turned around to look at his big brother.

He suddenly raised his left palm and waved it at him, his eyes filled with encouragement.

He seemed to be saying, "Brother, all the best\!"

Then, he brought the little elephant to the bushes in front of him.

The Chino brothers hurriedly followed from the left and right.

Lars stood in place and looked at him in a daze. His entire body was stiff as a stone sculpture and he could not recover from it for a long time.

The lioness and her daughter did not leave.

The female lion looked at Lars fearfully, then at the figure that was gradually walking further and further away. She suddenly brought her daughters and followed.

Her daughter was still young and she could not leave alone with her.

If that was the case, she would probably be killed by other carnivores and wandering lions as soon as he walked out of the territory.

And this lion alliance would never let her go.

Hence, she decided to follow the young male cub.

No matter where he went, they followed.

He was so powerful and saved them\!

She brought her daughter and followed quickly.

When the young lion suddenly stopped and turned around to look at them in shock, she bravely raised her head and looked at him determinedly.

It was as if he was saying, "Save the lion until the end. Even if you have to grit your teeth, you have to bring the lions you save with you\!"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned.

A small elephant, two lions, and now a female lion and a young cub\!

Most importantly, they were a strange combination to him.

Was he constantly advancing towards non-mainstream on his journey?

It was bad enough that he took in the male lions, but now, there were two female lions following him. He, the dignified future lion king, was still underage\!

Was she brazenly clinging to him and looking for an honest lion to take over?

"Moo â€”"

At this moment, the little elephant, who was using its nose to curl the bushes, suddenly raised one of its hind legs and turned its head, looking at him with a burning gaze.

She seemed to be saying, "Brother, look, I'm a female too."
