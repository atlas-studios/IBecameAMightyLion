Chapter 236: The Snowstorm Comes

Under the sun.

The cold wind was cold and snowflakes fluttered.

To the animals on the grassland, this was a rare scene.

Chu Xiaoye squatted alone on the rhinoceros’ back and raised his head to look at the increasingly dense snowflakes in the sky. He suddenly missed Little Curly Tail and the others.

He wondered what it looked like there now.

After returning from the snow mountain, he decided to pick them up immediately.

Tilly and Catherine walked together like friends that had not met in years. They rubbed their bodies and head from time to time to show their friendliness.

Catherine had a cold expression but did not refuse.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this cunning little white lion must have realized that Catherine was not ordinary. Therefore, it was trying to rope her in and please her.

Unfortunately, she had fawned on the wrong person.

Catherine belonged to him.

Therefore, he should be the one to please this little white lion.

The mixed fur lion king's team followed at the back.

The temperature here was torture to them.

The closer they were to the sea in the north, the lower the temperature.

The two strong warthogs had already started to tremble from the cold.

They were not afraid of heat or droughts but they could not resist the cold wind that could almost penetrate their bones.

It was snowing again and the temperature was still dropping.

The three lions behind the lion king, the female lion, and the male leopard, Blue, clearly could not take it either.

The little white lion was preparing to bring them to the border of the sea. It should be related to the giant strange fish from before.

However, if they could not even resist this weather, how could they resist those enemies?

The sea in the north was different from the sea previously. The temperature was terrifyingly low. Ordinary grassland animals could not live there.

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment and decided to let them stay. He would go to the forest and find a cave to avoid the snow.

After all, this team was already his. He did not want them to suffer any losses.

When the time came to welcome Little Curly Tail and the others, they might still be needed.

In order to prevent them from having a conflict with the white tiger and her daughter in the forest, he jumped down from the rhinoceros' back. Under many gazes, he raised his hind legs and sprinkled a few drops of urine on the two warthogs, the female lion, and the three lions, leaving his mark.

He had saved the life of the white tiger and her daughter. Presumably, they would not return kindness with ingratitude and hurt his subordinates.

Just as he walked in front of the mixed fur lion king and was about to give it a few drops, the mixed fur lion king hurriedly retreated and lay on the ground, its eyes filled with begging.

He was a mighty and majestic lion, so how could he use urine to protect himself?

He would rather die in battle\!

Blue the male leopard was naturally unwilling.

Chu Xiaoye did not force them anymore and gestured for them to leave quickly.

Because he realized that the urine he had just peed out had already frozen.

The snow grew heavier and the temperature was already terrifyingly low.

In a while, the two warthogs would probably freeze and not even be able to walk.

The mixed fur lion king originally wanted to follow them to fight on the battlefield, but he knew that this team could not do without him. Otherwise, before they could walk into the forest, they would be wiped out by the other prides.

Furthermore, although he had a thick mane to cover his body, he was still bone-chilling.

"Roar\!"

He roared and immediately turned around with the team and left in a hurry.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at Catherine.

Catherine was also looking at him. Seeing him look over, she immediately understood his intentions. Her heart warmed and she immediately stuck out her chest. She shook the snowflakes on her body to show that she could tolerate it.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He walked over and stopped in front of her. He stuck out his head and stared at the crystal tentacle on her mouth, wanting to observe it carefully.

His head was almost against Catherine's.

Catherine lowered her eyes and was flustered, not knowing what he was going to do.

Could it be that he wanted to pee on her body too?

"Bang\!"

At this moment, Tilly suddenly rushed over and pushed Chu Xiaoye away with her body. She looked at him disdainfully, as if she was reprimanding him.

"You haven't killed all the enemies yet, and you still have the mood to pee?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her crystal whisker and was a little dejected. Why did these two female lions have shining crystal whiskers but he did not?

Could it be that he was really weaker than these two little girls?

He could not accept this.

"Chiâ€”"

He raised his hind legs and peed in front of this little white lion.

He had yet to kill all the enemies. But what did it have to do with him peeing?

Could it be that he could not pee before the enemy was killed?

What was this logic?

It was too domineering and arrogant\!

Chu Xiaoye glared at her and continued to pee, not giving her any face.

However, he soon felt a trace of pain.

He looked down and suddenly realized that the urine he peed out had turned into a thin ice pillar. It fell to the ground in a parabola and became thicker and thicker.

He was shocked and hurriedly stopped peeing. He clamped his hind leg and broke the ice pillar with a crack.

"Sssâ€¦"

He grimaced in pain and did not dare to pee again.

This damn weather was so perverted\!

Tilly was already lying on the ground, rolling back and forth in the snow. She opened her mouth and narrowed her eyes. She swung her four legs around and let out a series of cries, as if she was already dying from laughter and could not stand up.

Catherine lay down at the side and stared at him quietly. She had no intention of mocking him.

His girl was the best.

Chu Xiaoye looked calm and pretended that nothing had happened. He walked to the side of the giant rhinoceros and jumped up.

However, when he stood on the rhinoceros’ back, he realized that sometimes, standing high did not mean that he could see far. Instead, he would be lonely and cold.

He immediately jumped down.

At this moment.

The north wind howled and blew towards them. Snow fluttered everywhere.

Their bodies were soon covered in snow.

The temperature fell vertically.

Even though the heat in his body warmed his entire body and resisted the cold, Chu Xiaoye still felt cold.

As for Catherine, she was also trembling after a cold wind.

On the other hand, the little white lion seemed to be used to the climate here and was still calm.

This could not go on.

The snow grew heavier and the wind blew more and more violently.

They had to wait for the snow to stop before continuing forward.

Otherwise, he would freeze to death.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw a vast expanse of white around him. It was flat and could be seen without any place to hide.

He stopped and raised his claws, stabbing into the hard ice on the ground with a crack.

It seemed that he could only dig a hole and hide it inside.

The sharp golden claws easily dug open the ice.

A cave soon appeared on the ground.

Catherine hurriedly came over to help and quickly dug the hole deep, then started digging horizontally.

Tilly stood on the ice and raised her head to look at the distant sea. Although she was anxious, she knew that she could not continue forward in this ghastly weather.

She called out to the giant rhinoceros and told it to find a place to hide first and wait for the snowstorm to pass.

No matter how strong it was, it was afraid of nature.

The storms here could sometimes even curl up a giant elephant, let alone them.

The rhinoceros walked not far away, raised its hooves, and started to hit the ground heavily.

Soon, he also smashed a hole with brute force and crawled in. Then, he used his sharp rhinoceros horn to continue digging.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine hid in the cave. Without the cold wind and the invasion of the snow, they immediately felt much warmer.

They squeezed together. Just as their eyes met, Tilly suddenly crawled in and swung her golden claws. She started to expand the cave and looked at him strangely.

She seemed to be saying, "Why did you dig the cave so narrow? You did it on purpose, right?"

Chu Xiaoye also felt that it was a little crowded and ignored her. He waved his claws and also expanded the cave.

Catherine turned her head and looked coldly at the little white lion.
