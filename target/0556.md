Chapter 556: Zoo

It was like a zoo.

There were fences, guards, and workers throwing food around.

The humans were divided into a few tribes and each occupied an empty space.

They were all naked, thin, and wooden. When they saw the food thrown in, they rushed up like gorillas and grabbed it in their hands, biting it with their teeth.

There were men, women, old people, and children.

In order to fight for food, one of the children was bitten to death.

Chu Xiaoye stood outside the fence, as if he was looking at the animals in the zoo.

He did not dare to continue looking.

The fat girl introduced them with relish, her eyes filled with hatred and ridicule.

She had seen too many human misdeeds on the grassland.

Her family and friends had also died under human shotguns because of the two ivory in their mouths.

Therefore, even though she had become an orc, she still had a deep hatred for humans.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and tried his best to pretend to be very calm. He said, "Let's go. I feel nauseous watching. I'm afraid I won't be able to eat lunch."

The fat girl asked curiously, "You're feeling nauseous? You're a lion, what kind of blood have you not eaten?"

Chu Xiaoye shrugged and said, "But I'm an elf now and have yet to transform. Furthermore, we had no choice but to survive like that back then. Since we have a better life now, let's look forward. Why do we have to be immersed in the past and be unable to free ourselves?"

The fat girl looked at the scene of humans snatching food and said, "Remembering the hardships and thinking the sweetness. Encourage yourself to work harder and not return to the past."

She was once an elephant. Although she was tall, she was still very fragile and difficult.

Which animal living on the grassland was not fragile?

Luo Fei patted her arm and said, "Fat girl, it's all in the past. There's no need to think about the past. Let's go."

He looked back at the humans inside who were like wild beasts and his heart suddenly trembled.

Perhaps, this was the world outside.

The mutated beasts were even stronger. Under the attack of the virus, humans became fewer and weaker. Hence, the animals they had previously locked in the zoo to watch suddenly turned around and became owners, locking them in the zoo and making them objects to watch.

This was not impossible.

Perhaps the collapse of the outside world would only affect a portion of the creatures, and another portion of the creatures would survive in another way.

The food chain was reversed, the rules were changed, and everything became unbelievable.

If there was a chance, he would definitely go out to take a look.

The grassland, villages, towns, and cities were all over the place. They wanted to see what the world that they were once familiar with had become and what positions the familiar creatures had changed.

"Smelly fart king, you don't like me like this, right?"

On the way back, the fat girl suddenly asked.

Although she was fat, she was not stupid. Otherwise, how could she become a big boss in this dark place where all the forces were complicated?

Chu Xiaoye did not answer and said meaningfully, "You don't like me like this either, right?"

The fat girl smiled and said, "In the past, you were so domineering and free. You could do whatever you wanted. The current you is not like you."

Chu Xiaoye sighed and said, "Everyone has changed."

The fat girl also said, "Yes, everyone has changed."

Three days later, the fat girl smoked as she had hoped. Furthermore, she smoked for an entire day. Of course, the rest was not wasted. She put it in the bottle and prepared to save it for slowly smoking.

Chu Xiaoye could not complain about her strange fetish.

The next day, Chu Xiaoye left with the elven girls on fat and healthy horses.

The fat girl brought the people and sent them five kilometers away. When they could not see anyone, she shouted, "Smelly fart king\! When you find a good place, I will definitely go and seek refuge with you\!"

Chu Xiaoye heard it but did not respond.

He did not know if he could return safely, let alone find the ideal place.

Perhaps they would meet again. Perhaps they would never meet again.

The morning sun rose and it was another sunny day.

They traveled during the day and found a place to rest at night.

Catherine's scouting skills were becoming better and better. She helped them avoid many orcs along the way.

Half a month later, they finally passed through the orc empire and arrived at the human capital.

Southern Tang Country was a human empire with a prosperous culture and economy. The king had always advocated peace. Even if it bordered the orc empire, there were rarely any military conflicts.

A trade route was opened here, and two trading cities for goods were even specially built. They attracted merchants from all over the world, and merchants came here to trade every day.

Be it humans, orcs, or elves, they could see it.

However, for safety reasons, Chu Xiaoye and the others still wore bandanas and covered their ears. Doya covered the beast horns by her ears.

This was the custom in some places, so no one was surprised.

They rode their horses and came to a bustling town. It was noisy and all sorts of merchants flowed endlessly.

Before entering the town, they got down from their horses and led the horses forward to avoid being too ostentatious.

It was already dusk and the sky was about to turn dark.

Since there was such a prosperous town, they naturally could not sleep in the wilderness and get bitten by the mosquitoes.

In this situation, it was definitely safer to sneak into the crowd.

Human countries were safer during the day and it was difficult to say at night.

Chu Xiaoye and the others found a slightly larger inn in the town and walked in.

The waiter came out eagerly and helped them bring the horses to the stall to prepare the food.

Doya brought a bag of gold coins and one gold coin with her. It was enough for them to open a few rooms and eat a few feasts.

Unfortunately, there were only two rooms left in this inn.

Seeing that they were a little hesitant, the boss hurriedly smiled and said, "The inns on this street are full every day. If you came a moment later, probably not a single room would be left. The other inns are in the same situation. If you don't believe me, you can ask the few people eating over there. They searched the streets and every inn was full, so they returned."

Chu Xiaoye decided and said, "Boss, let's have two rooms. I'll send some food up later."

The sky was about to turn dark and there were so many people on the street. If they went to find other inns, if it was really as this boss said, wouldn't they have to sleep in the wilderness again?

If they were discovered by the patrolling human soldiers, trouble would definitely follow.

"Okay\!"

The boss immediately helped them book a room and let the waiter guide them up.

"Night, there are only two beds. How would we sleep?"

When they went up, Lanisi whispered in Chu Xiaoye's ear.

Chu Xiaoye knew at a glance that she had ulterior motives and wanted to be alone with him in a room to torture him wantonly.

He hurriedly said, "Catherine and I will sleep on the bench. You girls can do whatever you want."

Lanisi pinched his waist fiercely and gave him a resentful look.

Chu Xiaoye grinned and sighed inwardly. What a proud and pure queen she was in the past. Look at how she had become? If he did not accompany her for a night, she would be like a resentful woman. Heh, women\!

Fortunately, the two rooms were next to each other.

The waiter led them to the door, pushed it open, and left.

Chu Xiaoye led the way into the room on the right.

Catherine followed in without landing.

Lanisi looked at Fei'er and the others, feeling a little conflicted.

The few girls looked at her and waited for her distribution.

There were only two beds and the four of them could not sleep together.

Lanisi sighed in her heart and could only say, "Doya, come in with me. The two of us will sleep together. Night will sleep on the bench with Catherine. Then, Vilis, Denise, and Fei'er, the three of you will sleep in the same room."

Doya blushed and hurriedly waved her hand. "No, Sister Lanisi, I'd better sleep in this room here."

Before Lanisi could reply, she immediately ran in as if she was escaping.

Lanisi could only look at Vilis.

Without a word, Vilis followed Doya into the room.

Before Lanisi could look over, Denise followed behind Vilis and walked in.

Hence, only Fei'er stood there.

Fei'er smiled shyly and said with anticipation, "Your Majesty, can I? I promise to sleep well and not disturb you and Lord Night."

Lanisi was helpless and could only say, "Go in. Remember to not speak nonsense."

Fei'er nodded repeatedly and said, "Your Majesty, don't worry. Fei'er's little mouth is very tight."

Soon, the waiter brought over a sumptuous dinner.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine ate a lot.

Lanisi and Fei'er did not eat much. Although they had gradually adapted to the food, they would still feel uncomfortable if they ate too much at once.

The sky soon turned dark.

The hall downstairs was even more lively.

The sounds of drinking, fighting, and chatting could be heard endlessly.

However, fights rarely happened here. At most, they would curse at each other and say a few fierce words.

They were here to seek wealth. There was no need to provoke trouble for a moment of anger.

When outside, who was willing to have more enemies for no reason?

It lasted until dawn before the ground gradually quietened down.

However, the rooms here were not soundproof. Snores started to come from many rooms, and even some discordant sounds.

Most prosperous places hid filth.

Furthermore, to the people here, some industries were normal.

The brothels in Southern Tang were everywhere.

The peddlers and tourists here were mostly rich. It was normal for them to need some physiological comfort when they were outside without their wives.

However, when the rooms of the inn were not soundproof and were almost filled with discordant sounds, some people felt terrible, and some people started to be afraid.

Chu Xiaoye, who was lying on the stool, started to be afraid.

Furthermore, in order to attract more business, the women who were invited cried out not only charmingly, but also exaggeratedly. Almost the entire inn could hear them.

The boss and the attendant were already used to it. They naturally did not go up to disturb them and remind them to be quiet.

Lanisi tossed and turned in bed, but she could not sleep.

Chu Xiaoye snored in fear, pretending that he was already asleep and very sleepy.

Lanisi faced outside the bed and opened her eyes in the darkness. She looked at him faintly and listened to the clear voice coming from next door. Her entire body was hot and she was not sleepy.

"Your Majesty, you're so hot. Are you sick?"

Fei'er slept inside and realized that her body was very hot. Furthermore, she could not fall asleep after tossing and turning. She hurriedly asked in concern.

Lanisi ignored her and did not say anything.

Seeing that she was not saying anything, Fei'er became even more worried. She hurriedly reached out and touched her forehead, saying anxiously, "Your Majesty, it's so hot. You're really sick. Let Lord Night get up and help you get the medicine?"

Just as Lanisi was about to say that there was no need, her heart suddenly skipped a beat. She snorted twice to show that she was already a little dizzy from the fever.

When Fei'er saw this, she immediately sat up and flipped over from her body. She got down the bed and ran in front of Chu Xiaoye with her bare feet. She pushed him and said, "Lord Night, Lord Night\! Her Majesty is sick and her body is hot. Go and take a look\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly got up and walked to the side of the bed. He reached out and touched Lanisi's forehead, realizing that it was indeed a little hot.

Lanisi closed her eyes and deliberately snorted twice, looking very uncomfortable.

"Lord Night, what should we do? Let's go get medicine for Her Majesty?"

Fei'er said anxiously.

Chu Xiaoye thought about the shop he had seen on the road for 100 days and said, "I don't know where there are pharmacies. Furthermore, it's so late. The pharmacies must have closed long ago."

"Then what should we do? Her Majesty must be feeling terrible. Look, Her Majesty is dizzy from the fever."

Fei'er was so anxious that she was about to cry.

This girl was pure and did not expect her respected queen to be lying.

Chu Xiaoye reached out again and rubbed Lanisi's forehead.

At this moment, Lanisi suddenly moaned and revealed a painful expression. She let out a dreamy voice. "Night… Night…"

"Lord Night, Her Majesty must have seen you in his dream. Quick, save Her Majesty."

Fei'er also begged.

Chu Xiaoye could only say to her, "Fei'er, go and sleep on the stool."

He had a medicinal herb that could treat all sorts of colds and fevers, but it was not suitable for children.

Fei'er was puzzled. "Lord Night, why do you want me to sleep on the stool? The stool is very hard. I want to accompany Her Majesty."

Chu Xiaoye could only say, "I want to treat Her Majesty, so I want to sleep with her. You have to sleep on the stool, or I won't care."

When Fei'er heard this, she could only say, "Alright, I'll go sleep on the bench. Lord Night, hurry up. Her Majesty is in so much pain."

Chu Xiaoye took off his shoes and climbed in. He lay down beside the Elven Queen and glared at the pink-haired girl who was still standing by the bed. "Fei'er, go quickly\! You're not allowed to peep, understand?"

"Oh."

Fei'er left reluctantly and lay on the stool with her back turned.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and turned the Elven Queen over to face him. Just as he was about to kiss her to heal her, he suddenly realized that the girl was biting her lips and her body was trembling slightly, as if she was suppressing her laughter.

In an instant, he understood.

He had been played\!

Just as his expression changed drastically and he was about to jump up and escape, Lanisi suddenly hugged him and strangled his neck tightly. Her red lips leaned forward and she made him surrender completely. He could not escape\!

Fei'er quietly turned her head and opened her eyes to look.

In the darkness, there was also a pair of dark eyes looking blankly at the bed.

"So this is how Lord Night treats illnesses?"

Fei'er thought to herself. Then, her face started to heat up and her imagination ran wild. She hoped that one day, she would be sick too.

The night was quiet, but the inn was not.

A group of figures dressed in the night and covered their faces crossed the yard wall and rushed in from the back door of the inn.

Under the lead of one of the waiters, they quietly walked up the stairs.

The waiter brought them straight to the two rooms. He pointed at the door and gestured.

One of the men in black took out a bamboo tube and quietly pierced the window. He started to blow scarlet smoke towards one of the rooms.

The other night people were holding a sack and waiting.
