Chapter 122: Corpse

What happened?

From the way the two corpses were dead and in good condition, they should not have been caused by wild animals.

Ordinary beasts could not kill these Maasai who dared to fight an adult lion.

They were also carrying bows and knives at their waists.

What exactly killed them?

The corpse was already extremely rotten, and no fatal wounds could be seen.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and terrified.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail stood nervously beside him and looked at the dead humans, seemingly gloating.

They were the ones who caused his brother to lose his claws\!

They deserved it\!

The cold father walked over with the female lions.

They were not interested in these rotten and smelly corpses.

Chu Xiaoye continued to walk forward with an uneasy heart.

Soon, he discovered another corpse\!

This time, the corpses came one after another, seemingly running towards the hill in panic. In the end, before they could cross the hill, they fell to the ground\!

What was chasing after them and killing them in the end?

Looking at the dried corpses all over the ground in front of him, Chu Xiaoye felt a chill run down his spine and was terrified.

The cold father and the female lions also felt a little terrified.

The more terrified he was, the more curious he became.

Chu Xiaoye stabilized his mind and continued forward.

Along the way, they saw many corpses. They should be members of the same tribe.

However, why were there only human corpses here?

The Maasai were nomads and should have reared many cows and sheep. Now, the ground was filled with human corpses. Where were the cows and sheep?

Chu Xiaoye was filled with doubts. He quickened his steps and walked forward.

Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine followed closely behind him, looking very nervous.

The cold father and the female lions also seemed to be instinctively afraid.

However, they did not dare to leave alone and could only follow behind uneasily.

Chu Xiaoye followed the corpses on the ground and walked towards the borders of the grassland.

Soon, a forest appeared in front of him.

In the forest, an ancient village surrounded by a barbed fence appeared.

The houses in the village were built with mud and were even cruder than those in the slums.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down and walked carefully into the forest.

There were even more corpses on the grass in the forest. They were everywhere and densely packed.

The village was silent and did not move.

A dark and silent aura enveloped the entire forest.

Chu Xiaoye felt his blood run cold. He hesitated for a moment, but still gathered his courage and walked towards the earthen-yellow mud houses.

"Whoosh—"

Suddenly, a black shadow jumped out of a mud hut\!

It was a jackal\!

When the jackal saw this group of grassland beasts, it immediately peed its pants in fear and ran away\!

The pride looked at it in fear and did not chase after it.

Chu Xiaoye passed through the ruined fence and entered the village. He saw that the place was in a mess. All sorts of tools and clothes were scattered everywhere. Many mud houses had broken and fallen， as if something had collided into them.

"Roar—"

The cold father suddenly roared impatiently.

They were out to hunt, not to play. What was the meaning of looking endlessly?

He was responsible for the pride. There were still two young cubs waiting at home. He could not accompany these few little fellows to fool around anymore\!

He roared at the female lions and prepared to leave with them.

He was trembling.

"Baa —"

At this moment, the cry of a goat suddenly came from a mud house at the side.

The cold father's eyes immediately lit up in excitement.

The female lions immediately got excited\!

There was prey\!

They hurriedly surrounded it and blocked the path in front of the mud hut, preparing for a sure catch\!

"Roar—"

When everything was ready, the cold father took the lead and roared angrily before charging in\!

All the dignity that he had abandoned would be picked up again at this moment\!

He was the lion king\!

In this pride, he was the true pillar\!

"Whoosh—"

Just as his mane fluttered and he was about to charge into the house to catch the goat, a figure covered in snow-white fur suddenly rushed out of the house\!

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

The lion king, who was nearly 300 kilograms, was caught off guard and was sent flying\!

As for the bull-like figure, it continued to run as if it was flying, charging forward\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The four female lions that were blocking the door were instantly sent flying\!

"Baa —"

This terrifying monster still let out the cry of a sheep. In the blink of an eye, it rushed out of the village and fled\!

When Chu Xiaoye rushed over with Little Curly Tail and the others, they could not see any traces of the monster.

However, Chu Xiaoye had just clearly seen the monster that was as big as a cow. Its eyes were like that of a devil's and were suffused with a scarlet light. It was demonic and terrifying\!

What was this?

Was it still a goat?

Or was it some special beast that deliberately let out the cry of a sheep?

Chu Xiaoye froze in place, feeling terrified.

This place was extremely strange, and he could not stay long\!

The injured cold father and the four female lions got up from the ground with sorry and terrified expressions.

They were completely stunned.

Chu Xiaoye felt a little guilty and hurriedly called for Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to protect them as they left.

He and Catherine protected them from behind.

When they walked out of the dark forest full of bones, they heaved a sigh of relief.

They did not dare to stop and quickened their steps towards the distant hill.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the corpses along the way and thought of the monster with only a pair of scarlet eyes just now. He felt even more uneasy and terrified.

Could these Maasai have been killed by that monster just now?

Or did that kind of monster live in groups, meaning there was more than one of them?

If that was the case, not only would the humans here suffer, the lions on the other side of the hill and all the creatures on the grassland would also be doomed\!

Something terrifying seemed to be quietly happening in this world.

Not long after they left.

In a dark corner of the mud hut where Chu Xiaoye was standing previously, a black shadow suddenly twitched and slowly got up from the ground.

It was thin and tall, wearing a tattered red shirt. It walked with its two legs, its body was bent, and its head was lowered. Its two arms were hanging and its body was stiff. It moved to the door step by step.

Under the dim moonlight, it revealed a rotten and terrifying face and a pair of scarlet and bloodthirsty eyes\!

"Roar —"

Suddenly, it raised its neck and let out a wild beast-like roar at the distant night. It was high and sharp\!

He was the leader of this tribe\!

At this moment, in front of the village, in the forest, on the grassland, the dried corpses lying on the ground trembled and slowly got up.

They lowered their heads and moved their feet stiffly, gathering towards the village with bloodshot eyes.

Then, they took advantage of the night and surged towards the next village.

On the other side of the hill.

The night was as black as ink.

The hungry lions continued to run for their lives.
