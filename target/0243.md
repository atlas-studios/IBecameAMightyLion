Chapter 243: Followers

They entered the tunnel.

Chu Xiaoye looked back and saw that the little white lion was still following behind.

Was she really stupid?

Could it be that she had to follow him back to the grassland?

Chu Xiaoye stopped and turned around to wait for her.

Tilly came to his side and looked at him in confusion. As if she suddenly did not know him again, she walked past him and walked to the front, leaving alone.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and looked at her back in a daze.

At this moment, Catherine, the mixed fur lion king, and the others caught up.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and was about to tell them that the little white lion was stupid when an anxious roar suddenly came from the tunnel behind.

Before long, the white lioness, Letty, chased after them with two strong figures.

They were two adult lions with gray fur and tall bodies. They were even larger than the mixed fur lion king.

They were the descendants of the lion of the grassland and Letty.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the two grayish-white lions that could already walk and were in high spirits. He was secretly excited. His saliva had really cured their illness.

Letty stopped in front of him with her two sons and looked at him gratefully. She whimpered, then turned around and roared at her two sons.

The Jerry brothers immediately walked in front of Chu Xiaoye, lowered their heads, and crawled on the ground to show their submission.

Chu Xiaoye saved their lives.

On the snow mountain, they could not survive anymore. The pride of Letty still chased after them.

Therefore, Letty decided to let them leave the snow mountain with their benefactor and return to the grassland.

Their father originally belonged there.

Letty walked close to Chu Xiaoye and licked his fur gratefully, begging him to let her two sons follow him.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the lion brothers and hesitated for a moment before nodding and agreeing.

He needed strong subordinates now. With these two strong lions with snow mountain bloodlines, the strength of the pride would naturally increase.

However, could they bear to let their mother go?

The Jerry brothers walked in front of Letty and rubbed her head and body affectionately and reluctantly.

Letty lowered her head, her eyes flickering with tears. She gently helped them tidy their messy fur.

They were already healthy and would soon become stronger.

All of this was thanks to this young lion king. Therefore, before coming, she had always instructed them to be loyal to this young king and not betray him.

Because he gave them new lives.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and waited for them in front.

The white lioness would not leave with him because the snow mountain was her home. Her pride, her sisters, and her family were there.

It was difficult to leave one's home, and it was the same for everyone.

Chu Xiaoye looked up at the front. The little white lion walked in front alone for a while before turning around and returning. It came in front of him and widened its eyes, staring at him in confusion, as if it suddenly thought of him and was a little uncertain.

Chu Xiaoye saw that she was quite pitiful and decided to help her recall.

"Bang\!"

He slapped her head and looked at her in anticipation.

"Do you remember?"

He had already slapped her many times and should have some memories.

"Roar\!"

Tilly suddenly cried out and pounced into his arms. She lowered her head and crawled under him vigorously. She started to drool again and looked like she was acting spoiled and hungry.

She wanted to drink milk again.

Chu Xiaoye kicked her and sent her to the ground. He sat on her face and spat out black smoke at her nose and mouth with a puff\!

This time, she should remember\!

He did not believe that his one and only super invincible fart in this world could not hook her memories\!

Howeverâ€¦

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

Not only did this little white lion not vomit in fear, it suddenly cried out in excitement. As it cried out, it greedily sucked in the black smoke. It was extremely excited, as if it was possessed by a fat little elephant girl\!

Chu Xiaoye froze in place, dumbfounded.

The black smoke dispersed.

Tilly looked at him with a burning gaze, looking like she wanted to continue.

Chu Xiaoye no longer suspected that the little white lion had really been knocked silly.

After saying goodbye to their mother, the Jerry brothers followed.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and immediately set off with the team.

Tilly followed beside him and rubbed against his body from time to time, as if she treated him as family.

Seeing that she was quite pitiful, Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to bully her anymore and let her be impudent.

After passing through a long tunnel, they arrived at the partition in the middle of the two tunnels again.

The left and right were covered in snow.

Chu Xiaoye felt hungry. Thinking that there was still a long distance to go, he could only bring the team to the snowy forest on the right and prepare to find some prey.

Now that there were many members and their appetite was astonishing, one or two prey was definitely not enough.

They split up and entered the snow forest to hunt.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine walked together while Tilly followed beside him.

The mixed fur lion king brought his three subordinates and the lioness named Lena along.

Blue the male leopard walked alone.

The Jerry brothers walked by themselves.

As for the two strong warthogs, they did not need to hunt. They only needed to dig the roots of plants in the snow forest.

They each ate the prey they caught. The teams that did not catch any prey could only starve.

Under such circumstances, Chu Xiaoye would definitely not pity them.

This was the most basic survival technique.

If they could not even fill their stomachs, what use were they to him?

What he needed were useful subordinates, not burdens.

The snow in the forest was very thick and it was extremely inconvenient to walk. His four legs were almost stuck inside.

It was not easy to catch prey.

However, they should all have their own methods. Otherwise, they could only wait for death.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Tilly into the depths of the snow forest.

Soon, they discovered a few strong yaks.

The fur of these yaks was extremely lush and almost reached their knees. Their bodies were covered in such long fur that they were extremely resistant to the cold. At the same time, be it their stamina or strength, they were extremely strong.

Of course, they were also very vigilant.

The ground was covered in a thick layer of snow. If Chu Xiaoye approached like this, he would definitely be discovered.

He decided to circle around the back and approach from the tree.

However, before he could move, Tilly, who was following beside him, suddenly roared and rushed over ferociously.

In the end, he had just run a few meters when he suddenly staggered and fell to the ground. His entire body was almost buried in the snow.

The yaks also fled in panic from fright. Soon, they ran into the forest and disappeared.

The corner of Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He hurriedly walked over and dug the little white lion out of the snow.

Tilly crawled into his arms and rubbed her head with all her might, crying out for milk.

Chu Xiaoye pressed her head with his claw and pressed her into the snow, making her unable to move. He sighed inwardly.

Beside him, Catherine looked at him gently and took the initiative to leave to find prey.

Tilly lay in the snow and struggled for a few times before stopping.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and ignored her. With a whoosh, he climbed up a big tree at the side and jumped between the trees.

When he jumped four to five trees and landed on the trunk of a big tree, he suddenly discovered a group of slender snow rabbits.

Although there was not much rabbit meat, it could fill one's stomach.

Just as he was about to move, he suddenly heard a warm breath. He turned around and saw that the little white lion was also lying on this tree beside him at some point in time\!

Tilly looked at him gently. She tilted her head and leaned against his neck with a loving expression.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to slap her away, he suddenly heard the panicked sounds of the snow rabbits running from below. He looked down and saw a huge snow rabbit pressing on a snow rabbit, biting its head\!

As for the huge snow rabbit, its eyes were blood red and two rows of sharp teeth grew out of its mouth. Its face was distorted and ferocious, and it did not look like a rabbit at all\!
