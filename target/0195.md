Chapter 195: The Leopard Sisters

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and flicked his claws.

If this young leopard dared to challenge his dignity as a lion king again, he did not mind using his golden claws to teach her how to be a qualified leopard\!

He was not a male leopard\!

Seeing that his expression was not good, Belia could only stop teasing him. She looked at him resentfully and continued to bare her teeth at the cute violent bear mother and son pair.

Belita quickly climbed up the tree. As she climbed, she turned around and roared at Chu Xiaoye.

It was as if she was saying, "The big smelly fart is here\! The big smelly fart is here\!"

After she climbed to the top of the tree, she lowered her head, bared her fangs, and roared at Chu Xiaoye with a fierce and disdainful look, as if she was saying, "Go away, don't come over\!"

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the tree and climbed up.

This little leopard was clearly itching for a beating. Otherwise, why would she deliberately provoke him?

Then, on the account that they had known each other for so long, he would fulfill her wish\!

"Roar… Roar…"

Seeing him quickly climb up the tree, Belita was immediately afraid. Her arrogance and disdain from before immediately disappeared. Her watery eyes looked at him pitifully, as if she was saying, "I was wrong. Don't come over…"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and passed by her, climbing onto her. Then, he rode on her and raised his claws, slapping her head.

"Bang bang bang bang bang\!"

He attacked left and right mercilessly\!

"Roar —"

Belita was furious\!

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her mouth again to make her behave.

Belita immediately lowered her head and whimpered, looking pitiful as she said, "I was wrong. Please spare me."

Seeing that she was admitting defeat, Chu Xiaoye stepped on her head and climbed down the tree.

Belita glared behind him and gritted her teeth in hatred, looking like she would never rest until he died.

When he landed on the ground and looked up, Belita instantly lowered her head and put on a terrified look that said, "I won't dare to do it again."

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to leave, Belia, who was under the tree, immediately bared her fangs and roared at him, as if she was also saying, "The big smelly fart is here\! The big smelly fart is here\! Scram, don't come over\!"

As she called out, she even pretended to retreat timidly. Her watery eyes were filled with anticipation as she looked at him.

She seemed to be urging, "Come and bully me\! Come and bully me\! Just like how you treated Belita, bully me fiercely\! Don't pity me\!"

However, Chu Xiaoye was not even interested in looking at her. He turned around and left.

Belia immediately trembled in anger.

As for fighting the panda and her son, she was immediately not in the mood.

She looked up at her younger sister, her eyes filled with jealousy.

This little girl from the countryside was more coquettish and knew how to tease. She wanted to play hard to get\! She was pretending to be cute and stupid\!

Hmph\!

Chu Xiaoye walked out of the bushes and saw Catherine lying in the grass in the distance. She was looking up at the starry sky silently. This posture continued for a long time, and no one knew what she was thinking.

When he walked close, the little lioness was still in a daze and was a little distracted. She did not sense his arrival.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze moved and he quietly moved behind her, wanting to test her reaction.

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly jumped onto her back, opened his mouth, and bit her neck.

Of course, his teeth only touched her skin and did not use much strength.

Catherine suddenly turned around and swung her sharp claws at his face. At the same time, she let out a terrifying roar and opened her mouth to bite\!

However, when she saw the figure in front of her and smelled a familiar scent, all her actions instantly froze.

Chu Xiaoye lay on her and looked at her with lingering fear.

If she had not stopped her claw just now, he was not confident enough of his ability to dodge it.

The female cub's speed was terrifying\!

Catherine lay on her back and looked at him in a daze. She raised her sharp claws stiffly and was about to touch his face.

Chu Xiaoye raised his right palm and flicked out his golden claws. He clashed with her claws and stood up with a smile in his eyes. He turned around and walked towards the blue-eyed lion king.

He did not know how the lion king was doing. If he could last until tomorrow, there was a high chance of him surviving.

When he walked to the side of the blue-eyed lion king, Catherine was still lying in place with her limbs in an attacking state. She was vertical, but she seemed to be petrified and did not move.

He had just… pressed against her body…

Chu Xiaoye circled the blue-eyed lion king and realized that it seemed to have lost the vigilance an animal should have. It was sleeping very soundly, but its breathing sounded very even. The wounds on its body were no longer bleeding. It seemed that the situation was not very bad.

His saliva seemed to have played a big role.

Not far away, many dark and gloomy eyes appeared.

Carnivores had a sharp nose. Even from afar, they could smell the blood here.

However, they paced around the border and clearly smelled the pungent smell left behind by the Chino brothers on the border.

Although those two fellows were very cowardly, they were still very useful.

At least their scent could save him a lot of trouble. Ordinary carnivores would run far away when they smelled an adult lion.

Chu Xiaoye stood beside the blue-eyed lion king and looked calmly at the group of timid wild dogs, like a king looking down at a peasant.

The current him was already a true lion king.

He had territory, subordinates, and female lions. He had everything he needed. He only lacked fame.

Of course, he was still lacking the majestic mane that every lion had to have.

That tuft of golden hair looked a little non-mainstream. It was too striking and conspicuous, and it did not match his reserved and low-profile personality.

He had always wanted to be a low-key and powerful lion king.

"Roar—"

He suddenly opened his mouth and roared at the group of wild dogs not far away. He said arrogantly and domineeringly, "Scram\! This is my territory, and you all dare to behave atrociously\!"

The wild dogs immediately dispersed and fled in panic.

The blue-eyed lion king beside him was shocked. It raised its head and looked at him in confusion.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and turned around to return to the bushes.

He suddenly forgot something.

He had not excreted feces and farted for many days.

He had to see if the impurities in his body had changed after evolution and the blood rain during this period of time.

Perhaps the stench would suddenly become fragrant.

When he walked into the bushes, the unwilling Belia immediately secretly followed behind and decided to continue attacking.
