Chapter 233: Evolving Again\!

"Roar —"

The white male tiger hesitated for a moment before its gaze turned cold and killing intent shot out. It roared and jumped up, attacking the little white lion\!

Of course he knew this little white lion\!

No matter what, he could not let her leave today. Otherwise, all his previous efforts would be wasted and no one would survive\!

The twenty giant fish immediately surrounded him and surged over\!

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately jumped down the tree, charging towards the group of giant monsters.

It was his duty to protect the grassland\!

"Bang\!"

The little white lion actually swung its claws and slapped the white male tiger head-on.

Chu Xiaoye had just run close when the little white lion flew out and landed in front of him. It staggered a few steps back and almost fell.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly pressed his head against her body and helped her steady her body.

Tilly turned and looked at him, her angry eyes filled with relief. She seemed satisfied that he did not escape alone.

She rushed up again.

As for the white male tiger, it rushed over with a murderous aura.

Both sides seemed to want to kill each other\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that there was also a tentacle shining slightly in the tentacle beside the white male tiger's mouth.

His heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Could it be that these shining things represented a certain animal's current strength?

The whiskers of lions were also called crystal whiskers. They were like the fingerprints of humans and were unique. Every one of them was different and could be used to identify lions.

Tigers should be similar.

Now, a faintly shining crystal whisker had appeared by the mouth of this little white lion and the white tiger. Perhaps it was related to the mutation and their own strength.

The female and male tigers he had seen previously did not have this characteristic.

And now, this male tiger was clearly much stronger.

The little white lion's strength also underwent a tremendous change.

A small circle of light also appeared on the tip of her rhinoceros' horn. Clearly, its strength could not be underestimated.

"Bang\!"

Tilly's claws collided with the white tiger's claws again.

This time, Tilly landed steadily on the ground.

As for the white male tiger, its body trembled and it took a few steps back.

Although the white male tiger was larger, the strength of both sides seemed to be equal.

"Roar —"

The white male tiger immediately roared angrily and pounced forward again.

Tina did not show any weakness and charged forward.

At this moment, the twenty giant fish quickly swayed their tails and crawled over.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately rushed up. Golden light flashed from his right claw and with a whoosh, he cut off the open upper jaw of a huge strange fish\!

When the other huge strange fish rushed up, he suddenly jumped up and landed on a big tree beside him. He used the tree trunk to jump out and landed behind a few huge strange fish.

Before the huge strange fish could turn around, he waved his two claws and cut open the backs of the two huge strange fish, then quickly retreated\!

The other giant fish immediately chased after him.

In order to prevent the sneak attack of these giant fish, Tilly jumped onto the tree and continued to fight the white male tiger.

The white tiger chased relentlessly and roared continuously.

Many trees were injured and their leaves rustled down. Some of the thinner trees were broken by his slap.

One tiger and one lion were chasing and fighting on the ground one moment, and were jumping around on the tree in another moment. In a moment, the surroundings were in a mess.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye brought the remaining ten-over giant fish to a hill a little far away.

The hill was steep and covered in snow.

The crawling movements of these giant fish immediately slowed down and their reaction speed was greatly reduced.

Chu Xiaoye waved his golden claws and started to massacre crazily.

Just as he killed until blood splashed and corpses were everywhere, another huge strange fish suddenly crawled out from the pit opened by the hundred-colored tiger.

This huge strange fish was larger and was about six to seven meters long. Its entire body was covered in black armor, and its tail was as hard and strong as an iron whip. With a random swing, it actually cracked the bark of a big tree and sent wood flying.

There was a thorn on its back that was emitting a weak light. It was quite similar to the light of the crystal whisker at the corner of the white tiger's mouth.

When it swayed its tail and charged aggressively at Chu Xiaoye, the remaining six to seven giant fish beside Chu Xiaoye immediately took the initiative to retreat. Clearly, they were very afraid of this larger fish.

Chu Xiaoye's claws were dyed with scarlet blood. He stood in the corpse of the strange fish and looked at the larger strange fish.

The flickering barbs seemed to be different from the others and looked even more ferocious.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this huge strange fish was the true enemy.

He did not wait for the other party to come over. Instead, he took the opportunity while the other party was climbing the hill to take the initiative to rush over. He jumped and his right claw flashed with golden light, grabbing fiercely at its head\!

Unexpectedly, the huge strange fish actually swung its tail and instantly turned around. Its black and thick tail swung at him at lightning speed with a whoosh\!

Chu Xiaoye was in midair and could not dodge in time. His right claw grabbed its tail fiercely, but his claw slipped and did not pierce into its muscles. His entire body was slapped by the steel-like tail with a bang and he flew out diagonally, landing heavily on the hill and rolling down.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye immediately felt a sharp pain in his chest. His vision turned black and he almost fainted\!

He stopped at the foot of the hill and struggled to get up. His chest was burning with pain and his bones were almost broken. He looked down and saw that a large patch of fur under his neck and chest had been torn off. The flesh was also badly mutilated and dripping with blood\!

This tail was actually so terrifying\!

"Whoosh—"

The huge strange fish shook its head and wagged its tail as it quickly jumped over\!

Chu Xiaoye stood at the foot of the hill and looked up at it. The strange heat in his abdomen surged up and started to heal his wounds, causing his pain to immediately decrease.

His claws started to burn.

The blood in his body seemed to be boiling as it flowed quickly\!

His entire body was filled with strength as he charged up again\!

"Whoosh\!"

The huge strange fish suddenly turned around again. Its tail was like a thick steel stick that brought with it the sound of wind as it lashed heavily at him\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily. The golden claw he raised suddenly flickered with a dazzling light. With a clang, it collided heavily with the thick tail\!

There were actually sparks\!

"Chi—"

Blood splashed\!

The tail of the huge strange fish was broken in the middle and cut off. It spun and flew out, landing on the snow not far away with a bang.

It was actually still beating\!

"Coo —"

A strange scream suddenly came from the throat of the huge strange fish\!

It hurriedly turned around, opened its bloody mouth, and pounced at Chu Xiaoye, who had fallen to the ground.

Chu Xiaoye jumped to the side and landed in front of the broken tail. His right claw flashed with golden light and cut the still swaying broken tail into two from the middle\!

Those black scales flickered with a metallic luster. When they collided with his golden claws just now, they actually flickered with sparks. Its hardness was obvious\!

Blood dyed his golden claws red, but they instantly disappeared, as if they had been absorbed by his golden claws.

Chu Xiaoye felt that the golden claws were hot and full of strength again\!

The huge strange fish dragged its broken tail, opened its mouth, and rushed over hysterically. Just as it was about seven to eight meters away from him, it suddenly jumped up and pounced at him crazily\!

The huge black body flew in midair. In its bloody mouth, its fangs were bared and its face was ferocious and distorted, like a ferocious monster that had fallen from the sky\!

However, the light of justice never disappeared\!

Chu Xiaoye did not dodge. With a whoosh, he rushed over and the golden claw he raised shone with a dazzling light again\!

Like a ray of golden sunlight, it streaked across the dark forest\!

Chu Xiaoye rushed over from under it at lightning speed.

"Bang\!"

The huge strange fish landed heavily on the ground. Its broken tail suddenly swayed and it turned around. Its bulging eyes stared at him coldly.

The snow on the ground instantly turned red.

It lay there motionless.

The blood on Chu Xiaoye's golden claws gradually disappeared.

He stood in place and looked at it coldly.

About a minute later, Chu Xiaoye walked over. With a whoosh, he suddenly grabbed its head. Sparks flashed and only a layer of scales was scratched off\!

The huge strange fish lay on the ground with its eyes wide open and did not react.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the scratch on its head and then at the shining barb.

At this moment, the light on the barb was gradually extinguishing.

Chu Xiaoye walked to its side and used his claws to open its body.

Blood surged out\!

Its abdomen had long been cut open and its internal organs and blood were piled on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered and he placed his claws in the pool of blood.

However, there was no reaction at this moment.

The claws were no longer absorbing the blood.

It seemed that it was only useful in battle.

"Roar —"

The furious roar of the white male tiger came from the forest.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He hurriedly got up and ran over.

At this moment, the remaining seven giant fish seemed to have sensed that something was wrong and were scattering.

Chu Xiaoye could not care less about the little white lion. He immediately chased after the hungry giant strange fish with his fastest speed and continued to kill them.

The strength of those giant fish was almost incomparable to the previous one. They could not resist his golden claws at all.

In a moment, they were all killed by him.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye ran towards the place where the little white lion and the white tiger were fighting.

The pain in his neck and chest seemed to have disappeared.

He looked down and saw that the badly mutilated place had started to scab. Golden fur quietly crawled out like sprouts from the soil.
