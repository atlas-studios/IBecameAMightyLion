Chapter 179: The Invading Ancient Lizard

"Croak —"

Above him, the cry of a crow could be heard.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the Baobab tree to sleep. When he opened his eyes, it was already evening.

No one knew if the little white lion had left after being beaten up.

As for the Chino brothers, because they had seen something they should not have seen, they were still soaking in the mud and thinking about it.

On the distant grassland, cows and horses were in groups and the sun was setting.

Peace had returned to the bushes.

The carnivores left with their round stomachs. The flesh on the grass had been cleared and not even bones were left.

Chu Xiaoye stood up and looked at the zebras on the grassland.

He was hungry.

As a king, he had to hunt personally. Just the thought of it was a little sad.

When could he be like the blue-eyed lion king and have a group of loyal female lions that could fight well?

Obviously, he still had to wait.

At least until he grew a mane and became a true lion.

After all, the female lions needed more than a lion king that could protect them and defend their territory.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the tree and walked out of the bushes.

The Chino brothers hurriedly got up from the mudhole, wagged their tails, and came behind him in a fawning manner.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at them and then at the zebras on the distant grassland.

The two brothers immediately understood.

In order to show their loyalty and usefulness in front of their boss, they ran out with a whoosh and rushed bravely towards the zebras.

In the end.

Before they could rush close, the zebras saw them. They raised their hooves and ran away calmly.

The Chino brothers were furious. They immediately roared and chased after him.

In the end, not only did these two roars scare the zebras away faster, even the black antelopes not far away immediately fled after hearing the news.

Chu Xiaoye's mouth twitched. He really could not complain and could only do it himself.

He did not know how these two idiots survived until now. They did not even know how to hunt. They did not move, but their voices were heard first. They directly alarmed the enemy. Wasn't this stupid\!

Forget about them.

If they could not catch prey, they would starve.

From today onwards, even if he could not finish all the prey he caught, he would never leave them any\!

Hunger would teach them how to be a qualified carnivore\!

On the grassland near the border.

The water buffaloes were still eating the grass leisurely.

Their bodies were huge and strong, and there were two sharp horns on their heads. They were in groups and were not afraid of the carnivores on the grassland.

Forget about one lion, even if there were four or five, as long as they were not sick, injured, or lost their team, they would not care at all.

The water buffaloes here were like other animals, larger and stronger than their own kind on the grassland over there.

Furthermore, they were even more united.

If Chu Xiaoye wanted to kill a water buffalo alone, there would be no problem. He was only afraid that if he killed one, the other water buffaloes would all rush over angrily.

With the water buffaloes' hooves and strong bodies, if they ran and collided in groups, they would be like a majestic beast pack. No matter how strong you were, you could only escape.

Otherwise, you could only be reduced to meat paste.

There were no trees or mud pits on the grassland. They were like an invincible army of cavalry. When they ran with all their might, even an elephant herd had to retreat.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye's hunt this time was clearly a little challenging.

He liked challenging actions.

Otherwise, life would be boring.

He did not deliberately hide and walked towards the water buffaloes.

The water buffalo, who was standing at the periphery, looked at him and mooed, as if it was reminding its other companions.

The water buffaloes raised their heads and looked at him, then behind him and in other directions.

When they confirmed that he was the only lion, their vigilant expressions immediately relaxed and they continued to lower their heads to eat the grass.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the water buffalo guarding at the outermost corner.

He walked over.

The water buffalo looked at him and was not afraid. Instead, it was a little angry and immediately ran over.

Under normal circumstances, even a pride that had come to hunt would flee in all directions in fear when they encountered such a barbaric charge. They did not dare to stay in place.

However, when it ferociously rushed close, it realized that this cub was still standing there. It did not escape or dodge. It was like a fool.

The water buffalo did not hesitate and immediately lowered its head. It raised its sharp horns and charged forward ferociously\!

When it was about to charge close aggressively, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and jumped onto its back. His right claw flashed with golden light and pierced into its back with a whoosh, pulling hard\!

"Chi—"

His sharp right claw cut open its flesh and revealed its ribs\!

"Moo—"

At this moment, the rash water buffalo let out a miserable scream and fled in fear.

He rushed towards the herd and let out a painful wail, wanting to seek help.

However, Chu Xiaoye grabbed its butt again\!

The intense pain made it moo as it ran crazily.

The other water buffaloes immediately dodged in fright when they saw him like this, not daring to approach.

This water buffalo jumped and jumped, looking terrified and at a loss, but it could not throw Chu Xiaoye off its back.

Seeing that it was about to run out of the borders of the territory, Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate anymore and suddenly pierced his claw into the abdomen on his side. With a whoosh, he cut open its stomach\!

"Bang\!"

The intense pain made the water buffalo's limbs go limp and it fell to the ground. It let out a painful roar and could not stand up again.

Blood instantly dyed the grass red and his internal organs started to flow out.

At this moment, the water buffaloes rushed over with a murderous aura under the lead of the water buffalo leader.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the water buffalo's back, turned around, and ran out along the border.

The water buffaloes chased angrily from behind.

However, although their iron hooves were rolling and their formation was strong, how could they catch up to Chu Xiaoye, who was running as if he was flying?

Soon, Chu Xiaoye fled without a trace.

The water buffaloes gave up on chasing and returned to the water buffalo that was still crying out miserably. They looked at it for a while before leaving one after another and continuing to return to their original place to eat grass.

Chu Xiaoye drank a few mouthfuls of water by the river in the distance before walking back slowly.

That water buffalo clearly could not survive.

The water buffaloes were different from an elephant herd. They could not always guard their companions. Their feelings for their companions were not as deep and long-lasting as that of an elephant herd.

As long as it was an injured water buffalo, even if it could survive today, it would definitely not survive until tomorrow.

They might be very united with their healthy and strong companions, but they could only abandon their injured and weak companions.

They had to walk a long distance to look for food every day. They could not implicate the entire tribe for a companion.

When Chu Xiaoye walked over, the water buffaloes had already left far away.

However, there was an unexpected group of guests beside the water buffalo that was still roaring in pain.

They were a group of large lizards dripping with saliva.

Some were like Komodo Dragons, but the armor on their backs was stronger and the teeth in their mouths looked sharper.

Their skin was green and they were about three meters long. They looked even larger and more ferocious than the Komodo Dragon.

There were a total of five.

When Chu Xiaoye ran over, they were already wolfing down the water buffalo.

The water buffalo still did not stop breathing, but it was also on the verge of death.

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared angrily and pounced at one of the giant lizards\!

These bastards were actually so arrogant\!

It was bad enough that they trespassed his territory, but they actually dared to snatch his prey\!

He had hunted this water buffalo with great difficulty\!

Just as he was about to pounce on the giant lizard, the giant lizard suddenly swung its thick tail and whipped his head with a whoosh\!

Its actions were fierce and ruthless\!

Chu Xiaoye was furious. His right claw flashed with golden light and collided with its tail with a "chi"\!

Blood shot out\!

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground, his right arm feeling a little numb.

As for the giant lizard's tail, it was dripping with blood, revealing the bones inside\!

It did not break\!

Chu Xiaoye was a little surprised.

Not only was this giant lizard exceptionally strong, its skin and bones were also exceptionally hard\!

His golden claws were invincible and could even crush the lion's skull. Now, when he swung his claws down, he did not manage to catch this giant lizard's tail. This shocked him greatly\!

"Sss —"

The giant lizard whose tail was scratched by him immediately jumped up, turned around, and opened its mouth at him, revealing two rows of sharp fangs and the smelly liquid in its mouth\!

Those scarlet tongues were covered in sharp thorns\!

The other four giant lizards immediately stopped fighting for food and crawled over, letting out threatening sounds.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned to see their appearance.

For some reason, when he saw the appearance of the five giant lizards, he suddenly thought of the huge dinosaur skeleton he saw at the bottom of the lake at the edge of the forest that day.

Be it crocodiles or giant lizards, they should be animals left behind from the dinosaur era.

This basin was adjacent to the sea. There were no signs of humans, and there were probably many ancient creatures living here. Just like these giant lizards, they had never appeared in the vision of humans.

Chu Xiaoye knew how lethal the Komodo Dragons were, but he did not understand these green lizards.

He wondered if the strange heat in his body could still detoxify him after they bit him.

Perhaps, these giant lizards were more poisonous and had more bacteria in their mouths. Perhaps their bite strength was even more terrifying than that of crocodiles.

Therefore, when the five giant lizards opened their mouths and pounced on him, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to take them head-on and immediately retreated to dodge.

These five giant lizards were not too fast and did not seem to be interested in him. After chasing him away from the water buffalo, they immediately turned around and returned to continue eating.

The water buffaloes' corpses were covered in their saliva.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he could no longer swallow this water buffalo.

However, he could not tolerate this.

This was his territory\!

And this water buffalo was also the prey he had painstakingly caught\!

He could not watch helplessly as this group of bandits ate his prey in his territory\!

He walked up again.

This time, the five giant lizards immediately turned their heads and opened their mouths, looking at him fiercely.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up. His right claw flashed with golden light and grabbed the tail of the previous giant lizard\!

The tail of the giant lizard was originally dripping with blood and its bones were exposed. Now, it was grabbed by his golden claw again. With a crack, blood sprayed and it was broken\!

"Sss —"

This giant lizard was shocked and furious. It immediately turned around and pounced at him crazily.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and ran\!

After chasing for a few meters, the giant lizard rolled in place in pain and let out painful cries.

The other four giant lizards immediately chased after him angrily.

Chu Xiaoye lured them away. Then, he suddenly turned around and jumped over their heads, charging towards the giant lizard that was rolling on the ground in pain again\!

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed\!

Chu Xiaoye's golden claw pierced into its flesh along its broken tail. Then, he suddenly slashed forward and instantly split its entire back into two\!

Blood sprayed and its flesh was flipped open, revealing the dense white bones on his back\!

Before it could turn around and bite, Chu Xiaoye had already jumped into the distance and walked in front of the water buffalo's corpse. He looked provocatively at the other four giant lizards.

The giant lizard that had its back cut open immediately cried out in pain and rolled violently on the grass. The blood flowing out of its back and broken tail instantly dyed a large patch of the grass red.

Obviously, it was going to die here today.

The other four giant lizards crawled in front of it and spat out scarlet tongues. No one knew if they were sad or angry.

Chu Xiaoye stood beside the water buffalo's corpse and growled, looking like he was urging them to come and die.

The four giant lizards were furious. They immediately shook their heads and wagged their tails as they rushed over.

Right at this moment, a loud and clear cry suddenly came from above\!

When the four giant lizards heard this cry, for some reason, they suddenly stopped in place and raised their heads, not moving.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he raised his head and looked up.

Under the blue sky, a snow-white goshawk was spreading its wings and circling in the sky. Its sharp gaze looked down at the entire land like God.

"Boom\!"

Right at this moment, the ground suddenly trembled\!

Not far away, the low roars of a lion, the cries of hyenas, the long cries of a wolf pack, and the cries of all sorts of animals suddenly came, as if they were responding to something.

On the grassland, a black herd of water buffaloes, zebras, antelopes, and so on suddenly appeared and ran towards the distant majestic snow mountain\!

The bright sky was suddenly covered by a black flock of birds\!

All sorts of birds formed groups and flew towards the snow mountain\!

The four giant lizards that were stiff in front of Chu Xiaoye immediately shook their heads and swayed their tails as they left quickly.

The animals in the entire grassland seemed to be moving.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned in place. He was at a loss and did not know what was happening.
