Chapter 499: Elven Prince

"Lanisi is back."

In the sky, the fiery red pterodactyl swooped down and arrived in the blink of an eye.

An intense wind assaulted her and her silver hair fluttered. The crown on her head also swayed.

However, her eyes were filled with admiration.

This was her eldest daughter, Princess Lanisi, who was only 17 years old.

No one in the entire Elf City did not know of Lanisi's battle results and courage.

"She's a natural warrior\!"

This was the queen's most satisfied evaluation of her.

A fiery red pterodactyl streaked across the front of the luxuriously decorated stone house and turned to the sky. A tall girl in fiery red armor had already jumped down agilely and stood in front of the Queen.

She was different from her mother or most elves.

She had fiery red long hair and a determined expression. Her narrow blue eyes naturally revealed a dignified and wild aura. Even when she saw her mother, she only nodded calmly and did not look at the Queen for a second.

She held the sword hilt at her waist with her right hand and swept the stone house with dignity. When she saw the two lions, she frowned slightly.

Then, she looked at the arena below.

The queen shrugged and turned to grin at Denise. "See, my precious daughter is going to be unhappy again."

Denise lowered her head and did not react.

This was the effect the Queen wanted.

The princess looked at the arena where the servants were wiping the blood and finally said, "The elves are in danger. Mother, do you still want to do this?"

The Queen turned to look at Denise and smiled. "See? I knew that this would be her first sentence."

The princess stopped talking.

Soon, Prince William walked over with his guards and smiled warmly. "Lanisi\! My dear sister\! You're finally back\! I was so worried about you while you were out."

Princess Lanisi only turned to look at him and did not have the intention to make small talk.

Prince William was not embarrassed. He walked in front of the Queen and knelt on one knee. He kissed the Queen's hand and pretended to be wronged. "Mother, look. My dear sister is still cold to me. Did I do something wrong?"

The Queen raised her head and rubbed his head, her eyes filled with love. She smiled and said, "She likes to do what servants should do. She can't be persuaded."

Prince William got up and sat down properly beside her. He sighed and said, "Yes, it's a subordinate's business to investigate the movements of the orc army. Sister Lanisi always likes to snatch jobs from them. What's the use of those scouts?"

The Queen curled her lips and did not continue.

The stone house immediately fell silent, and the atmosphere became a little awkward.

Prince William suddenly turned his head and grinned at Vilis. "Lady Vilis, I have a suggestion. You have two lions, one lion, and one lioness. Then, can you let the two of them go down to the arena to compete?"

Vilis narrowed her eyes and did not answer.

Prince William rubbed the gem ring on his thumb and paused for a moment. Then, he smiled and said, "Let the two of them die. Those who survive can not only become my mount gloriously, but also obtain my highest reward."

At this point, the corner of his mouth suddenly curled up and a strange smile appeared on his slightly mature face. "I can reward the orc slaves to the winner to enjoy, or human slaves, or even my elven concubines. Lady Vilis, what do you think? Of course, you can also obtain rewards."

Vilis clenched her fists and still did not speak.

Just as Prince William was about to continue provoking her, Lanisi suddenly reprimanded coldly, "Enough\!"

The smile on Prince William's face immediately disappeared.

He turned around and looked at his sister, a fierce light flashing in his eyes. He said coldly, "Lanisi, I'm not talking to you. Furthermore, you have to remember that I'm the crown prince and the next king of the elves\! From now on, you should learn how to respect and serve me, not target me everywhere\!"

He looked at his mother again and immediately recovered a warm smile. "Am I right, mother?"

The Queen smiled and said, "Of course."

Lanisi stopped talking and continued to look at the arena below, not moving.

Before long, the members of the royal family and the invited ministers were all here.

Viscount Lori hung a sword on her waist and leaned on her walking stick. She stood behind the Queen with Viscount Boren.

He looked at Wei Lisi and smiled at the Queen. "Your Majesty, Lady Vilis looks very unhappy."

The queen seemed to have realized something and turned to look at Vilis with a smile. "Oh, is that so?"

Viscount Lori smiled and said, "It seems that Lady Vilis can't bear to let the two lions go down to fight."

Vilis suddenly said, "Yes, I can't bear to\!"

Viscount Lori was stunned. She did not expect her to still dare to say this in front of the Queen at this time.

The Queen frowned and the smile on her face disappeared.

Viscount Boren started to use strength in his grip on the sword hilt and looked at the bold girl sharply.

Vilis suddenly looked at the queen and said, "Your Majesty, what Princess Lanisi said previously was also in my heart. The elves are already in danger, and the enemy is at the door. Do you still have the mood to watch these programs? As our king, are you really thinking for the elves?"

"Impudent\!"

Viscount Boren roared and pulled out the sword at his waist, glaring.

The atmosphere suddenly became tense.

The corner of Viscount Lori's mouth revealed a victorious smile.

Prince William suddenly stood up, clapped his hands, and smiled. "Everyone is here. This is not the time to quarrel. Isn't that a waste of time?"

He suddenly raised his voice and looked around. "I suggest that we let the two lions beside Lady Vilis fight in this first match\! A lion versus a lioness, haha. Perhaps they might suddenly be interested in fighting and perform a show of mating animals for us on the spot\!"

"Hahahahaâ€¦"

"The prince is right\!"

"I agree very much\!"

Unbridled laughter and excited jeers came from the surrounding stone houses and the seats below.

Even the Queen laughed and said half reproachfully and lovingly, "Look at this child. He's only thirteen years old."

"Yeah, he's only thirteen."

Right at this moment, a discordant voice suddenly came from the corner of the stone house.

This voice was unfamiliar and sounded very stiff.

The Queen looked over in surprise.

Prince William also looked down.

"Whoosh\!"

A figure suddenly rushed out and pounced at Prince William\!

Golden light flashed and blood splashed\!

Prince William's head, which was still smiling teasingly, flew out of his neck and out of the stone house, flying into the air of the arena with a splash of blood.

Then, under the excited gazes of many people waiting to see the wild beasts fight, he landed vertically.

"He's only thirteen. What a pity."

The killer landed on the stone table full of sweets and sighed softly.
