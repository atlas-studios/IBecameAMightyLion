Chapter 274: Does It Feel Good?

After dark.

The pride dispersed and returned to their respective homes.

After running around and fighting for a few days, they were already exhausted.

After eating and drinking their fill, they lay down and slept the moment they returned.

Chu Xiaoye also climbed up the tree and prepared to rest.

Catherine was still lying in the bushes under the tree, looking up at him quietly like every night before.

A white figure suddenly blocked her vision and blocked him.

Tilly climbed up the tree and lay face to face with Chu Xiaoye. She looked at him with her charming sapphire eyes and smiled.

"Does it feel good?"

"After sitting on the throne and facing the admiration and respect of so many lions, smelly fart king, do you feel good?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her, closed his eyes, and ignored her.

Tilly extended her snow-white claws and slapped his head rudely, insisting that he answer. Otherwise, she would pester him endlessly.

Chu Xiaoye yawned and opened his eyes, looking at her calmly.

"If you think that being a king is for pleasure, girl, your childishness and ignorance have exceeded my imagination."

Tilly blinked and grinned.

"Could it be that being a king is not used to feel good? Why do I feel that being a king is used to feel good? For example, after becoming a king, you can obtain a lot of benefits. You can order them to be your slaves, have priority in eating, and obtain territory. Furthermore, you can also have priority in obtaining the right to mate. In fact, you can even choose all sorts of beautiful female lions from all the prides. The old, the young, the thin, and the fat will be your harem. Isn't this good enough for a lion?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her strangely, as if he was looking at a precocious idiot.

He did not answer and closed his eyes again.

He did not want to talk to an idiot.

An idiot like her would never understand what responsibility, honor, righteousness, and glory were.

Of course, he did not understand.

However, this was probably what he had to do now and in the future.

After all, these made his blood boil and he found the meaning of life and existence again.

As for the benefits, rights, and female lions that this little idiot mentioned, to be honest, he was not interested.

He had seen these things when he was a human. Now that he was a lion, he did not want to fall into that old trap again and be unable to free himself.

Some things could not be quit after being stained. If they were stuck in it, they could not get up.

He only hoped to live brilliantly, but he did not like to live too tired and meaningless.

"Smelly fart king, you might not understand how satisfying these things are now, but after you slowly taste the sweetness, you will start to chase after them with all your heart. At that time, you will discover that it's getting more and more satisfying and you can't stop. In the end, you won't be the one who starts to change."

Tilly looked at him with a burning gaze, but there was ridicule and sadness in the depths of her eyes. She seemed to be talking to him or talking to herself.

"Furthermore, at that time, you will slowly forget the companions beside you and all the companions who will accompany you down the path. In fact, you will even turn your former trust and feelings into vigilance and burdens. You will gradually dislike them, dislike them, and abandon them. You might even kill them."

Tilly looked at him with a complicated gaze, but she did not focus, as if she was talking to another him.

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a moment before nodding, indicating that he should thank her for her reminder. He would be vigilant.

He did not expect this little white lion to be so emotional.

This was not something a lion could think of. Even humans might not be able to think of it in advance. Even if they could think of it in advance, they would definitely not be able to do so.

Power was even more terrifying than a ferocious beast. It was indeed difficult to grasp.

If one grasped it well, they could benefit the world and shine forever. If one did not, they would bring disaster to the world, fall into the mud, and become infamous for ten thousand years.

If he, the king, had his own ambition, then this group of followers, who had placed all their hope and trust in him, would immediately become his tools.

He would never care about their survival again.

Therefore, the little white lion's reminder was not without reason.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and looked at Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the members of the pride of the cold father under the tree.

If he was not him in the future, his family would be in danger.

"I have a way to get you out of these troubles. I can make you never be afraid of yourself again and become someone you don't even know."

Tilly looked at him with a burning gaze and a sincere expression.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and waited for her answer.

Tilly extended her snow-white claws again and patted his head gently. The corner of her mouth split open.

"Give me the throne and let me bear the weight of the crown. Let me help you bear the pain in the future\! For you, I, Tilly, am willing to give up everything\!"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her and told her to scram.

Tilly covered her head and sighed.

"I knew that you could not bear to let go of this throne. I knew that you had already started to change. You have already tasted the sweetness. Your heart has already started to change slowly. Soon, you will show your hidden fangs and start to hurt your companions without restraint. You will start to show off your strength without restraint and start to shamelessly force the female lions to mate\! I knew it\!"

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped her again and told her to scram.

Not only did Tilly not scram, she suddenly leaned forward and placed her head on his head, telling him to not move and to see if his body reacted.

"Pfftâ€”"

A black smoke suddenly sprayed out and instantly covered their heads and bodies.

Under the tree.

Catherine raised her head and did not move. She looked at them silently like a piece of wood. Her dark eyes trembled like the flowers that trembled in the night wind.

To Chu Xiaoye's surprise, the sound of vomiting did not come first.

This little white lion was still holding his head and lying quietly in front of him. It did not flee from this super smelly fart.

It seemed that this little white lion's genes were too strong and it was already immune to his farts.

He shrank his head back, raised his claws, and slapped her, telling her to stop making trouble.

However, the other party did not have any reaction.

When the black fog dispersed, he realized that the little white lion had already rolled its eyes and stuck out its tongue. It had fainted.
