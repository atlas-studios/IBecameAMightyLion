Chapter 286: The Black Lion Army

"Roar—"

A roar suddenly sounded in the night\!

The moment the cold father was pushed to the ground by the black shadow, he tried his best to let out an emergency and angry roar.

This roar suddenly broke the silence of the night and woke up the elderly lions closest to him.

"Roar—"

Hence, roars rose and fell, and the alarms went higher and higher.

The ten-over old lions immediately roared and ran over.

The cold father's neck was bitten by the strong black shadow.

However, because the mane on his neck was too lush, the other party's sharp teeth did not bite too deeply.

He immediately roared and counterattacked. He swung his sharp claws and turned around to bite, looking like he was going all out.

He finally saw the appearance of this black shadow.

This was a strong black lioness\!

When the cold father saw that the attacker was actually a female lion, he immediately felt extremely humiliated, shocked, and angry. He suddenly roared angrily and actually broke free of the other party's sharp teeth and bit at the other party's head\!

The wound on his neck did not seem to affect his ferocity and strength at all.

Seeing how fierce he was, the black female lion hurriedly jumped away to dodge.

At this moment, the elderly lions were roaring as they ran over. They still looked majestic and aggressive\!

Seeing that she was outnumbered, the black female lion immediately turned around and ran towards her companions on the hill.

Seeing that their tracks had been exposed, the black female lions stopped hiding and immediately roared as they rushed towards the black lions.

They had gone against the current and sneaked over from the river to enter the back of this team and create chaos and panic for them, so that the black lions gathered in front could take the opportunity to attack.

According to the intel from a few days ago, was this area near the river not a public area and not guarded by any pride?

That was why they chose to shore here.

Unexpectedly, a group of lions was still stationed here, which was beyond their expectations\!

The female lions were puzzled, but they did not have the time to think. Seeing the lions charging over angrily, they could only muster their courage and face them.

"Roar—"

Under the lead of the cold father, the group of old lions regained their dominance and roared as they pounced into the black female lions.

Although they were old and weak, deaf and blind, and did not have their usual strength and agility, they were still lions\!

This was their new home and their new territory. They would never allow any invader to come and be impudent\!

"Roar—"

More than ten old lions shared a common enemy and fought bravely, never retreating\!

More than twenty agile female lions were blocked by this group of crazy lions that had risked their lives to fight. They could not take another step forward.

Neither side came to help.

In front of this large territory, in the territory where the pride of the cold father was stationed, all the lions rushed over one after another and quickly gathered together, following the young king and charging towards the black lion army.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye had already rushed into the black lion army with the members of the cold father's pride. He started to rampage and break the formation.

This time, there were more than two hundred black lions in the black lion army. They were all strong lions.

From the looks of it, it should be one of the main forces of the Black Lion Army. They were preparing to kill their team that was hiding in this corner tonight\!

Chu Xiaoye could not understand. With the size and strength of the Black Lion Army, what forced them to leave the former grassland?

Other than humans, there was probably no animal tribe that had this strength, right?

To catch thieves, first catch the king\!

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Tilly and suddenly turned around and rushed towards the tall black lion leader at the back of the black lion army.

However, there was no lack of powerful black lions in the black lion army this time.

"Bang\!"

A black shadow suddenly rushed out of the pride. Like a rash and strong rhinoceros, it suddenly hit him with its head and sent him flying.

Just as he landed on the ground, the black lions around him pounced on him.

Catherine flew over to save him, but her face was covered in blood from being grabbed by a few strong black lions.

Tilly's snow-white fur was also dyed red with blood.

The resistance ahead was too great. Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Tilly along and could not take another step forward.

Behind them, Little Curly Tail and the others were also separated by the other black lions and could not rush over to support them.

The prides distributed in various territories rushed over one after another and fought bravely under the lead of Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and other lions. However, they could not break through the outer circle of these black lions.

The members of the pride of the cold father entered alone and were surrounded in the middle of the Black Lion Army.

They originally wanted to do what they did at the previous battle and forcefully break the other party's formation, charging towards the other party's leader and completely disrupting the other party's fighting spirit. However, when they came in, they realized that this group of black lions was even more brave and strong. A few of them could even slap Little Curly Tail and Catherine away.

They could not take another step forward\!

Chu Xiaoye saw that the wounds on Catherine and Tilly were increasing and the resistance in front of them was becoming greater and greater. He immediately roared angrily and led them to retreat, meeting up with Little Curly Tail and the others.

The plan to kill the black lion leader completely failed.

He only hoped to bring Little Curly Tail, his mother, and the others away from the black wave safely and join the team behind.

After the battle just now, he already knew in his heart that their team was no match for this Black Lion Army at all. They could only fight and retreat to prevent being surrounded and catch them in one fell swoop.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Golden light flickered and blood splashed\!

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and Tilly out of the encirclement and joined Little Curly Tail and the others.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were injured.

Molly was also covered in blood.

The female lions were also covered in wounds.

This group of black lions was too strong\!

Chu Xiaoye stopped hesitating and made a prompt decision to retreat with them.

Looking at his mother's limping and miserable appearance covered in blood, Chu Xiaoye's heart ached. He suddenly roared angrily and jumped up. He crushed the head of the black lion blocking the way with his claw. Then, his claw pierced into his bones, picked up his strong body, and threw him out fiercely.

"Bang\!"

The group of lions in front of him was immediately knocked to the ground.

When Little Curly Tail saw this scene, he immediately roared angrily. He curled his tail and wrapped it around the neck of a black lion. Then, he swung it above his head and started to spin, swinging it crazily\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Little Curly Tail landed at the back and swung the black lion crazily with his tail. The black lions following behind were smashed until their bones broke and they fell to the ground. Some were sent flying.

As for the black lion that he had wrapped around its neck and swung away, it did not die. It only felt dizzy and could not tell north from south. It could only use its claws to obstruct crazily and bite randomly, scaring his companions away from approaching.

Chu Xiaoye and Tilly used their golden claws to open the way while Little Curly Tail used his tail to cover the retreat. Mei Mei and Molly were on the left and Catherine was on the right.

As for the four female lions, they were in the middle and could help any side.

Everyone worked together and fought and retreated. They finally broke out of the encirclement of the black lion army and gathered with One-Eye, Lars, and the others.

Blue Eyes and the other six tall lions were also injured by the powerful combat strength and numbers of these black lions.

Now, in their team, there were only more than 100 lions who could fight, including Chu Xiaoye and the others.

In the short confrontation just now, more than twenty had fallen in pools of blood.

The female lions and young cubs at the back were already terrified and helpless. They could only gather and retreat towards the forest at the back.

When they took a step back, the female lions and young cubs took a step back, feeling even more terrified and desperate.

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that if he did not retreat, the less than 100 remaining warriors would be slaughtered.

When they fell, the female lions, young cubs, and the elderly lions behind them would also be doomed. None of them would survive\!

Therefore, he immediately ordered a retreat.

During the battle, he brought the members of the pride of the cold father and rushed at the front.

When retreating, they were at the back.

This was his responsibility.

The black lions surged over like a tide.

Chu Xiaoye let Lars leave with the four female lions and the team behind him. As for him, he brought Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, and the others, as well as the six lions including Blue-Eyes, to stay behind to stop the enemy and buy time for them.

Their ferocity and strength successfully attracted the black lions.

Under the roar of the black lion leader, all the black lions pounced at them.

Lars and One-eyed brought the team and quickly retreated, letting out anxious roars and letting the female lions and young cubs behind quickly retreat into the forest.

When they were about to approach the forest, they suddenly realized that many old and even disabled lions ignored their orders and actually ran towards the river.

By the river, the roars of battle could be heard.

Lars and One-eyed were stunned for a moment, but they did not dare to hesitate. They immediately brought the team and continued to retreat into the forest at the back.

Seeing that they had gone far, Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and let the Blue-Eyes and the rest retreat quickly.

He brought Little Curly Tail and the others and continued fighting.

The Jerry brothers refused to leave. When they saw the bushes behind them, they immediately understood and hurriedly followed Blue-Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Chino brothers.

It seemed that if they stayed, they would definitely be a burden to the king.

When the black lion army was aggressive and was about to surround Chu Xiaoye and the others, Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and rushed towards the bushes.

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and followed closely.

Catherine, Tilly, and Molly also turned around and fled.

Soon, they rushed into the bushes and agilely climbed up the tree.

The black lion army roared as they came\!

Chu Xiaoye jumped quickly between the trees. When he jumped into the orchard, he stopped at the top of a fruit tree with dense leaves and fruits and hid himself.

The other members all hid.

The black lions charged into the bushes aggressively like a wave.

Tilly could not hide her snow-white fur and immediately played the role of prey. She deliberately swayed on the short tree, causing the black lions to surround her and roar angrily.

When the black lions surrounded her, she suddenly jumped up and jumped onto another short tree. She deliberately lay at the lowest point and let them think that they had a chance to catch her.

This group of black lions immediately ran around the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye lay at the top of the fruit tree and looked coldly at the black lion leader outside the bushes through the gaps in the leaves.

They had to find a chance to kill this black lion leader\!

Tilly attracted many black lions and ran around the bushes.

Mei Mei also revealed her figure and attracted another horse.

Blue Eyes and the others ran even further.

"Roar—"

An angry roar sounded outside the bushes.

The black lion leader soon realized their trick and immediately ordered the team to continue forward to chase after the fleeing lions.

The black lions immediately abandoned Tilly and Mei Mei and gathered together, continuing to chase after Blue Eyes and the others.

The black lion leader followed at the back and entered the bushes, wanting to pass through the bushes like his pride.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye and the others were already waiting\!
