Chapter 449: Untitled

Of course, Chu Xiaoye did not know how to lick it.

However, he still had to help. After all, he was the one who caused it.

Chu Xiaoye grabbed some mud at the bottom of the river with his claws and smeared it on the fur covered in mucus. He rubbed it hard for a while and washed the mucus off.

Alisa stood there motionless, looking at him sideways. He could not tell if she was angry or enjoying it.

When Chu Xiaoye retracted his claws and stopped washing, she still stood there motionless. She narrowed her eyes and stared blankly. She looked a little distracted, and her entire body seemed to be fixed.

Chu Xiaoye quietly retreated, then jumped up with a whoosh.

However, before he could jump out of the water, his tail hurt suddenly. He looked back and saw Alisa biting his tail, looking at him coldly.

Chu Xiaoye was dragged back to the bottom of the river.

Alisa let go of her mouth and moved her body. She looked at him sideways and told him, "Continue."

"Continue?"

The mucus on her body was clearly already clean. Why did he have to continue?

Alisa said clearly, "It's not clean yet. Continue\!"

Alright, Chu Xiaoye felt that this female cub was definitely addicted to massaging.

So be it. Anyway, he would not be at a disadvantage.

Chu Xiaoye grabbed a handful of mud at the bottom of the river again and smeared it on her fur, starting to rub it hard.

Alisa stood there motionless, her face expressionless.

Chu Xiaoye grabbed a handful of mud and smeared it on her head, starting to rub it.

Gradually, Alisa narrowed her eyes. The tail behind her butt started to sway unconsciously, and her head started to rub against his feet.

This mud bath and massage was not something an inexperienced lioness could resist.

Soon, her body turned limp and she slowly lay on the ground. She closed her eyes and was so comfortable that she was about to fall asleep.

Chu Xiaoye smeared mud all over her body and turned her into a mud lion. Only when she was sleepy from the massage did he quietly retreat and float up alone.

When Chu Xiaoye popped his head out of the water, he saw a few pairs of widened eyes staring at him curiously.

"Brother\! Brother\! How is it? Did you succeed?"

Mei Mei asked excitedly about the outcome she wanted.

Little Curly Tail also swung his tail and jumped a few times. He said excitedly, "Has Brother finally eaten that annoying lioness cub? Is there not even bone left? Brother is mighty\! Brother is domineering\! A lioness is the most annoying. She should be eaten\!"

Beside him, Molly secretly glanced at him with disdain.

Hypocritical fellow\! Who bullied her every night in high spirits\!

Catherine also stood by the river, her eyes filled with anticipation and anxiety.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them. After climbing ashore, he shook the water stains on his fur and walked towards the super huge tree. He looked up and saw that the thick tree trunk was covered in thick mucus. Many greedy insects were trapped on it and turned into empty shells.

The self-protection skill of this super huge tree clearly exceeded the scope of plants.

Chu Xiaoye returned to the space at the bottom of the giant tree and saw that the human girl was trying to climb up a thick root, as if she wanted to climb up the root and see the two natural caves above.

To her, who did not have the strength to protect herself, staying in the two high and hidden caves above was definitely the safest.

However, she did not have sharp claws or agile skills. How could it be easy to enter and exit this tree hole that was more than three meters tall?

Even with the help of the big black bear, it was very dangerous.

Her small arms and legs could not help but fall.

At this moment, the big black bear was standing under the tree root with a resentful but loving expression, being the little girl's ladder.

He did not want the little girl to climb up.

Because if the little girl climbed up and slept and played in the tree hole above, she would be too far away from him.

However, looking at the little girl's trembling appearance and her bright eyes filled with anticipation, it hoped that the little girl could climb up quickly.

The little girl's embrace could not hug the thick tree trunk, so it looked dangerous.

When she saw Chu Xiaoye return, she immediately tilted her head and looked at the young lion king for help. She begged pitifully, "King, can you live up there with Annie?"

There were two meanings to this sentence. First, he hoped that she could help him and allow him to stay there. Second, he hoped that he could bring her up every night if he lived with her.

If Chu Xiaoye agreed, all the little girl's problems would be resolved.

She did not need to climb and could live in the spacious tree hole above. There was also free lion fur to warm her and the lion king to protect her. Furthermore, she would become the most special existence in the pride because of the lion king's status.

Most importantly, not only could this young lion king understand her human language, it could also communicate with her without obstruction. It could even use its claws to write.

She yearned to have such happiness on this grassland full of wild beasts.

Unfortunately, Chu Xiaoye did not let her achieve her wish.

Although she was hugging the tree trunk and hanging on it, looking very dangerous, although she was wearing a beautiful white dress, white socks, and white leather shoes, had beautiful golden hair, and a pair of charming blue eyes that even revealed a pitiful and pitiful expression, Chu Xiaoye did not look at her again and left.

The little girl looked down at his retreating figure and sniffed, looking very sad.

The big black bear turned its head and bared its fangs, looking very angry. "Such a cute little loli and such a delicious little request. How can you bear to refuse\!"

Chu Xiaoye walked out of the cave under the giant tree. He searched the surroundings for a while and chose two trees with appropriate thickness. He used his claws to cut the ground and trimmed them carefully.

After the two tree trunks were trimmed relatively smooth, he used his claws to open a row of holes on one side of the two tree trunks. Then, he trimmed a few thick pieces of wood and lined the two tree trunks together. Then, he used brute force to insert the two ends of the wooden pieces tightly into the holes.

He was busy here. Alisa, who was at the bottom of the river, finally surfaced, but she was covered in mud and did not look like a lion.

Little Curly Tail and the others by the river had already left.

Alisa floated quietly on the water and let the river water wash the mud on her fur, but there was no anger or humiliation on her face. Her gaze was still blank, as if she had lost her soul and was thinking about something.

After a long time, she suddenly woke up and quickly splashed in the water. After washing the mud on her body, she jumped ashore and bared her fangs. She roared angrily in her heart, "I, Alisa, will never surrender\!"

In the evening.

The golden sun finally shone on the bushes.

A ray of sunlight also shone into the dark space under the tree, bringing light and warmth to this underground world.

The little girl, who was sitting on the ground with a dejected expression, turned around and looked at the sun. She was stunned for a while before getting up and walking into the sun. She bathed in this rare warmth and light, and her sad heart was filled with hope.

"Annie will definitely be able to do it\!"

The little girl clenched her small fists and secretly cheered herself on. Then, she turned around and walked towards the thick root again.

Suddenly, she was stunned.

She widened her eyes and looked at the simple ladder leaning on the tree root. Her eyes became brighter and brighter, and the expression on her face gradually turned from shock to surprise. Her wide eyes gradually curved.

"Oh\! God\! Is this a ladder?"

The little girl could not believe it, but the truth was in front of her.

She suddenly screamed, opened her arms, and ran towards Chu Xiaoye, who was walking out. She suddenly jumped up and rode on Chu Xiaoye's back. She hugged his neck and started to kiss his head and golden mane fiercely. She shouted excitedly, "King\! I love you\! I love you to death\!"

The big black bear at the side shed sour tears.

The other members who were resting widened their eyes in shock when they saw this scene.

This little thing was so brave\! She actually dared to ride on the king and bite him. Fortunately, her teeth were only for decoration. Otherwise, she would definitely have eaten the king's meat\!

She was courting death\!

Everyone was furious. They felt that in the next second, the king would jump up and tear this little thing into pieces\!

Little Curly Tail was furious. He swung his tail and quickly rushed over, roaring angrily, "Bastard\! Let go of my brother\!"

Then, he swung his tail and slapped it hard.

Unexpectedly, right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye suddenly used his strength and sent the little girl on his back flying.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail's iron tail slapped Chu Xiaoye's back fiercely, leaving a trail of blood.

"..."

The entire place was silent.

Little Curly Tail froze in place, raised his tail high, and widened his eyes. He did not move, as if he was petrified.

Chu Xiaoye slowly turned around and looked at him coldly.

Not far away, Molly was gloating, feeling uneasy, and extremely conflicted.

The little girl knew that she had gotten into trouble. She immediately lowered her head and quietly crawled away from the ground, praying that everyone would not look over.

When she climbed under the ladder, she finally could not help but stand up. She started to climb the ladder excitedly and quickly climbed up.

When she tiptoed and was about to crawl into a tree hole above, the leather shoes under her feet suddenly slipped and she fell from above with a whoosh.

Before she could scream, her body quickly landed on the ground. With a bang, she fell on Chu Xiaoye's head\!

Chu Xiaoye was caught off guard. He lowered his head and his entire mouth hit the ground heavily, covering his mouth in mud.

"Whoosh—"

Taking this opportunity, Little Curly Tail turned around and ran\!

The little girl rode on Chu Xiaoye's head in a daze, her eyes wide open and her face stiff. Her big blue eyes rolled a few times before she suddenly rolled her eyes and fainted.

"If he fainted, he should not be beaten up…"
