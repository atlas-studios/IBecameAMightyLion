Chapter 296: Mosquito at Night

"Bang\!"

However, just as the lioness pounced in front of Chu Xiaoye, she was slapped away by Chu Xiaoye, who was already prepared.

In this pride, Chu Xiaoye was not the tallest, nor did he show any kingly aura, nor was he surrounded and worshipped by the other members.

However, as soon as they met, this lioness and her daughter prostrated on the ground before him with their heads lowered.

They should have known long ago that he was the king here, right?

Furthermore.

Weren't they very hungry?

If they were really so hungry, the hyena Catherine killed should have been eaten by them long ago, right?

Lions usually did not eat the corpses of hyenas.

However, the prerequisite was that they had to have eaten their fill.

When lions were hungry to a certain extent, they would snatch food even if it was rotten meat full of maggots, let alone the corpses of hyenas.

As for this mother-daughter pair, they were very strange.

They were so hungry that they could not even stand steadily. Furthermore, they were still hesitating when they saw the fresh meat in front of them in front of everyone.

Obviously, they were pretending.

Of course, Catherine must have discovered something else by attacking so decisively.

For example, the abdomen of this mother-daughter pair was black.

Chu Xiaoye slapped the big lioness away and looked at the corpse of the female cub on the ground.

The female cub's abdomen was completely exposed. Under the blood, the brown fur near her abdomen actually turned black.

In other words, they were a black lion and her daughter.

The intelligence and courage of the black pride to be able to dye their black fur brown and sneak in so boldly made Chu Xiaoye look at them in a different light.

"Roarâ€”"

The female lion jumped up from the ground and turned to escape.

However, at this moment, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the others had already reacted.

They immediately surrounded her.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine pounced on her and pushed her to the ground. Her silver claws suddenly pierced into her abdomen and she opened her stomach with a whoosh\!

The female cub's movements were ferocious and her gaze was fierce. She was merciless\!

The cold father beside him immediately trembled when he saw this.

The female lion let out a few miserable cries and died with her eyes wide open.

Until this moment, Little Curly Tail and the others still did not know what was happening.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the female lion, extended his claws, and smeared blood on her abdomen. Then, he pressed her tail into the grass and rubbed it.

A moment later, the brown tail turned black.

The cold father stood at the side in a daze. Like the other members, he was dumbfounded when he saw this scene.

It turned out that this lioness and her daughter were actually two black lions\!

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, asking them to drag the two corpses away.

Over this period of time, new members joined every day.

They had discovered these two spies, but what if there were other spies?

He could not check them one by one.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei left with a corpse in each of their mouths. Molly followed behind with the hyena's corpse in her mouth.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of Catherine, raised his claws, and rubbed her head to show his appreciation.

Catherine lowered her head, and the coldness in her eyes instantly turned into gentleness.

Tilly stood in the forest not far away and watched this scene. She could not help but roll her eyes and turn to leave.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked at the distant night. He felt that he should still exercise the rights and responsibility of a lion king and check all the prides in the territory.

Of course, in order to take care of the feelings of the prides and not let them feel wronged and suspected, he could only roughly check with his gaze or ask One-eyed, Lars, and the others in private to see if there were any abnormalities in the behavior of those members recently.

He had to patrol often.

Even if he could not find out, he could deter those spies with ulterior motives. Furthermore, he could make the pride not forget him as a king after not seeing him for a long time.

Every small territory had a lion patrolling it.

He could not patrol every territory personally. He only needed to walk around the outermost border.

He was the king of this territory, so he had enough reason to walk around.

For example, he had to mark the borders.

No one dared to overstep their bounds in this matter. Only he could.

At the thought of this, he no longer delayed and decided to start tonight, starting from his territory.

If he wanted to do it, he had to do it completely. He could not arouse suspicion.

He growled and called for Catherine, walking towards the distant border.

Just as he was peeing at the border, Tilly and the Belita sisters followed him.

Tilly followed behind him and mimicked his comical actions of peeing. She grinned and let out a mocking roar.

Belia twisted her butt and jumped around him charmingly. She even deliberately aimed her butt at him and curled her tail high.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and called Lars and One-eyed over with a roar, asking them to inform the prides of each territory in advance. He wanted to mark the territory and take a look at them. At that time, he hoped that they would all appear.

At the same time, he reminded Lars and One-eyed to pay attention to the members of every pride who had recently been acting strangely.

Lars and One-eyed accepted the order and left.

Only then did Tilly know that he had something to do. Marking the territory was probably just a pretense. Of course, she could not rule out his vanity.

Which lion king did not want to leave their scent at the edge of their territory?

Tilly followed behind. Her light blue eyes turned around and she also secretly started to pee.

Catherine looked at her and did not expose her.

At the same time.

On a grassland near the foot of the mountain.

A group of female lions were hunting and a group of young cubs were playing in the bushes under the watch of a few female lions.

At the distant border, a few lions were patrolling the territory.

One of the lions looked a little tired. It lay down on the grass at the border and continuously let out hoarse roars to warn the nearby enemies.

Because their territory was closest to the mountain range in the innermost area, most of the enemies came from the forest at the back.

Some wandering lions, spotted hyenas, and so on in the forest would often sneak into their territory to hunt. Therefore, they had to be vigilant of these invaders at all times.

This lion roared for a while before feeling tired. It narrowed its eyes and started to sleep.

At this moment, he suddenly heard a buzzing sound.

It seemed that a mosquito had flown over.

The lion swung its tail and wanted to chase it away, but the buzzing suddenly stopped in his ears.

"Buzz â€”"

Suddenly, more buzzing sounds came.

The lion opened its eyes and turned its head to look behind it.

A black cloud enveloped over\!
