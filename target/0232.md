Chapter 232: Spy

"Roarâ€”"

Tilly roared angrily, but she still did not jump down from his back.

She reached out with her claws and placed them on his eyes, glaring at him angrily with a fierce expression. "If you don't let go, I'll blind you."

Chu Xiaoye loosened his teeth and continued to run.

He seemed to have only used this threatening ability to poke the eyes with his claws on the little white tiger.

This was really a cycle of karma and retribution.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye saw a big tree with lush leaves and snow all over it. He jumped up and decisively carried the little white lion up. He quickly climbed to the top and hid behind the dense tree trunk.

The snow eagle flew overhead.

On the ground, the ten-over rhinoceroses ran past with a murderous aura.

They did not discover them.

He finally dodged these terrifying pursuers.

Now, it was time to settle scores with this little white lion\!

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye flicked his golden claw and turned his head to look at the lioness cub on his back. His gaze was cold as he prepared to let her roll down and fight.

However, the little white lion's longer golden claws were already on his neck and head.

With a light slash, it would shatter like the thick layer of ice from before and become a big hole.

Chu Xiaoye did not doubt the sharpness of these two golden claws and the speed of this female cub.

Therefore, he grinned and raised his golden claw to collide gently with hers, as if he was a good brother who was going to exchange fists to express his friendly feelings.

Tilly looked at him teasingly and grinned as well. She even stuck out her tongue to lick his head and said, "Kid, as long as you're obedient, we're good brothers. If you're disobedient, you'll immediately become my blind brother. Damn brother\!"

Chu Xiaoye calmly retracted his gaze and looked under the tree.

The rhinoceroses had already run far away and the greatest threat had been eliminated.

This female cub was now a lone lion. Although she was quite strong, her intelligence was definitely not as high as his. He had plenty of ways to make her kneel down and call him daddy\!

He lowered his head and prepared to carry her down.

At this moment, Tilly suddenly bit his ear and gestured for him to stop.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to flare up, he suddenly realized that a tall white male tiger walked out of the forest not far away.

As the male tiger walked, it looked around and looked around warily.

Then, he stopped under a big tree at the side and pricked up his ears to listen to the surroundings. His sharp and cold gaze swept around again and again.

The appearance of this white male tiger here meant that it was clearly a tribe member of the white tiger mother and daughter pair.

However, this should be the territory of the female tiger, Dora. Why was he here?

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree, feeling puzzled. He did not dare to move again.

This white male tiger was tall and stronger than the two previous male tigers that had trespassed here. Clearly, it was not an ordinary person.

He did not want to provoke trouble again.

Tilly still bit his ear and stared at the white male tiger with a burning gaze. Her expression was different, and she seemed to know this white male tiger.

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and wanted her to let go.

However, Tilly seemed to have forgotten his existence and ignored him.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to fart silently, the teeth that were biting his ear suddenly tightened.

Tilly's body also started to stiffen. She had clearly seen something unbelievable.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before looking down.

The white male tiger suddenly raised its claws and knocked on the ground under the tree a few times. It listened for a while and then started to dig the snow and mud on the ground with its claws.

Could it be that his feces were also very smelly and he was preparing to dig holes to poop?

Chu Xiaoye guessed.

"Whoosh\!"

A small pit suddenly collapsed on the ground.

Then, a white water pillar shot out like a fountain.

The white male tiger immediately took a few steps back, raised its head, and continued to look around vigilantly.

The water pillar only sprayed for a few seconds before stopping.

The white male tiger raised its claws and slapped the ground heavily a few times, as if it was sending a signal.

Before long, a figure covered in scales like a crocodile crawled out of the pit.

The figure was huge and was at least five meters long. It had a thick tail behind it and sharp claws on its limbs. The two rows of teeth in its mouth were as sharp as blades\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled as he looked at the familiar figure in shock.

It was the sea monster fish he had killed on that island\!

However, this strange fish was larger and looked even more ferocious\!

Why was this thing here?

It was a mutated sea creature, an invasive species that the snow mountains had to kill\!

At this moment, when the huge strange fish crawled out of the pit, the head of another strange fish popped out\!

Then, a second giant fish climbed up.

Then, a third, fourth, and more giant strange fish crawled out of the pit endlessly.

Chu Xiaoye's body was tense, and his heart was filled with shock and fear.

Could that male tiger be a spy?

If these giant strange fish were allowed to appear here, the animals on the snow mountain would probably not be able to sense them. At that time, the army guarding the ocean border would be attacked from both sides and suffer heavy casualties\!

The female cub on his back was trembling. He did not know if it was fear or anger.

A total of twenty giant fish crawled out of the pit.

They were clearly the vanguard. They came out to scout the way and observed the situation here.

In the deep pit, it was very likely a tunnel that led to a certain place. There were even more giant strange fish hiding in it, and there were even other mutated marine creatures.

How did they hide in there without anyone noticing?

Clearly, that white tiger knew the answer.

If that white tiger was a spy, there would definitely be other accomplices and they would be at the borders of the sea. Otherwise, these marine creatures would not have the chance to enter the passageway from the sea.

At the thought of this, Chu Xiaoye became anxious.

Not only for the snow mountains, but also for the grassland.

If the snow mountain fell, the grassland would never have peace again.

All the animals on this land would be doomed\!

He could not let the twenty giant fish leave the forest alive\!

Otherwise, once they reached the icy plains outside, they could dig a hole and enter the river under the ice. At that time, it would be difficult to find them.

As for them, they could jump out and attack the animals here at any time. Furthermore, they might use their skills to contact their own kind in the sea to convey the situation of the defense here.

These twenty giant strange fish were definitely a disaster for the snow mountain\!

Of course, there was also the white tiger that helped others and the other spies\!

"Whoosh\!"

Before Chu Xiaoye could move, the little white lion riding on his back suddenly jumped up and ran for a distance on the branch. It jumped up and landed on another tree like a goshawk flapping its wings\!

She chased after the group of giant fish\!

At the same time, she suddenly let out a loud and ear-piercing roar that did not seem to be the roar of a lion.

This roar immediately spread throughout the forest and rushed into the sky\!

The white male tiger and the twenty giant fish on the ground were shocked and looked up.

"Whoosh\!"

Tilly jumped down from the tree and pounced ferociously at the huge white tiger. She looked extremely furious\!

When the white male tiger saw her appearance, it was shocked and its eyes were filled with fear.
