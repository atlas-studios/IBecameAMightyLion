Chapter 289: The Pride of the Cold Father

They won.

However, this sudden victory was unexpected.

No one knew why the elderly lions suddenly radiated the heroic aura of kings when they were young.

Their courage, their fearlessness, and their determination to die made all the members of this team feel shocked and in disbelief.

The prides that had once chased them away were even more unbelievable.

The old lions, who could not even catch prey and had difficulty running, were brave and fierce like a lion king that had just become an adult at that moment. Their auras were incomparable\!

The heroes who had been defeated by time and returned as kings again stunned all the young lions who had mocked them for being old.

Victory belonged to them.

They belonged to these brave and powerful lions that were already old\!

The black lion army collapsed\!

Out of the more than 200 black lions, only a few dozen escaped.

The green grass was dyed red with scarlet blood. Looking across, it was dark and their corpses were everywhere.

The cold father returned gloriously with the elderly lions and their bodies covered in blood.

There were no flowers, applause, praise, or rewards. However, when they faced the gazes of the pride that had once chased them away, they no longer had their initial timidity and inferiority.

They used their lives to save this team.

On the hill by the river, the corpses of the black female lions lay. The corpses of old lions lay there as well.

The blood of the enemy and theirs flowed on the grass here.

Out of the more than 100 old lions, there were only more than twenty left.

They were riddled with wounds and covered in blood. They still walked slowly and looked old. However, at this moment, no one would look down on and dislike them.

They released their last light, dispersed the darkness on the grassland, and lit up the hope of this team again.

They were heroes.

Even in their twilight years, they were still great\!

The entire team quietened down and took the initiative to open a path. They watched as they slowly left and returned to their lonely territory.

Earth would still spin no matter what.

However, no one in this world was unnecessary.

Every life had its meaning and deserved to be respected.

Although former heroes had lost to heartless time and reality, they were still worthy of respect, learning, and forgiveness.

Chu Xiaoye gave these old lions an independent territory and a home where they did not have to wander around. He only hoped that they could spend the remaining time well. However, he never would have thought that they would give him such a big surprise.

He only hoped that after this matter, the other members could tolerate these old lions and let them live here in peace.

He did not need help. As long as he did not bully them, he would be tolerant.

The fittest survived. Those who aged should make way for the young. However, everyone would grow old. He only hoped they would be a little more tolerant when there was enough food and everyone could survive.

Chu Xiaoye knew that the rules of nature that had survived until now would never be changed easily because of this battle.

But the world is changing.

The animals were mutating, the plants were lush, there was more food, and the environment changed. Perhaps some things would change too.

Wasn't this how humans were?

Looking at the old lions gradually walking further and further away, Chu Xiaoye sincerely hoped that they could live well and use the remaining time to watch the world change.

Tonight's victory would usher in a stable period for them.

Even if the more than 200 black lions were not all the strength of those black lions, their strength would definitely be greatly reduced.

They were definitely not the only ones who could resist on this vast grassland.

If there was pressure, there would be resistance.

There were probably prides all over the grassland fighting for their homes and lives.

Therefore, the black lions probably did not have the energy and strength to deal with them in a short time. Only by destroying the small forces in other places could they gather their troops and attack again.

After all, they had complained about their failures in the past few battles. Clearly, the strength here could not be underestimated. They had to gather their full strength in order to win.

Tonight's victory also let Chu Xiaoye's team see more hope.

In the joy of victory, they started to disperse.

The corpse of the black lion on the ground was left in place. Tomorrow, animals and birds would naturally come and clean it for free.

Some members who were not picky about food started eating.

Under the cold father's lead, the group of old lions started to wolf down the corpses of the black lions on the grass by the river.

If these corpses did not decay too quickly, they would be enough for these old lions to eat for a while.

However, it was difficult to say in this weather.

The cold father took a few bites and felt that it was difficult to swallow. He looked up and saw that everyone was eating happily. He could only continue to lower his head and lick it, pretending to eat again.

Suddenly, he thought of the food that his unfilial son had saved on the tree.

If not for those food, the members of their pride would have starved to death during the previous dry season.

The food was dry and there was no water. Even in the hot dry season, it was still preserved perfectly. There was no stench of decay. How did it survive?

If he learned this method, he could completely preserve the corpses of the black lions he killed tonight. This way, these old and weak lions that could not hunt would no longer be afraid of hunger.

At the thought of this, he immediately became excited.

"Roar\!"

He growled and told his old companions that they could eat slowly. He had to go home to see his wife and son and teach them.

He left quickly, feeling more and more excited the more he thought about it. His steps became faster and faster, and in the end, he started running.

He seemed to see the black mass of corpses turn into a large pile of delicious food that was piled in the middle of the territory. Those elderly lions would wake up every day and open their mouths to eat. They would no longer have to run around and worry about filling their stomachs.

He seemed to see those former lion kings all looking at him with admiration and gratitude, willing to treat him as their boss\!

"Roarâ€”"

He was extremely excited and ran as if he was flying.

Little Curly Tail, who was patrolling at the borders of the territory, was about to praise him for his courage tonight when he saw him suddenly jump over his head and continue to run as if he was flying.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment and was furious. He immediately turned around and chased after her, preparing to question her angrily.

Unexpectedly, the cold father suddenly turned his head and looked at him angrily, taking the lead to question him.

"Unfilial son\! Are you not convinced? If I did not take the lead to charge and kill the enemy tonight, you would have died long ago\!"
