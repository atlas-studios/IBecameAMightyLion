Chapter 378: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and the lion's head landed\!

Belita, who had been pushed to the ground, was stunned for a moment before she hurriedly crawled out from under the headless corpse. Her face was covered in blood and she looked rather sorry.

Chu Xiaoye instantly killed this lion. Just as he was about to continue killing, the group of angry water buffaloes had already surged over with iron hooves and a murderous aura.

The neat and uniform sharp horns, the strong hooves, and the ferocious and terrifying impact all displayed their incomparable lethality\!

Although Chu Xiaoye was furious, he did not dare to risk the lives of the other members. He immediately roared angrily and retreated with the team.

The group of invaders did not dare to hesitate and immediately fled in another direction.

Chu Xiaoye looked back. There were not many invaders. There were five lions and three female lions in total, and they were all tall and strong.

Two of the lions were as big as Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur. When they ran, they were calm and did not panic at all. They even turned around and looked at them coldly.

Obviously, the other party would not let this matter rest.

As for the two water buffaloes' corpses, the other party clearly would not give up easily.

Indeed, when the water buffaloes stopped chasing, the group of invaders immediately stopped running and turned around, looking at them coldly.

Chu Xiaoye also stopped with the team and turned to look at them.

Both sides looked at each other and sparks flew. They were furious.

The two largest lions bared their fangs and let out arrogant roars. They even deliberately raised their hind legs and peed on this territory that did not belong to them.

This was a brazen and unrestrained provocation\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail roared angrily and swung his tail. He could not help but rush up.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with a cold light. He turned around and looked at the water buffaloes not far away.

The water buffaloes were not in a hurry to eat grass. They were still in neat rows and aggressive, preparing to charge at any time. Furthermore, they surrounded the two water buffaloes' corpses in the middle.

Originally, Mei Mei and the others were about to bring away the two water buffaloes' corpses, but they were destroyed by that group of despicable invaders. Furthermore, at that time, Mei Mei, who was transporting the corpses unguarded, was even scratched by the other party's lion. At this moment, the flesh on her back was blurry and dripping with blood.

How could he not take revenge?

However, before the water buffaloes calmed down, he was not prepared to act rashly.

The water buffaloes were huge and strong. They looked very united and shared a common enemy, but they did not have much patience.

The pride had absolute patience.

The three sides faced each other.

The dark grassland was silent.

However, less than ten minutes after guarding the corpses of their companions, a water buffalo could not resist the temptation of the grass and started to lower its head to eat the grass, gradually leaving the team.

The other water buffaloes followed suit and started to disperse, taking the time to eat the grass.

Soon, the water buffaloes ate the grass on the ground and gradually walked further away, towards a place where the grass was even more lush.

On the grass, the corpses of the two water buffaloes reappeared in the vision of the pride.

The invading pride did not hesitate and walked towards the two water buffaloes' corpses, as if they ignored Chu Xiaoye's pride that had absolute sovereignty over this territory.

This arrogant and fearless attitude immediately made Chu Xiaoye's team furious.

"Roar—"

Mixed Fur roared and requested to fight\!

Little Curly Tail wagged his tail and looked at his brother impatiently.

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with a cold light, but he was not in a hurry to charge over. Instead, when the invading pride was about to reach the two water buffaloes' corpses, he brought the team and blocked all the other party's retreat.

"Roar—"

The invaders' pride turned around and leaned against the two water buffaloes' corpses, showing their sharp fangs and ferocious faces.

The three female lions actually walked in front of the two water buffaloes and lay there, preparing to eat.

They had invaded their territory, ambushed them halfway, and snatched their prey. Now, they actually wanted to eat in front of them. How much did they look down on their pride\!

Chu Xiaoye raised his tail.

"Roar—"

With a roar, Mixed Fur pounced forward first.

Blue Eyes, Little Curly Tail, Catherine, Mei Mei, the Jerry brothers, and the leopard family of four roared and rushed up.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place alone and did not follow. Instead, he stared at one of the female lions with a burning gaze.

The female lion's fur was gray and she was not much different from the other female lions on this grassland, but her eyes were especially different.

In the night, the light flickering in those eyes had a faint scarlet color and looked rather familiar.

Chu Xiaoye had seen such scarlet eyes more than once.

"Bang\!"

Mixed Fur slapped one of the lions to the ground and bit its neck.

The blue eyes also beat the other strong lion back in panic.

The other two lions did not have much combat strength and were pushed to the ground by Catherine, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the Jerry brothers.

They seemed to have been hungry for a long time. Their stomachs were empty and they did not have any strength.

The five lions fell to the ground in the blink of an eye, some dead and some injured. As for the two female lions, they ignored them and continued to eat the water buffalo.

After the mixed fur bit the lion to death, it immediately jumped up and pounced at the two female lions.

He was not a lion that cherished women\!

Just as he thought that these two female lions were like hungry ghosts that had been reincarnated and could not resist at all, one of the female lions suddenly jumped up and slapped him on the face, sending his 500-kilogram body flying\!

This slap not only stunned mixed fur, but also frightened Blue Eyes, Little Curly Tail, and the others.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye finally confirmed the true king of this pride and immediately rushed up.

After the lioness slapped away the mixed fur, she jumped towards the closest Little Curly Tail with a whoosh\!

Little Curly Tail was biting one of the lions. Seeing this, he was not anxious and swung his tail fiercely.

This iron tail was not simple. It could even crack rocks. If it slapped him, at least his flesh and bones would be blurred\!

However, the female lion was not afraid at all and did not dodge or retreat. She raised her claws and pounced forward. With a whoosh, she actually cut Little Curly Tail's iron tail into two\!

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail, who was feeling pleased with himself, immediately let out a miserable roar and jumped up from the ground.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He had already pounced close and suddenly grabbed at the female lion. However, he saw the female lion's figure flash and quickly retreat. She looked at him with scarlet and cold eyes and actually turned to escape.

As for the other lioness, she had already been torn to pieces by the Jerry brothers\!

Everyone looked up and was shocked to discover that the terrifying lioness charged straight at the water buffaloes eating grass\!
