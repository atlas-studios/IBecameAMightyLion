Chapter 173: Golden Claw Rebirth (3)

"Whoosh\!"

The vegetation swayed and the pride came searching.

Chu Xiaoye curled up and hid on the dense branches and leaves. His dark and cold gaze looked at the pride below through the gaps in the leaves.

It was already late at night.

The moonlight was bright and the sky was filled with stars.

This was supposed to be a quiet and beautiful night.

Now, it was filled with blood and killing intent.

Under the lead of the blue-eyed lion king, the pride searched every patch of grass angrily.

The female lions at the back were clearly frightened by the previous terrifying sneak attacks. They stayed close to each other and did not dare to be too dispersed. They were always vigilant of the dense grass and bushes, afraid that the little lion would suddenly pounce out again.

The blue-eyed lion king looked up at the surrounding trees as it searched the ground.

Those blue eyes flickered with a dark and demonic cold light in the night.

Just as he walked under the tree that Chu Xiaoye was hiding under and was about to look up to search, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up from the tree and flew over his head. He was like a meteor that streaked across the night sky and instantly flew seven to eight meters away, landing on a female lion at the back\!

The female lion watched helplessly as he flew over and could not react in time\!

"Bam\!"

She was pushed to the ground and her throat was bitten\!

Chu Xiaoye did not stop at all. He picked her up in his mouth and left quickly\!

Even though he was biting a strong adult lioness, his running and jumping speed were still light and not affected.

When the blue-eyed lion king brought the pride and turned around angrily to chase after him, he could no longer be seen.

"Whoosh\!"

In a patch of dense grass, a waterhole full of mud was hidden.

A thick layer of fallen leaves floated above the waterhole.

At this moment, water splashed everywhere. Chu Xiaoye dragged the lioness's corpse and jumped in, disappearing instantly.

The rippling water quickly returned to calm.

The fallen leaves floating on the water quickly closed and covered the entire water.

Because it had just rained, the bushes were full of water pits and mud. After a chase, the forest was also filled with the scent of lions, Chu Xiaoye, and the strong smell of blood. Therefore, it was impossible to find his traces with his scent.

Soon.

The blue-eyed lion king brought the pride and chased angrily into the forest.

The blue-eyed lion king's gaze had been searching the tree.

The other members searched the ground.

A strong lion with a black mane walked into the grass and stopped in front of the waterhole.

As there were many water pits in the forest, most of them only extended their claws to probe. If they felt that it was suspicious, they would wait in front of the waterhole for a while.

After all, lions were land animals and could not stay in the water for too long.

This black-haired lion seemed to have smelled something. It immediately extended its claws, pushed aside the fallen leaves on the water, and stuck its claws in.

Suddenly, he felt his claws touch something soft\!

He was shocked. Just as he was about to roar, the soft thing suddenly floated up along his claws and revealed the water.

It was the lioness that had been abducted previously\!

The female lion had already died and become a corpse\!

The black-haired lion was shocked and furious. It turned around and wanted to report to the lion king, who had already gone far away.

Right at this moment, under the corpse of the female lion in the water, a head suddenly popped out with a whoosh and bit its mouth. With a whoosh, it dragged him into the waterhole\!

Before he could roar, his entire body had already sunk into the water\!

This waterhole was actually two meters deep\!

The black-haired lion was terrified. It struggled at the bottom of the water, but its mouth was bitten and its entire head was pressed tightly into the mud at the bottom of the pit\!

If he was on the shore, with his strength, he would never be suppressed like this\!

However, he was underwater now. He was terrified and flustered. Soon, he choked on a lot of mud from his nose. The strength in his body was suddenly at a loss. He did not know where to go and only cared about bouncing his limbs and struggling in fear. His mind was already blank\!

Soon, he suffocated to death.

The commotion here did not seem to attract the attention of the other lions.

The splashing sounds were also completely covered by the roar of the lion in front of the bushes.

The blue-eyed lion king and the pride focused on the front.

Because the roars ahead were endless, they seemed to have discovered something.

They ran over quickly and realized that their companions were surrounding a big tree, looking up and roaring non-stop.

Four leopards were trapped on the tree.

The blue-eyed lion king looked up and seemed a little surprised.

Wasn't there only one little leopard previously?

However, now was not the time to be distracted by these leopards. He had to find that little lion and kill him\!

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a lion following behind him suddenly realized that something was wrong.

A companion had gone missing\!

Behind the blue-eyed lion king, five strong lions had been following. Although they had split up when searching, they would quickly gather and split up.

But now, they were missing a companion\!

The blue-eyed lion king looked at the four subordinates and then at the female lions at the back. The muscles at the corner of its eyes started to twitch.

His subordinate was extremely strong and strong. He had once patrolled the territory alone and repelled many wandering lions. It was impossible for him to be killed by that little lion silently\!

Did this group of trash not hear anything when they followed behind?

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and immediately turned around to return to search with the pride.

At this moment, a trace of fear actually rose in his heart\!

Under the tree, only two foreign lions were left to continue guarding the leopards on the tree.

The other lions and female lions followed behind and expanded their search range.

This time, they did not dare to split up too far or walk too quickly. Instead, they gathered together and lined up two rows, slowly searching.

A strong smell of blood filled the air.

The blue-eyed lion king stopped in its tracks and quickly walked towards the grass not far away.

The four lions behind him hurriedly followed.

When they walked into the grass, they suddenly realized that the lioness that had been abducted previously had already become a corpse that floated above the waterhole dripping with blood.

The entire waterhole was dyed red with blood.

The blue-eyed lion king's eyes almost split open. Just as it was about to approach the waterhole, it suddenly realized that there was a pool of fresh blood and a few strands of black mane left in the grass.

The blood was intermittent and extended towards the forest in front of him\!

The grass was slanted and there were signs of something being dragged.

The blue-eyed lion king did not care about its anger and sadness. It immediately brought the pride and continued to search along the blood trail.

He wanted to skin that little bastard, pull out his tendons, and tear him into pieces\!

Not long after they walked far away, a head suddenly popped out of the waterhole covered in blood.

A figure covered in a black mane got up from the waterhole and walked towards the four trapped leopards.

At this moment.

On the tree, Belita lay on the highest branch and shivered as she looked up at the distant bushes with a complicated gaze.

Would the big smelly fart be killed by those terrifying baddies?

Under the tree, the two foreign lions raised their heads from time to time, bared their fangs, and roared at them.

At this moment, a dripping wet lion with a black mane walked out of the forest with a strong smell of blood on its body.

The two foreign lions were stunned and looked at him strangely.

They were the lowest existences in this pride and naturally knew the five "Guardian Deities" beside the blue-eyed lion king. However, this black-haired "Guardian Deity" seemed to be a little…

Furthermore, why were his eyes so wide?

Just as they were in a daze, the figure had already walked in front of them quickly.

"Gulp\!"

The black mane's head suddenly fell from its neck and rolled to its feet.

The two foreign lions were terrified\!

"Bang\!"

Before they could react, a claw suddenly slapped the head of a foreign lion\!

The foreign lion could not resist at all and fell to the ground. Its vision turned black and its body twitched. It could not stand up again\!

As for the other foreign lion, it was just about to roar and jump up when it was pounced to the ground and its throat was locked\!

Chu Xiaoye's head was covered in blood and he pressed it tightly to the ground.

On the tree.

Be it the male leopard, the female leopard, or the two little leopards, they all widened their eyes and watched this scene in shock.

On the ground beside him, the head with a thick black mane was still staring with its eyes wide open. It looked dignified without being angry and looked like it was alive\!

At the same time.

When the blue-eyed lion king brought the pride into an orchard, the blood on the ground suddenly disappeared.

At this moment, a lion discovered a mud pit with scarlet blood floating in it.

The blue-eyed lion king immediately walked over.

When a few lions extended their claws and pushed aside the fallen leaves on the water, they suddenly discovered a corpse without a head and neck\!

It was the corpse of a black-haired lion\!

His death was extremely tragic\!

"Roar—"

The blue-eyed lion king let out an angry roar again\!

This roar carried endless anger and hatred as it passed through the entire forest and spread to the distant grassland.

The members of the pride guarding outside the bushes were terrified.

Their king was furious again\!

Clearly, another important member had died\!

On the tree.

When the male leopard heard the lion king's roar, the muscles on his face twitched as he looked at the figure under the tree with a complicated gaze.

It seemed that tonight, this lion king's roar would last until dawn.

Suddenly, a shocking scene happened\!

After the young lion bit the two foreign lions to death, it did not leave immediately. Instead, it suddenly ran a few steps and jumped up with a whoosh. It actually jumped up six to seven meters and landed on a big tree opposite them, quickly hiding in the dense leaves\!

Not only was he shocked, his eldest daughter, Belia, also widened her eyes in disbelief\!

This kid actually jumped higher than them\! He was even more agile\!

"Roar\!"

Belita, who was lying at the top, looked at them disdainfully, as if she was saying, "What's there to be surprised about? Mom and I knew long ago\! Big smelly fart was a perverted lion to begin with\!"

"Roar—"

The lion's roar started to turn back.

The blue-eyed lion king seemed to have sensed that something was wrong and immediately returned with the pride.

Chu Xiaoye curled up and hid motionless in the dense leaves.

He did not know that the tree he was hiding from, be it the trunk or the branches, the bark was extremely smooth. Without claws, he could not grab it tightly.

However, at this moment, he was lying there as steady as Mount Tai and did not move\!
