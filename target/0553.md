Chapter 553: Elephant herd

The sky was starting to brighten.

Chu Xiaoye lay on the grass and stared blankly at the white sky, looking dejected.

Catherine accompanied him, and her eyes seemed to be sick. She kept rolling her eyes and muttered in her heart, "He's still pretending to be obedient after taking advantage of me…"

Not far away.

Lanisi was lying with the girls, talking in low voices and occasionally letting out delicate laughter. She did not feel sad or melancholic about the first time she had lost, as if nothing had happened.

Everyone knew and saw it.

The waves in the water surfaced and the clear stream allowed the girls who had heard the news to see it clearly.

Chu Xiaoye was so embarrassed that he wanted to find a hole to hide in.

However, the other party was not embarrassed at all. He even generously shared his recent experience with the curious and gossiping girls.

Chu Xiaoye felt that life was meaningless.

When the sun rose, there was no cover here.

They had to leave as soon as possible.

Chu Xiaoye got up and prepared to walk.

At this moment, Lanisi walked over and blinked. "Don't be stubborn. You must be out of strength. I'll carry you."

As he spoke, he turned around and squatted in front of him.

Fei'er and Doya were not far away and covered their mouths to laugh.

Chu Xiaoye felt even more embarrassed. He hurriedly waved at Denise, who was not far away and said, "Denise, come over. Carry me."

If not for the forced exercise last night, he would have long recovered his strength. This initiator actually dared to tease him. Damn it\! Even if he had to crawl, he would never let her carry him\!

How embarrassing\!

Denise ignored his call and even deliberately turned her head to look elsewhere, indicating that she did not hear him.

"Fei'er\! Come here\!"

Chu Xiaoye could only look at Fei'er.

Fei'er was a good girl and had always listened to him the most.

Unexpectedly, Fei'er suddenly leaned on Doya and said with an exaggerated expression, "Aiya, my legs are weak. I've been traveling for too long yesterday and haven't recovered yet. Lord Night, let His Majesty carry you."

Chu Xiaoye said angrily, "Are you coming over?"

Fei'er could only mimic Denise and turn her head to look elsewhere, pretending to be deaf.

"Vilis, come over\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the giant sword loli.

Vilis teased, "No, I'm too short and you're so tall. How can I carry you?"

In order to not piggyback him, this little lolita actually learned to laugh at herself.

Doya was too weak to count on.

As for Catherine, she was too short and shorter than Vilis. There were bushes and thorns everywhere. Chu Xiaoye did not want to be covered in wounds.

Furthermore, Catherine still had to jump up in front to scout the way.

"Night, no one is carrying you anymore, other than me."

Lanisi turned around and smiled with success.

This Elven Queen had actually started to learn how to be shameless.

Of course, from the beginning, she was very thick-skinned. To put it nicely, she was natural and unrestrained.

Chu Xiaoye really wanted to walk by himself, but after taking two steps, he realized that his legs were indeed a little limp and he was weak all over. He had exhausted too much in the water last night.

"Come on, you're a man. Why are you shy? No one's laughing at you."

Lanisi arched her body and took a few steps back. She hugged his legs and forced him onto her back, but she could not help but laugh.

Fei'er finally could not help but laugh.

Chu Xiaoye buried his hot face in the queen's fiery red hair and felt ashamed.

Not only was he raped last night, he was also carried by a woman now. He had lost all his face.

The mountain path was not easy to walk on.

Although Catherine was scouting ahead, every time she climbed up the tree, she would turn around and look at him resentfully, as if she wanted to see if he was bullied by the despicable elven queen again.

Fortunately, Chu Xiaoye recovered very quickly.

At noon, he had recovered most of his energy from last night.

He took the initiative to jump down from Lanisi's back and prepared to leave this annoying little demon.

Lanisi grabbed him and held his hand. "Night, you should have pulled me. I've carried you for so long that my legs are a little limp. Furthermore, last night was his first time, but you were so rough and…"

"Shut up\!"

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly covered her mouth and said angrily, "Don't talk nonsense\!"

The few girls in front seemed to be walking attentively, but they were actually eavesdropping.

"Alright, as long as you pull me, I won't say anything."

The high and mighty queen started to learn to be coquettish.

Women, ha\!

Chu Xiaoye could only pull her and travel with a worried expression.

This was not the outcome he wanted. It was definitely not.

He had always tried to maintain a distance from this Elven Queen.

Because he knew that she was different from others.

She was the hope of the elves and controlled the fate of the entire elves. If he became her, her responsibility would become his.

In the future, he would never be free again.

But now, what worried him still happened. He really became her, and she became his.

Even if this was her scheme, so what?

Could it be that he turned hostile and refused to admit it?

He, Chu Xiaoye, was not a heartless person.

Even when he was a lion and lived on the grassland, he was never really heartless.

Thinking of the grassland, he thought of Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, his mother, and the cold father.

He could not wait to see them and bring them in.

The world outside was about to collapse. He had to open the barrier and bring them in before the disaster arrived.

"How much longer before we reach our destination?"

He could not help but ask.

Just as Lanisi was calculating, Doya, who was walking in front, said, "After crossing this forest, we still have to pass through two beast kingdoms, then a human empire, and then we can reach the Rakshasa Kingdom you mentioned."

This girl knew the country and map of the entire continent very well. Before she left, she did some homework to ensure that she would not get lost on the way.

Chu Xiaoye frowned and said, "It's too slow to walk alone. Where can we get a pterodactyl?"

Doya shook her head and said, "It's difficult. Pterodactyls are very precious and rare mounts in every country. They won't be lent to us easily. Furthermore, I'm not familiar with those countries. However, if we encounter a market, we can buy a few horses."

Just as they were talking, the neighing of horses suddenly came from the forest in front of them.

At this moment, Catherine, who was exploring the tree, suddenly wagged her tail to show that something was happening ahead.

"There are orcs ahead, and there are many of them. They seem to be surrounding some animal."

Chu Xiaoye could clearly see the meaning of Catherine's actions and gaze.

"Elephants\! Those orcs will attack another group of elephants\!"

Chu Xiaoye was a little strange. Why would a herd of elephants run into this forest?
