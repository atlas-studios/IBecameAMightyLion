Chapter 584: The King of Beasts\!

Killers would eventually be killed.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and roared angrily, pouncing forward with the ferocious beasts\!

None of the eight humans were left alive. They fell into a pool of blood, were torn to pieces, and became food for the ferocious beasts.

On the horizon, the setting sun was like blood.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the side and looked at the distant sky. He could not imagine how terrifying it would be when this world collapsed.

He had to hurry.

After dark.

He brought the ferocious beasts to another village under the cover of the night.

The village here was still brightly lit.

The humans who had taken refuge came here and seemed to have quickly forgotten their pain and fear. They started to live happily again.

They had guns, so they were not afraid of the wild beasts on the grassland.

People wandered around in groups of two or three, admiring the night scenery on the grassland.

Chu Xiaoye let the ferocious beasts behind him continue to hide here.

He walked forward alone. His tall body quickly shrank and disappeared in the dense grass.

When the two human men walked into the grass with an ambiguous expression, they immediately disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye put on his human clothes and hat and walked out of the grass, walking straight towards another patch of grass not far away.

In the grass, the happy cries of a woman were heard and a man and woman were entangled.

Soon, the woman stopped crying.

Before long, Chu Xiaoye walked out of the grass with the woman and walked towards the village.

No one questioned or paid attention, because at this moment, they were all immersed in their happiness.

When Chu Xiaoye brought the woman into a dark alley, his cold eyes suddenly lit up in the darkness. At the same time, a cold killing intent quietly filled the air.

The woman's face was pale and she did not dare to move forward.

She seemed to have been here before.

Chu Xiaoye wrapped his arm around her waist and stopped.

"Wolves… Very big wolves…"

The woman said with a trembling voice.

At this moment, the owner of those cold eyes finally got up from the dark corner and walked over.

It was a strong giant gray wolf that was nearly 300 kilograms and was comparable to an ordinary lion\!

The gray wolf did not make any sound or show its fangs. It stopped in front of them and looked at them coldly, blocking the way. It was like a ghost, motionless.

The woman trembled and said, "It… It eats humans…"

This woman seemed to have seen this ferocious beast eat humans before, so she was terrified.

However, Chu Xiaoye still wrapped his arm around her waist and walked forward.

The huge gray wolf narrowed its eyes and finally bared its fangs. It let out a low whimper and its face became even more ferocious.

"Please… Please."

The woman was extremely afraid. She was held hostage by him and continued forward, getting closer and closer to the gray wolf.

"No\! Please\! No\!"

The woman suddenly stopped in her tracks, her face pale. She cried in fear and tried her best to retreat.

The gray wolf finally moved.

It raised its feet and walked over slowly, its gaze cold and wild, dark and disdainful.

The woman trembled and almost lost her balance.

However, suddenly, the gray wolf stopped in its tracks and looked suspicious.

Then, its entire body suddenly trembled and its wolf fur stood on end, as if it had sensed something terrifying. It was facing a great enemy and its entire body actually trembled.

It started to retreat\!

Chu Xiaoye dragged the woman and continued forward.

They took a step forward and the huge gray wolf took a step back, the bewilderment in its eyes growing stronger.

The woman was stunned. She turned around and looked at the silver-haired youth beside her, but she could not see anything unusual. They were only humans who did not carry any guns. How could they make such a strong and ferocious beast that ate humans tremble in fear and hind legs?

"Roar —"

The gray wolf suddenly whimpered and immediately tucked its tail between its legs. It turned around and ran. Soon, it disappeared into the darkness and disappeared.

The woman was tongue-tied.

Chu Xiaoye brought her and continued forward.

Just as he turned into another alley, a few cold eyes appeared in the darkness in front of him again.

They bared their fangs and let out low and fierce roars. Saliva flowed from the corner of their mouths as they walked over step by step.

They were three striped hyenas\!

Under normal circumstances, striped hyenas were smaller and not as fierce as spotted hyenas, but these three striped hyenas looked stronger and taller than the mutated spotted hyenas on the grassland. They also looked more ferocious.

There were no human soldiers guarding this place, but they were guarded by these ferocious beasts. Clearly, humans had injected some genes into these ferocious beasts, making them stronger and more obedient.

The woman's face was pale as she said with a trembling voice, "Don't, don't move forward… These dogs even eat lions…"

She had personally seen the hunter return with a lion two days ago, but he was eaten by three hyenas. The lion looked fierce and was no match for the three hyenas.

"Even lions eat them?"

Chu Xiaoye revealed a teasing smile and looked at the three striped hyenas in front of him.

Since there were no soldiers guarding the way and these wild beasts with certain genes were acting as watch dogs, there was no need for him to maintain his human body to avoid wasting time.

Three striped hyenas bared their fangs and walked over.

The woman's legs turned limp in fear and she actually fell to the ground.

However, suddenly, the same situation as before happened\!

The three originally fierce striped hyenas suddenly stopped in their tracks. At the same time, their fur stood up and their originally fierce and ferocious faces suddenly became terrified.

They were trembling.

Their tails hung down and were clamped between their legs\!

They started to retreat.

However, just as they took a few steps back, their limbs turned limp and they fell to the ground like her. Their faces were filled with fear and their bodies were trembling. They actually let out the cries of cats when they were terrified.

The woman suddenly sensed something.

A terrifying aura suddenly rose from beside him.

She turned her head with a pale face and looked to the side, but her eyes suddenly widened and her entire body was stiff. It was as if she was instantly frozen and did not move. Even her breathing and heart seemed to have suddenly stopped at this moment\!

A huge lion that was as big as a small mountain stood beside her. Its lush golden mane emitted a terrifying dignity and aura, causing her mind to blank and she was almost petrified\!

How… How did it appear?

Where was the youth?

At this moment, the woman was almost scared silly.

As for the three striped hyenas in front of him, they fell limp to the ground in fear. They peed their pants and trembled non-stop. They did not even have the courage to stand up and escape.

Didn't they like to eat lions?

This lion could probably fill them to death\!

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the terrified woman beside him with his terrifying eyes and face at a close distance.

The woman's entire body trembled and her eyes rolled back. She fainted from fright.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and walked forward.

The three striped hyenas trembled and let out pitiful cries, as if they were begging for something. Their bodies emitted the stench of feces and urine.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and walked past them towards the darkness in front of him.

He could smell the scent of other ferocious beasts.

He knew that the battle was not over.

There were stronger ferocious beasts ahead\!

However, he was the king here\!

Even if those ferocious beasts were injected with some powerful gene by humans and became stronger and more ferocious, so what?

There would always be only one king of beasts\!
