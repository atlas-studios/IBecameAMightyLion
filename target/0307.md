Chapter 307: Little Curly Tail's Tail

Five days later.

All the members of the pride recognized this young lion king again.

Over the past five days, Chu Xiaoye had left his scent at all the borders of this territory and observed all the members.

They did not find any spies for the black lions.

However, he discovered a few abnormal female lions.

Chu Xiaoye did not alert the enemy and let Lars and One-eyed watch at all times.

On this night.

One of the female lions finally could not hold it in anymore. Taking advantage of the night, she left the pride and walked out of the territory towards the neighboring pride of Haas.

Lars did not have the time to inform the other members and immediately followed behind personally.

When the female lion passed through the border and walked towards the bushes where the pride was stationed, Lars did not hesitate and immediately pounced on her, biting the female lion's neck.

Since he had confirmed the identity of this lioness, he could not let her go back and leak any information.

He bit the lioness's neck and thought that he could kill her in one move and not let her make any sound.

However, this female lion was rather strong. Even though her neck was bitten, she still twisted with all her might and suddenly grabbed Lars's face.

Lars felt the pain and could not help but let go of his fangs.

In the end, the female lion immediately took the opportunity to roar.

The lion patrolling the surroundings immediately roared angrily and ran over.

In the bushes in front of him, a few figures also rushed out. One of them was the lion king, Haas.

Lars was shocked when he saw this, but he was unwilling to let go of the female lion. He immediately picked it up, turned around, and ran towards his territory.

Just as he ran three to four meters away from the border, he was stopped by the few patrolling lions that were rushing over.

"Roar—"

The few strong lions roared angrily, as if they were questioning him why he wanted to trespass their territory.

Lars saw that he was surrounded and knew that he could not escape. He immediately lowered his head and continued to bite the lioness's neck fiercely, determined to make her unable to speak again\!

These patrolling lions seemed to not know the identity of this lioness. When they saw this scene, they were puzzled and shocked. They thought that they were killing each other, so they did not stop them.

Only when Haas ran over with the three guards and the other lions did one of the lion guards recognize this lioness. He immediately roared angrily and pounced at Lars, biting Lars's hind leg and wanting to drag him away.

However, Lars still bit the lioness's neck tightly and did not let go.

"Bang\!"

At this moment, Haas' huge claws flew over viciously and slapped Lars on the head, sending him flying.

Lars fell to the grass with his mouth full of blood. He struggled a few times, but could not stand up. He felt dizzy, his vision turned black, and his head hurt violently.

He raised his head with difficulty and looked at the female lion.

Fortunately, the female lion had already stopped breathing. Her wide eyes were filled with fear and unwillingness.

Haas was furious and immediately surrounded them with the pride.

Lars bared his bloody fangs and looked at him mockingly, not afraid.

He, who was once weak and timid, was no longer afraid even in the face of death\!

In this short period of time, he had changed and grown a lot.

At least he did not die in his lonely wandering life, nor did he die at the hands of those notorious hyenas, nor did he die in some dark and unfamiliar corner. Instead, he died in this soil that made his blood boil again.

He died worthy\!

"Roar—"

A familiar cry suddenly came from the grassland not far away.

Little Curly Tail brought the members of the pride of the cold father and roared as he ran over. He crossed the border without hesitation and came to his side.

The cold father bared his fangs and protected him.

His lush and black mane was still the same mighty and domineering aura that his father had when he saw wandering lions invading when he was young.

When he was young, he protected him; and now, he still protected him.

His father was still tall and mighty\!

The four female lions stood silently behind the cold father and faced the group of powerful lions in front of him with him.

Little Curly Tail stood at the side, wagging his tail and looking at the golden-haired lion king with a provocative gaze.

"Golden retriever, do you dare to fight me?"

His brother was rushing over from the territory behind with Mei Mei and the others. The other members could not arrive so quickly. He had to stall for time.

Haas seemed to have seen through his trick. He glanced at the members of the pride of the cold father and immediately issued the order to kill without hesitation.

"Kill without mercy, leave none alive\!"

"Roar—"

The lions that had long been unable to restrain their killing intent immediately roared angrily and pounced at the pride of the cold father.

Just as Haas was about to pounce on the cold father, Little Curly Tail's tail swept over with a whoosh. With the sound of the wind breaking, it was like an iron whip, fierce and fierce\!

Haas' pupils constricted. He immediately put down the cold father and jumped up, pouncing on this young lion with a long tail.

"Bam\!"

Little Curly Tail's iron tail slapped him heavily, but it did not leave any bloodstains, nor did it slap him away like it did with other lions.

At this moment, the golden-haired lion king had already pounced in front of him and suddenly smashed its fist at his head\!

Little Curly Tail could not dodge in time and could only swing his claws to block.

"Bang\!"

There was a muffled sound and the sound of bones breaking.

Little Curly Tail's raised claws were pushed back by a huge force. Then, his entire body was raised back and he fell to the ground with a bang, rubbing the grass and sliding out\!

An intense pain came from that claw.

Before he could stop, the golden-haired lion king pounced forward again. Like a big bird hunting for food, it landed from above and smashed his abdomen\!

If this punch hit, even a rhinoceros with thick skin and rough flesh would have its internal organs ruptured and die\!

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this critical moment, Little Curly Tail's tail suddenly jumped out and wrapped around the hind leg of a lion beside him. He suddenly swung his body and instantly used the force to slide out\!

The golden-haired lion king's fist hit the grass heavily.

Little Curly Tail flipped up and endured the pain in his front leg. He swung his tail forcefully and dragged the lion's hind leg, sending it flying and smashing it heavily at the golden-haired lion king.

"Bam\!"

The golden-haired lion king did not dodge. It slapped away the lion and rushed towards Little Curly Tail again.

Little Curly Tail immediately limped and rushed towards his pride. His iron tail suddenly swept over and swept away the pride that was biting the cold father and the female lions to the ground.

Then, he wrapped his tail around a strong lion and immediately swung it above his head.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Wherever he went, the strong lions were smashed until their bones broke and blood splashed as they fell to the ground.

The other lions were terrified when they saw this scene and did not dare to move forward.

Little Curly Tail protected his father and mother. The lion on his tail had long been badly mutilated and had become a ball of something that could not be distinguished.

He rolled up a lion with a broken skull and was crying out miserably again. He looked provocatively at the golden-haired lion king, still full of fighting spirit and not afraid.

His entire body was dyed with the blood of those lions. His head and face were dripping with blood, and his tail was wrapped around a lion that had yet to die completely. His entire appearance was ferocious and terrifying, like a demon that had just crawled out of hell.

Even the cold father, who was standing behind him, felt his blood run cold.
