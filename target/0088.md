Chapter 88: Friends

"Roar—"

A female lion pounced ferociously at Chu Xiaoye\!

The other two female lions were still attacking the female leopard, preventing her from escaping.

It was just a cub, and a lioness was enough\!

When the female lion bared its fangs and pounced ferociously in front of Chu Xiaoye, Chu Xiaoye did not dodge or show any fierce expression. He only waved his claws and slapped her face\!

A huge force suddenly smashed onto the lioness's ferocious half of her face\!

The female lion tilted her head and her charging body suddenly rushed to the side. With a bang, she plunged into the grass and bit the soil with her mouth, sliding several meters away\!

She lay on the ground with her mouth full of blood and her head buzzing. Her gaze was blank, and she was clearly stunned.

The two female lions that were attacking the female leopard instantly stopped and looked over.

Chu Xiaoye brushed his claws and felt that his strength seemed to have increased a lot.

He felt that his claws were hot and itchy.

He wanted to scratch her.

Of course, it was impossible to scratch people. He could scratch lions.

His gaze was dignified, as if he was the owner of this territory. He stared at the thieves that invaded the territory and walked towards the two female lions.

The two female lions were bewildered, but they did not retreat. They immediately put down the female leopard and roared as they rushed towards him.

"Roar—"

They bulged their stomachs, bared their fangs, and had ferocious expressions\!

Chu Xiaoye's gaze turned cold. He suddenly accelerated, jumped up, and used his two front claws to slap their ferocious faces\!

Then, he landed behind them.

The two female lions, one on the left and one on the right, dashed out diagonally. Their bodies tilted and they fell to the ground together. After rolling a few times in a sorry state, they stopped.

They raised their heads, their mouths full of blood. Just like the first lioness, their heads were also buzzing and they were seeing stars. They looked confused.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked coldly at their bulging stomachs. The sharp claws on his left and right feet were retracted.

He could not kill her in the end.

He thought of the pregnant Callie and Maya, and his mother, and the dead Gigi, and the other cubs, and even the entire pride.

If these three female lions were not pregnant, he believed that he would never show mercy.

But now, he still could not be as cold-blooded and heartless as a lion.

"Roar\! Roar\!"

The little leopard limped and hurriedly ran in front of her injured mother, licking the wounds on her body lovingly.

The three female lions got up from the ground in a sorry state, their mouths full of blood. They looked at the powerful cub in front of them in fear.

They found it unbelievable.

"Roar—"

A low growl came from the bushes beside him.

It was the roar of the lion, Seno\!

He smelled a strong scent of blood and the scent of the lionesses in his pride.

He roared and ran over.

The three female lions immediately pulled themselves together and roared at Chu Xiaoye, as if they were saying, "Little thing, my king is here. You're dead\!"

The bushes swayed.

The majestic Seno's mane fluttered as he bared his fangs and charged out of the forest ferociously\!

There was a murderous aura on that fierce and ferocious face\!

"Roar—"

The three female lions were extremely excited. Their mouths were full of blood, but they were very pleased with themselves. They continued to roar angrily at Chu Xiaoye.

Their king was here\!

However, the moment their king rushed out, he suddenly stopped in his tracks and the roar in his mouth stopped\!

It was as if someone had suddenly strangled his throat.

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

The three female lions did not realize it and continued to roar at Chu Xiaoye. As they roared, they bared their fangs and charged over.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them coldly, then turned around and looked at the lion king beside him. He slowly raised his right palm and extended his sharp claws.

The bright sun shone through the gaps in the branches and leaves and mottled the ground, also landing on his sharp right claw.

A flash of gold caught the tip of his claw.

"Roar—"

Seno suddenly roared angrily and twisted his body, charging towards a big tree at the side. He opened his fangs and bit the dry bark with a fierce expression\!

Under his fierce attack, the pitiful bark was peeled off the tree trunk.

Then, this majestic lion king turned around, raised its head, and stuck out its chest, returning the way it came.

He did not seem to see any female lions, female leopards, or young cubs present…

He walked very calmly, as if he was taking a walk.

The three female lions: "???"

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly pretended to be fierce and roared.

Seno, who was strolling calmly, suddenly trembled and ran away with a whoosh\!

They ran very quickly\!

In the blink of an eye, he jumped into the forest in the distance and disappeared.

Where did he come from and where did he go?

The three female lions:"…"

Chu Xiaoye put away his sharp claws and looked at them coldly.

If they did not know their limits, he could not be blamed for being cruel and merciless\!

At least, he wanted to teach them an unforgettable lesson and make them never to covet this territory that did not belong to them again\!

Although the three female lions were unwilling, they had no choice but to leave in frustration.

Their king had run away, and they were no match for this cub. No matter how unwilling they were, what could they do?

Their stomachs were rumbling with hunger, and they left in a sorry state.

When they returned to their territory, they saw their king standing in a daze at the borders of the territory. His two hind legs were trembling non-stop and urine was flowing down his hind legs intermittently.

"Roar—"

Seno suddenly turned around and roared at them. He continued to pee in shame and anger.

He seemed to be trying to hide something and cursed, "Idiot\! This King isn't peeing his pants from fright\! This King is marking the borders\!"

The three female lions did not dare to look at him again. They lowered their heads and left.

In the forest.

Belita was carefully licking her mother's wounds.

When Chu Xiaoye walked over, the female leopard immediately bared her fangs and trembled, letting out a terrified roar.

She thought that this cub was here to snatch her food.

She urged her daughter to run\!

Belita let out a roar and rubbed her face with her head gently. She comforted her gently, as if she was saying, "Mom, don't be afraid. The big smelly fart won't eat us. He only likes to eat smelly things. Otherwise, he wouldn't be so smelly."

The female leopard was still trembling in fear.

This cub was too terrifying. Its strength was unbelievable\!

Even the adult lion was so scared that its eyes turned blind\!

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of her and looked at the wounds on her body carefully.

It looked very serious. Some wounds were so deep the bones inside could already be seen.

If not for his saliva, this female leopard would definitely die.

Her daughter would definitely not survive either.

How could a limping little leopard feed itself?

Therefore, they could only rely on him.

However…

He was a lion.

In the bushes not far behind, Catherine hid there and secretly watched this strange scene. She widened her eyes in disbelief.

Could lions and leopards also help each other and become friends?

This completely subverted her understanding.

He was indeed different\!
