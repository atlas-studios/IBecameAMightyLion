Chapter 538: Alisha's Change

The next day.

Carter brought away the six thousand troops of Black Water City and left two thousand behind to maintain the order of Black Water City.

However, the leaders of the two thousand soldiers were replaced with Carter's men.

Under Carter's lead, the twenty thousand-man army charged towards the next city majestically.

However, before they could approach, the city was already empty.

The City Lord had long rushed to the capital with thousands of soldiers. No one knew if he had obeyed the king's orders or if he was colluding with Lusni.

Carter brought the army and did not stop in this empty city. She passed through the empty city and continued forward.

When they arrived at the next city, Domino City, the young city lord, Camodo, came out with five thousand troops to welcome them.

The Danota family still had many loyal subjects.

The young Camodo was one of them.

"Your Highness, I've been waiting for a long time. I received the news a few days ago that the Lusni family has gathered an army in the capital to prepare for a coup. We have to hurry to the capital and help His Majesty."

Camodo was tall and sturdy, about two meters tall. He had a beast horn on his forehead, his face was determined, and he had a dignified appearance.

Carter sat on the horse and looked down at him, then at the five thousand soldiers waiting behind him. Then, she said expressionlessly, "Camodo, I'm the queen now."

Camodo was stunned for a moment, as if he doubted his ears. He said, "Princess, you…"

Carter looked at him coldly and said, "Please call me Your Majesty, Camodo."

Camodo stared at her in shock. After dozens of seconds, he suddenly grabbed the hilt of the sword at his waist and took a few steps back. He said in a low voice, "Princess, I once swore loyalty to the Danota Family and His Majesty. I led the army out of the city this time to go to the capital to assist His Majesty. If you have other plans, forgive me for not being able to accept it."

An orc general behind him sneered and said, "Your Excellency, I've already said that the news is true. Princess Carter has long become a queen. You don't believe me."

Carter held the reins and looked at him with flickering eyes. "It's the Danota family anyway, isn't it?"

The orc general sneered and said, "Of course not. His Majesty is still alive. Even if he encounters an accident and dies unfortunately, the prince, Furn, will ascend the throne. Princess Carter is a girl. No matter how outstanding she is, even if she has made contributions to the border, it's not your turn to ascend the throne."

Carter suddenly smiled and said, "Then, do you want to be loyal to me or not?"

Camodo held the hilt of his sword and looked at her firmly. "Sorry, Your Highness, I'm loyal to His Majesty. This city of mine was also bestowed by His Majesty. I can't betray His Majesty."

Carter narrowed her eyes and nodded. "Alright, then…"

She raised her hand and said with a cold gaze, "Kill them all\!"

"Kill—"

The orcs behind her immediately roared and rushed up.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "Carter, no\!"

Carter did not stop ordering. She turned around and asked him, "Why not? Since they can't be loyal to me, why do you want to keep them? Do you want to keep them until they suddenly counterattack?"

Seeing that the two sides had already started fighting, Chu Xiaoye said anxiously, "This team is loyal to your Danota family. You can use them to march all the way back to the capital. Furthermore, there will be many troops loyal to your Danota family along the way. If you kill them now, we won't be able to get any help\!"

Carter shrugged and said indifferently, "As long as they're not loyal to me, I don't need them at all. What I need is my own army, not someone else's. Do you understand?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the young City Lord, who had been cut in several places and was lying in a pool of blood. He sighed softly and said, "Carter, you shouldn't be so anxious and ruthless. These soldiers might help you advance."

Carter smiled and said, "Night, you don't understand orcs. Orcs only respect the strong and fear the strong, and they are only loyal to the strong. Your soft-heartedness and mercy are useless here."

"Look, they've all surrendered."

Carter suddenly pointed at the soldiers who were about to resist and said proudly.

After Camodo and a few generals died, seeing those who resisted would definitely die, the five thousand soldiers immediately abandoned their weapons and knelt on the ground, declaring their surrender.

"If I did not attack just now, these five thousand soldiers would not be mine."

Carter smiled and kicked the horse under her. She took a few steps forward and said loudly, "Swear your loyalty to me and respect me as queen. You will then be forgiven\!"

"Long live Her Majesty\!"

"Long live Her Majesty\!"

First, her own soldiers raised their arms and shouted. Then, the soldiers kneeling on the ground immediately shouted.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the corpse on the ground and then at the high-spirited girl riding on a horse. He felt inexplicably suffocated.

They rested in this city for a day and continued forward.

When they arrived at the next city, it was already five days later.

They were less than three days away from the capital.

The city in front of him was tall and majestic. It was especially spectacular. There were castles everywhere and people were clamoring. It was rather prosperous. It was the second-largest city in the Kast Empire, Bingluo City.

There were twenty thousand guards in Bingluo City, but most of them were used to maintain order. Even during war, they rarely fought.

City Lord Mormont was a respectable old man in his seventies.

He had once issued an announcement that Bingluo City welcomed anyone, but it would never welcome war or fight for any war.

He only hoped that under his jurisdiction, his residents could live in peace and not be disturbed by any war.

The soldiers and citizens of Bingluo City loved and respected him, calling him the most benevolent and greatest city lord.

When Carter arrived with the 30,000-strong army, the Bingluo City was still flowing with people and merchants. The city gate was not closed and the soldiers were not on guard. It seemed that no one cared about them.

Two huge shadows flashed in the sky. They were two fire dragons.

The rich and stable Bingluo City seemed to lack nothing.

Carter brought the army and came to the field only 100 meters away from Bingluo City with a murderous aura. She looked at the ancient and rich city with flickering eyes.

Chu Xiaoye pointed at the road beside the city and said, "There's no need for us to pass through this city. Just go over from the side. There's a path there."

Carter turned a deaf ear and continued to look at the majestic and tall city with a burning gaze. After a long time, she turned around and looked at him. "Twenty thousand troops, countless wealth. Night, you know that I have just started fighting and still have to face many enemies. Not only do I need an army, I also need money. Otherwise, no matter how loyal they are, it will ultimately become an illusion."

Chu Xiaoye frowned and said, "However, you previously said that this city has always been aloof from the world. Even during the most chaotic times, no faction came to disturb it because the other party had long sworn that they would not participate in any battle, be it justice or evil. Furthermore, this city is the largest financial income of your Kast Empire. Its business is all over the country and even abroad. Almost every faction will need it. Are you sure you want to bring the army in, occupy it, or destroy it?"

Carter smiled and said, "I didn't say that. I just want to borrow their army and some wealth. My requirements are not high. I think Old Mr. Mormont will definitely agree."

With that said, she raised her hand and ordered the army to continue forward.

At this moment, the two winged dragons circling the city suddenly let out ear-piercing cries.

When Carter brought the army to the foot of the city, a white-haired old man walked out quickly with seven to eight young orcs.

"Princess Carter, is there anything that Mormont can do for you?"

The old man was the city lord of this city. He was thin and had two broken beast horns by his ears. His face was covered in wrinkles, but his eyes looked very bright and he was rather hale and hearty.

His smile was very warm, like a spring breeze.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly anxious for him. This old man was so bold. He did not even bring his guards or sound the alarm and brought out seven to eight young men. Did he not know how important he was to this city?

Or perhaps, he thought that every faction in Kast would keep their former promise and not have any ill intentions towards this city?

Or perhaps, he knew this Princess Carter and purely thought that this former Princess Carter, or the current Queen Carter, was still the Carter Danota he knew?

"Lord Mormont, long time no see."

Carter said calmly, but did not dismount.

The silver-haired Mormont climbed down from the horse and looked trembling. He was supported by a girl who quickly jumped off the horse.

"Princess Carter, Mormont will be at your service if you need anything."

The old man still said warmly.

However, Carter said with a faint smile, "I'm very happy to hear Lord Mormont say this. When I return to the capital with the army, I need two things: an army and money. I believe Lord Mormont has both, right?"

The smile on Mormont's face was still warm. "Of course. The things in Bingluo City are still very abundant. I can't say that there's everything you need, but we will have most things. I've already prepared the two things the princess wants for you."

The moment that was said, Carter was stunned. "You're already prepared?"

Mormont smiled and nodded. "Yes, the gold coins for the five thousand troops and five carriages have long been prepared for the princess. If it's convenient for you, you can take them today."

Carter frowned and stared at him for a while. Then, he suddenly smiled and said, "Lord Mormont is really generous. However, the army and amount of money I need is more than this."

Mormont raised his head and looked at the dense army behind her. He spread his hands and said, "Sorry, Your Highness, this is all I can give. If I give too much, the others will have no share. At that time, they will definitely not let the matter rest. Please forgive me, Your Highness."

Carter looked at the eight young men behind him and said, "Mormont, these should not be your guards, right?"

Mormont smiled and said, "I'm here to see the princess. Why bring guards? These are my grandchildren. They have long admired the princess' elegance and have always wanted to see her. This person beside me is called Doya. She has always wanted to go to the border and join the princess' subordinates to fight side by side with the princess."

The girl who was supporting him hurriedly lowered her head and said, "Your Highness, I hope to obtain your permission."

Carter looked at her with flickering eyes. The killing intent in her heart seemed to be wavering, but this was only temporary.

She suddenly raised her hand and said, "Then, Lord Mormont, you and your grandchildren will join me and serve me."

Then, the orc soldiers behind her suddenly rushed over and surrounded the old man and the young people in front of her.

Chu Xiaoye looked fixedly at the orc girl, and the scene from before on the grassland suddenly appeared in his mind.

Doya… Doya…

They had the same name, so how could it be that pitiful lioness cub?

Mormont was a little surprised. "Princess Carter, you…"

Carter did not waste her breath on him and said, "Lord Mormont, I need your twenty thousand troops and all the wealth here. If you're willing, you can be my subordinate and swear your loyalty to me. You'll still be the city lord of this city in the future."

Mormont shook his head and said, "No, Your Highness, twenty thousand troops is too much. Bingluo City is not any other city. There are people everywhere inside. It needs an army to maintain order. Furthermore, all the wealth you mentioned is even more ridiculous. The wealth of Bingluo City is not mine, or the Danota family's and the other families'. It belongs to all the citizens of the Kast Nation. Your Highness, you can't do this."

Carter pulled out the sword at her waist and looked at him coldly. "So what if I insist on doing this?"

"Your Highness."

The girl named Doya looked at her weakly and said, "Please don't hurt my father, okay?"

Carter narrowed her eyes and pointed the sword in her hand at her. She ordered the orc general beside her coldly, "Kill this girl first\! Let's see if our Lord Mormont is willing\!"

The orc general was about to attack when Chu Xiaoye suddenly shouted, "Stop\!"

He looked at the girl beside him, as if he did not know her, and said coldly, "Carter, you can't do this."

Carter smiled and said, "Night, you're my advisor. I'll naturally consider what you say. However, there are some things that you can't participate in. You're an elf and don't know anything about my orc race. There are some things that I have to be cruel about and use blood to resolve. I need the army and wealth of this city. I've already said it."

"However, you can't use this method\!"

Chu Xiaoye said angrily, "The City Lord has already come out and even brought his family out. They all admire you. They trust and respect you. The City Lord has already taken the initiative to give you the gold coins of five thousand troops and five carriages. Carter, you should be satisfied and grateful, not so greedy and cold-blooded\!"

Carter stared at him for a few seconds and suddenly looked at the girl beside Mormont. He suddenly smiled and said, "Night, don't tell me that you like this delicate and weak girl? If you like her, just say it. Don't be polite. I won't kill her and leave her for you to enjoy. You can enjoy her tonight. I'm serious."

"Alisa\!"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly shouted this name and looked really angry.

"I'll say it again. You can't do this\!"

Carter suddenly jumped down from the horse and quickly walked in front of the girl. A cold light flashed in his hand and he cut her throat\!

"Night, I'll say it again. This is not the grassland, this is the Kast Empire\! And I, Carter, am the queen here now\! The only queen\! What I'm saying is an order\!"

She turned around and looked at the young elf on the horse, saying coldly.

The girl covered her neck and fell to the ground. She widened her eyes and looked at her, at the princess she had admired for many years.

She did not know why this was happening.

Chu Xiaoye trembled. Anger filled his chest and burned in his eyes.

He did not know why the Alisa he knew would become like this?

Perhaps, this orc girl was no longer the female cub from before.

He was a little heartbroken.
