Chapter 506: Betting with the Little Lolita with the Giant Sword

The flames dyed the snow forest red.

The towering ancient trees that had protected the elves for tens of thousands of years fell to the ground and let out painful groans under the rough cut of the orcs.

Lanisi stood at the edge of the cliff and looked opposite silently. The fiery red hair behind her swayed slightly under the wind of the cold cliff, just like the emotions she could not hide at this moment.

The two cliffs were about 700 meters away.

Because they were flying, it was even more difficult to prepare the materials on the spot. No matter how fast the orcs were, it would probably take two to three days to repair the bridge.

However, it seemed that both sides were preparing to stand on both sides of the cliff. One roared provocatively and the other looked at each other silently.

Chu Xiaoye felt that this behavior was very stupid.

He turned around and looked at the tall and sexy elf girl wrapped in silver armor at the side. "Your archery is very good. I wonder if you know how to make bows yourself?"

Denise looked at him and did not answer.

She had pretended to be a mute for more than ten years and was already used to not speaking. She only spoke to a limited number of people.

The Queen turned around and answered for her, "She made Denise's bow herself. She was very talented at archery since she was young. Most of the bows in our Elf City were designed by her."

Chu Xiaoye glanced at the bows in the archers' hands and could not tell if they were good or bad.

However, he had a better idea.

When he observed the orc army opposite through the dark night just now, he realized that most of the orcs were very strong, and some were very tall and strong.

If those taller and stronger orcs were the vanguard when crossing the bridge, the arrows of the elven archers might not even be able to penetrate their armor.

Therefore, he had to have a few arrows with stronger penetration.

"Do you have a pen and paper?"

Chu Xiaoye asked the Queen.

Fortunately, he had human memories and had read many books. He still had a clear memory of the way bows were used.

A female elf guard immediately brought a pen and paper.

Chu Xiaoye could not take the pen and paper. He looked around, wanting to find a place where he could use the pen.

The Queen immediately squatted down and said, "You can sit on my back."

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment as he examined the fiery girl who had just ascended the throne for less than half a day.

Annie hurriedly squatted down, lowered her head, and placed her hands on the ground. "Your Majesty, let me do it."

She took the initiative to take the pen and paper, flipped her hand, and spread the paper on her back. She bit the pen and blinked her big eyes as she handed the pen to Chu Xiaoye.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and took the pen from her with his mouth.

Lanisi immediately walked over, squatted on the ground, and pressed the paper on Annie's back. Then, she looked up at him with a bright gaze.

Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate anymore. He immediately picked up the pen and used his memory to meticulously draw the shape of a crossbow on the paper.

He did not use his mouth to hold the pen, but his claws.

His claws could now move freely like human hands.

Although the painting was not good, it was very clear and complete.

The penetration power of this huge crossbow was extremely astonishing.

No matter how strong orc's body and how hard their leather armor was, as long as he was hit by such arrows, he could definitely fly higher.

When Chu Xiaoye was painting, the Queen and Denise came over and stood beside him on the left and right. The two young girls emitted their respective fragrances, and their long beautiful hair tickled his bald body and almost affected his performance.

When he finished drawing, Queen Lanisi was stunned.

However, Denise's eyes grew brighter and brighter, and there was even fear in them.

This bow was definitely the most terrifying weapon she had ever seen.

Chu Xiaoye used his claws to point at the pattern on the paper and said to her, "The larger the better. Of course, you have to use all your strength and make it easier to control. However, arrows have to be made with all iron."

He turned around and looked at the elf guard not far away. "It's harder and longer than the fur in his hand. Do you understand everything I said?"

Denise finally spoke and nodded with a burning gaze. "Understood."

Chu Xiaoye said, "Then, how many days can you use to make one?"

If it was too long, it would be meaningless.

Denise pondered for a moment and stared at the drawing on the paper with trembling eyes. "I can make three in two days."

Chu Xiaoye was shocked.

Lanisi smiled and said, "There are a few very powerful craftsmen at Denise's place who have specialized in archery their entire lives. It has been like this for a few generations. Because we elves are good at archery, we have many materials."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and said, "Then, what are you waiting for? Time is life. Go quickly."

Denise immediately took the blueprint and left quickly.

Vilis, who had been confused from the beginning to the end, walked over. She was curious, but she said with a mocking expression, "No matter how big they are, they're only bows. Furthermore, they have to waste a lot of manpower to pull the bow. The gains do not make up for the losses. It's better to let them pick up their weapons and fight."

"Idiot."

Chu Xiaoye commented rudely.

"Who are you talking about?"

Vilis turned her head and looked at him sideways. Her small hand tightened around the sword on her shoulder, looking furious.

Chu Xiaoye said, "What an idiot."

Vilis' fist suddenly hit him.

Chu Xiaoye dodged and swung his claws, leaving a few bloody marks on her white little fist.

In terms of speed, you're still too inexperienced\!

"Clang\!"

Vilis was furious and pulled out the huge sword on her shoulder.

Annie hurriedly blocked her path and begged, "Vilis, don't be angry. I apologize to you for Night."

Vilis held the sword with both hands and said with a cold face, "I don't accept it\!"

Lanisi said, "Then I'll apologize to you on his behalf."

Vilis looked at her, her small face filled with unwillingness. "Your Majesty, how can you lower your voice to a lion? Just now, you still had to squat down and be his desk. You're the queen of our elves, you shouldn't lower your head to anyone."

Lanisi shook her head and looked at her calmly. "No, Vilis, you're wrong. I'm indeed the queen of the elves, but the queen can bow down to anyone. If that person can help or even save us elves."

Vilis was stunned for a moment and looked at her with trembling eyes.

Then, she put away her sword.

"Then, I'll wait."

The huge sword loli put the huge sword on her shoulder again and still looked at a certain lion with slanted eyes. She said with a cold face, "If his method doesn't help us, I will definitely not let him go."

She paused and looked at the scratch on her fist. "He owes Annie. I won't kill him. However, I will ride him\! I want him to become my mount\!"

Chu Xiaoye did not back down and said, "Lady Vilis, let's make a bet. If I lose, I'm willing to be your mount. And if you lose, I won't let you be my mount. I'll let you lie on the ground and let me ride you once. Just once. How about that?"

Vilis clenched her fists, clearly very angry.

"It seems that Lady Vilis does not dare to."

Chu Xiaoye mocked.

Vilis immediately said angrily, "Would I be afraid of a bald lion? What bet? Tell me\!"

Annie cried out in her heart.

She really wanted to remind this elf sister not to be rash. The king's bet was a big pit. Whoever gambled would fall in and never be able to climb out again\!

Chu Xiaoye looked at the orc army opposite and said, "It's very simple. I'll bet that using my method, I can kill at least 300 orcs on the other side."

"Bullsh\*t\!"

Vilis snorted.

Of course she did not believe him. The orcs were so strong that his methods might be useful, but it was a fool's dream to want to kill the other party's 300\. It was impossible\!

"Then, do you want to bet? I'll be your mount."

Chu Xiaoye tempted.

Vilis hesitated for a moment, looked at Annie, and then at the Queen, but no one gave her a hint.

Actually, Lanisi also felt that this lion's words were a little exaggerated. 300 orcs were not so easy to kill. After all, they had dealt with orcs for many years.

Annie finally could not help but pinch her pinky with her two fingers and pull it as she whispered, "Vilis, don't, don't bet with him."

However, her kind persuasion made this huge sword loli feel that she had been underestimated and insulted.

Vilis shook off her hand angrily and said loudly, "Bet\! Why not? As a dignified swordmaster of the elves, why would I be afraid of a bald lion?"

As she spoke, she deliberately patted her butt and sneered at Chu Xiaoye. "Baldy, the taste of being a mount is not good\! I'll definitely let you enjoy the humiliation of being under me."

Chu Xiaoye opposed with equal harshness, "Shorty, the feeling of being ridden by a lion will be even worse. I'm a wild beast and my feces will come out at any time. At that time, don't be drenched in feces and urine."

"Heh."

Vilis continued to sneer.

"Hehe."

Chu Xiaoye also sneered.

Annie did not know whether to laugh or cry.

It was over. Poor Vilis still fell into the king's trap in the end.

Lanisi stood at the side and watched quietly, not stopping him.

At this critical moment of life and death, everyone was tense and felt despair. It was not bad to be able to mediate the atmosphere and mood in a game.

She really hoped that Vilis could win.

Because this way, this lion would never be able to escape from the elves.

The night passed quietly.

On the cliff opposite, the flames were still burning. The orcs were still repairing the bridge and roaring tirelessly.

The flames on the elves' side had been extinguished. The orcs could not see this side, but it did not affect their excited mood regarding the beautiful elf girl's fantasy.

At midnight.

Chu Xiaoye hid behind a rock and completed his transformation.

Of course he was naked.

Fortunately, Annie had already prepared his personal clothes.

A silver-haired elf youth wearing silver armor walked out from behind the stone.

The Queen praised, "Night, it's very cool."

Chu Xiaoye was a little shy. Just as he was about to thank her, Vilis said coldly, "Shorty, come over now and see who's the short one."

Chu Xiaoye wanted to punch her.
