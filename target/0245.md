Chapter 245: Change in the Food Chain

After eating.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and set off again.

He originally thought that the little white lion had already left, but unexpectedly, just as he entered the tunnel, she shamelessly followed him again and even deliberately walked in front to show that she was the king of this team.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her act of lying to herself.

The dark and damp tunnel was filled with danger when they came. Now, it was quiet and no unknown creatures appeared.

The aura of an expert made the creatures hiding in the dark instinctively fear.

Chu Xiaoye felt that it was his credit.

Of course, Tilly definitely felt that it was her credit.

The journey was smooth.

After leaving the tunnel, everyone was a little tired.

The world in front of him no longer had a monotonous snow-white color. Instead, it was filled with green.

He stood on high ground and looked at the vast grassland, feeling exceptionally good.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team down the mountain and stepped onto the land of the grassland.

They were shocked to discover that the grass on this grassland was even lusher and almost twice as tall as before.

The bushes and trees not far away were also taller and lush.

Obviously, not only did the strange rain mutate animals, it also changed the grass and trees drastically.

Furthermore, the changes did not seem to have stopped and were still continuing.

Suddenly, they saw a group of water buffaloes\!

The number of water buffaloes was astonishing. There were about hundreds of them, and all of them were huge. They were almost two to three times larger than before. They looked extremely strong and terrifying.

"Roarâ€”"

Just as everyone was observing the giant water buffaloes in shock, Tilly, who was walking in front, suddenly roared at the water buffaloes and bared her teeth, preparing to pounce on them to hunt.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat and he cursed inwardly.

Indeed, when the group of giant water buffaloes heard Tilly's roar, they turned around and looked. They immediately swung their tails, raised their heads, and charged over aggressively\!

Under the lead of the water buffalo leader, the hundreds of giant water buffaloes flew with their hooves and ran over with a rumble. They were filled with killing intent and did not treat them as terrifying carnivores at all\!

In front of their huge size and astonishing numbers, everything was weak.

Even the largest-sized Jerry brothers seemed so weak and fragile in front of them.

The force of this collision could even leave a big hole in a mountain\!

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate at all. Seeing the water buffaloes charging over ferociously, he immediately roared and called for the team to run towards the forest that had just come down.

When Tilly saw this terrifying formation, she immediately lost her previous aura. She turned around and ran, charging to the front of the team and running faster than anyone.

No matter how strong she was or how sharp her claws were, she had to flee in panic under this formation.

Any animal that was hit and trampled by this cavalry would become meat paste and die\!

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and fled into the forest, continuing to run up.

Just as the group of giant water buffaloes entered the forest, they heard continuous cracking sounds. Many trees fell from the impact.

However, no matter how strong a water buffalo was, it was also afraid of steep slopes.

They collided in the forest for a while before giving up on chasing and returning victorious.

After the group of giant water buffaloes left for a long time, Chu Xiaoye brought the team down the mountain and stepped onto the grassland again.

Be it before or after mutation, water buffaloes were not to be trifled with for lions.

Their group damage could be said to be invincible on the grassland. Even if elephants encountered them, they had to retreat unless the numbers were not too different.

After confirming that the water buffaloes had gone far, Chu Xiaoye continued on his way with the team.

Towards the little white lion that always caused trouble, Chu Xiaoye really wanted to slap her head to pieces, but he was afraid that the other party's parents would find him and slap his head to pieces. He could only give up.

Tilly continued to walk in front, leading them forward in big steps. She was not ashamed of what had just happened.

Soon, they saw another group of zebras.

The zebra's size also changed. It was tall and strong, and its four legs were even longer and stronger. When it ran, it was as if it was riding the clouds and flying.

Tilly's eyes lit up. She immediately used the cover of the grass to hide.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not stop her. He immediately brought the team and sneaked over.

The food in his stomach had long been exhausted after running around for days.

The flesh of herbivores on the grassland had always been their favorite.

Under Chu Xiaoye's signal, the team split up and formed a fan shape, surrounding the zebras.

Although the grass on the ground had grown much taller and was easier to hide, the zebra was also much taller. At the same time, its eyes, nose, and ears were more sensitive.

They could see further, hear more clearly, and smell more keenly.

If anything happened, they would run away with their four long legs.

Tilly's snow-white body could be used as the best cover on the snow mountain, but now, it was exceptionally striking on this green grassland.

Therefore, when she was about sixty to seventy meters away, she was already discovered by the zebra that was guarding the place.

With a neigh, the zebras immediately fled in fright\!

Fortunately, Chu Xiaoye, the mixed fur lion king, and the others had already circled in another direction.

At this moment, the zebras were fleeing in the direction of the mixed fur lion king and the Jerry brothers.

Tilly immediately got up and chased after it like an arrow that had left the bow. She actually arrived first despite being late. Soon, she caught up to a backward zebra and pounced on it\!

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine also chased after him from the side.

At the same time, the mixed fur lion king and the others in front of him immediately got up and roared as they charged forward.

The zebras that had just united and ran in the same direction immediately panicked. They split up and ran in different directions.

This gave the hunters a chance.

If they ran and charged together, with the advantage of numbers, the mixed fur lion king and the others would definitely immediately make way.

Now, they were split up and utterly defeated. They no longer had the might and impact from before.

The mixed fur lion king brought the three lions and the female lion and immediately took the opportunity to pounce on them.

The Jerry brothers relied on their huge bodies and pushed the two strong zebras to the ground, biting their necks.

Chu Xiaoye looked at their catch and immediately abandoned the zebra in front of him and walked towards Catherine.

Catherine had already opened the stomach of a zebra.

They would kill as many as they could. After all, this grassland would belong to them in the future. The lush grass here also needed these herbivores to repair it every day.

Tilly was the first to kill a zebra.

However, when Chu Xiaoye was eating the zebra that Catherine had caught, she ran over again and fought with Chu Xiaoye for it.

The strange thing was that she did not like to eat animal internal organs either.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her, tore off the zebra's thigh, and placed it in front of Catherine.

He raised his head and looked elsewhere. Everyone had gained something.

The hunt was very successful.

Although these herbivores had mutated, they could not escape the food chain of the grassland.

However, Chu Xiaoye suspected that some animals had already fled.

For example, the rabbit that only knew how to eat rabbits.

Of course, there should still be many creatures that quietly squeezed up from the bottom of the food chain. There should also be many creatures that fell from the top.

Chu Xiaoye was worried about the grassland on the other side of the mountain.

Therefore, after returning this time, he would bring the team to welcome Little Curly Tail and the others.

This grassland would become their true home in the future\!
