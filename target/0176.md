Chapter 176: The Dead King

"Ugh\!"

After a long time.

A heart-wrenching vomiting sound and an angry roar suddenly came from the forest.

As Belita vomited, she ran up the tree in a hurry.

She had actually forgotten this super invincible smelly fart\!

"Ugh\!"

To her surprise, Belia, who was on the tree, suddenly vomited too.

Could she smell the big smelly fart from so far away?

She did not know that her sister suddenly thought of her miserable encounter that night when she saw this scene and could not help but vomit.

The two sisters looked at each other and continued to vomit.

Not long after.

A ray of light appeared on the dark grassland.

Dawn finally arrived.

The strong smell of blood in the bushes filled the air and drifted towards the surrounding grassland.

From the roar of the pride last night, the nearby carnivores knew that there would be abundant meat waiting for them in this forest today.

However, he did not know if the king of this territory would allow them to enter and eat their fill.

Chu Xiaoye lay under the tree with his eyes closed, as if he was asleep.

The leopard family, who had been terrified for the entire night, also closed their eyes on the tree.

The pride had left and they were safe.

This young new king clearly knew Belita and was not too interested in their family. He should not hurt them.

There was plenty of food here and they were not a threat to him.

Instead, the environmental resources and healthy ecosystem in this territory might need their help.

Although the grass here was lush and there were many trees, herbivores were also in groups. Sometimes, there were thousands of herbivores of all sizes coming in to look for food every day.

Especially the fresh tender leaves in the bushes, which attracted those animals greatly.

Previously, there was a group of female lions guarding here, hunting and banishing those herbivores every day. That was why they could maintain the healthy environment of this territory.

Now, there was only him left in this newly built territory.

If other carnivores did not hunt those herbivores, in less than a month, the lush grassland and the lush bushes would be eaten by those greedy herbivores until they were bare and full.

Rabbits, antelopes, gnus, zebras, water buffaloes, giraffes, warthogs, and so on. Their habits and evolution of their mouths seemed to have been discussed. Some ate the tender tips, some ate the middle parts, and some did not even let go of the roots. Some even dug three feet into the ground to find roots.

If they were not restrained by carnivores, they would be even more fearless.

Therefore, this territory could not live without them.

Not only could this cub that had just ascended to the throne not chase them away, but he should also thank them.

When the sun rose.

A group of water buffaloes came to the grassland from the river and started to eat grass.

The nearby carnivores smelled the strong smell of blood drifting out of the bushes. They drooled, but they cowered and kept looking around, not daring to approach.

Among them.

Outside the borders of the territory, there were also two terrified lions.

The Chino brothers were terrified.

Last night, when they were peeing excitedly at the border to mark the territory, a terrifying roar suddenly came from the bushes.

They did not hesitate and immediately ran towards the bushes, preparing to fight.

However, when they ran close, they were terrified to discover that the enemy was actually densely packed and majestic. There were more than 30 of them, all extremely strong and murderous\!

There were more than 10 strong lions\!

The lion king among them was even more terrifying\!

That terrifying size was almost twice theirs\!

They peed their pants on the spot and turned to run.

It was not that they were not loyal, but the enemy was too strong and terrifying. They had yet to approach and were already scared stiff. Even if they went, what was the use?

They ran out of the territory that had just been marked in fear, like stray dogs in fear and despair.

They knew that their young new king would be doomed, and they would become wandering lions again. They would die sooner or later.

The lions here were too terrifying\!

They were dejected. They wandered outside, but they did not know where to go.

The grassland was full of the territories of other prides.

In front of those powerful prides, the weak them did not dare to walk around casually. If they trespassed their territory or encountered those powerful species, they would probably be bitten to death on the spot.

Therefore, they walked around and came back.

After dawn.

Peace returned to the bushes, but there was a strong smell of blood in the air.

They knew that the battle last night must have been very intense.

Their young new king was extremely strong and must have killed many members of the other party before he was defeated and died in the end.

They were ashamed and sad.

However, their instinctive fear of the strong made them powerless.

However, now, they might be able to return and help their young new king protect the corpse and avoid the destruction of other carnivores. They had done their part as officials.

The terrifying super pride should have already left.

Many carnivores hesitated for a long time before they could not resist the temptation of meat and walked carefully into the bushes.

The Chino brothers followed behind a few wild dogs from afar.

When they saw the corpses of lions all over the bushes, the shock in their hearts surged like a tide.

Even if their young king died, he would die in glory and dignity\!

His battle results would illuminate the grassland\!

The Chino brothers passed through the bushes and walked towards their former camp. The blood and corpses along the way made their limbs go limp. They could not believe it and admired the young king even more\!

They were even more ashamed and in pain.

Indeed, he was the true king\!

As for their brothers, they were only two timid, weak, and useless trash\!

Suddenly, their bodies trembled and they stopped in their tracks. They widened their eyes and looked at the tree not far away.

The familiar figure lay there quietly, covered in blood. Under the morning sun, he was so peaceful and majestic.

He was dead.

However, his heroic and powerful image as a king still lived in their hearts and minds, eternal\!

The Chino brothers trembled as they walked over, their eyes filled with respect and pain.

They could not bear to see his miserable appearance.

They walked to the side, looked at each other, lowered their heads, and started to dig holes with their claws, preparing to bury their young king in this forest forever.

This forest was the most glorious battlefield of his life\!

They believed that if their young king knew in the underworld, he would definitely be pleased.

Just as the two brothers were digging the pit in pain, they suddenly realized that something was wrong.

They turned around at the same time and looked at their young king.

He was looking at them with his eyes open.

The two brothers were stunned, but then they became even more sorrowful. Their king died with a grievance\!

They immediately worked even harder.
