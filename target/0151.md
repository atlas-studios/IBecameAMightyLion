Chapter 151: Beast Army

"Sss —"

The green vine monsters blocking in front of them immediately raised their heads in unison and bared their sharp fangs, letting out fierce cries.

The green vine monsters on the tree and behind them also twisted and swayed as they raised their heads to chase after him.

Chu Xiaoye waved his palms like lightning, fast and fierce. With a series of rapid slaps, he slapped the green vine monster pouncing on him to the side\!

The green vine monsters on both sides were hit by them and fell to the ground.

At this moment, the small elephant's thick and heavy feet trampled over their bodies like a thunderclap, leaving a ground full of twisted and twitching corpses\!

On the other side, the Chino brothers ran side by side, opened their mouths, and bared their sharp fangs. They charged forward bravely and used the lion's brute force to attack the staggering green vine monsters in an even more chaotic manner\!

Seeing this scene, the little animals following behind immediately ran even harder\!

With the lead of the invincible group of lions and elephant, they, who were trembling and preparing to close their eyes and wait for death, immediately erupted with all their courage and life force\!

At this moment, they had never been stronger and braver\!

"Boom\!"

In the orchard, the ground trembled and the vegetation trembled, as if an army was charging\!

Chu Xiaoye's palms became hotter and faster. The heat in his body continuously gave him strength, making him fight more and more bravely\!

The green vine monsters blocking the way were like pieces of paper that were sent flying by him. Just as they fell to the ground, they were trampled into the mud by the various feet that rolled over\!

Those docile and honest little animals also twisted into a force that made them afraid. They followed behind the sharp spear tip and charged bravely\!

Finally, they could not stop this unstoppable brave beast army\!

"Boom\!"

They rushed out\!

The formation of the green vine monsters was in chaos, but they were unwilling to give up and continued to chase after him\!

"Whoosh—"

A thick green vine monster suddenly fell from the tree and wrapped around the female jackal that was running behind Chu Xiaoye, hanging it up\!

The female jackal was terrified and struggled with all her might, letting out cries of despair.

The male jackal did not hesitate and immediately stopped in its tracks, turned around, and jumped up. It wanted to bite the green vine monster, but it could not jump too high and could not touch it.

It fell miserably and hit a giant forest pig at the back, falling to the ground with it.

"Sss —"

At this moment, the green vine monster behind raised its head and bared its cold fangs, quickly chasing after him\!

The giant forest pig immediately got up from the ground and continued to run.

As for the male jackal, after it got up, it looked up at its wife and stood in place without moving, its eyes filled with determination.

Jackals only had one wife in their lives and were loyal. They ran around for their families every day and had a deep relationship with their wives.

At this moment, it seemed to have given up on escaping and was preparing to die with its wife.

The female jackal hanging in the air also gave up struggling when it saw this scene and looked at it with an expression.

The couple looked at each other and waited for death.

Regardless of whether they lived or died, they were together\!

"Whoosh—"

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly flashed through the air. Like a bolt of lightning that lit up in the night, it bit the green vine monster\!

"Bam\!"

The green vine monster instantly broke\!

The figure fell to the ground with the female jackal\!

"Roar—"

An angry roar came from the figure's mouth. Then, he charged towards the green vine monsters that were about to pounce on him\!

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

He waved his palms and quickly slapped them, sending those green vine monsters flying\!

The female wolf stood up in a panic and looked at him in a daze.

The male jackal was stunned for a moment before it immediately rushed up and prepared to help bite the monsters\!

"Bam\!"

However, the figure slapped it back\!

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared at it, telling it to scram\!

This fellow was small and similar to a fox. He was not agile or strong. He was courting death by coming over to help\!

The male wolf was slapped and its face was burning with pain. It could only flee in panic with its wife.

"Bang\!"

After Chu Xiaoye slapped another green vine monster away, he immediately turned around and followed behind\!

In the grass beside him and on the tree above him, there were still green vine monsters that pounced out from time to time. They were all accurately and quickly slapped away by him\!

At this moment, not only was his front palm hot, even his back palm and entire body were hot\!

He felt that his entire body was filled with strength. He became more brave and excited as he fought\!

His amber eyes became brighter and clearer in the night\!

"Whoosh\!"

A green vine monster suddenly fell from the male jackal's head. Before it could open its mouth, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up, raised his right palm, and slapped its head\!

"Bam\!"

The crisp sound was extremely loud\!

Blood splattered everywhere as the green vine monster's head was smashed to pieces\!

The male jackal looked up and was shocked.

Chu Xiaoye landed in front of them and continued to run forward with them.

The jackals stared at the young figure, their dark eyes filled with gratitude.

The little elephant and the Chino brothers were still running in the lead\!

The little animals followed behind in an orderly formation. They did not fall behind or squeeze randomly. They followed those who did not leave midway and stayed behind them.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the mixed beast army formed by all sorts of animals and a ridiculous thought suddenly popped up in his mind.

If he became the king of the grassland in the future, could he form a beast army made up of all sorts of animals on the grassland?

The rabbit was led by the rabbit general, the monkey was led by the monkey general, and the giant forest pig was led by the pig general. They did their respective duties\!

They left behind the strong, eliminated the weak, protected the grassland, protected their homes, and prevented any foreign invasion\!

A king with such a beast army should be the true king of the grassland\!

Just as he was letting his imagination run wild, the little elephant in front of him finally stopped.

The little animals following behind also seemed to be trained soldiers. They immediately stopped in their tracks and stood in place. They did not whisper or leave immediately. They only widened their eyes and waited for orders.

They looked at Chu Xiaoye uniformly.

Because they knew that he was the hero who broke out of the encirclement this time\!

They looked at him with burning eyes, as if they were waiting for his orders.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before walking forward.

The little animals immediately took the initiative to open a path and stood neatly on both sides, looking at him with reverence.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the back of the little elephant and slapped its butt, letting out a low growl.

"Let's go\!"
