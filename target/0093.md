Chapter 93: His Shadow

But.

This was probably a disease.

Many illnesses during the dry season came quietly and were difficult to guard against.

Furthermore, most of them were fatal.

For animals, they were completely helpless and could not be treated. They could only let nature take its course and rely on their tenacious life force to resist.

Mei Mei could not speak.

Chu Xiaoye could not ask about her physical condition, nor could he find any clues from her. He could only give her more water to strengthen her immunity.

Little Curly Tail ran away in fright.

Mei Mei was pressed to the ground and her mouth was opened.

In front of her brother, struggling was futile and begging was useless. She could only obediently accept it and endure it silently.

After returning to the camp.

The cold father and the female lions were already lying in the grass to rest.

Little Curly Tail climbed up the Baobab tree and was pretending to sleep with his eyes closed, his body trembling.

His brother was becoming more and more perverted\!

Not only was he interested in his tail, he did not even let go of Mei Mei. What could he do?

When he heard his brother climbing up the tree, he trembled even more.

Suddenly, his brother crawled behind him and rubbed his tail again…

Little Curly Tail was terrified.

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the butt and handed the water bag to him, letting him get up to drink water.

There was saliva mixed in the water.

This kid's tail was so long that it might be a type of illness.

The parts that should grow were not long, but the parts that should not grow were abnormally long. If this was not an illness, what was it?

Hence, Chu Xiaoye decided to let them drink his saliva every few days just in case.

Little Curly Tail immediately drank the water while trembling.

Mei Mei did not dare to come up and hid beside her mother.

Chu Xiaoye was not sleepy at all.

He was still very energetic

He checked the three storage rooms. The food in them was well preserved.

Until the last moment, he could not eat them for the time being.

Many animals could survive the initial phase of the dry season, but most died at the last moment before the dry season passed.

The further they went, the more difficult it became.

Maya was about to give birth.

He had to save these food for the last moment.

Even Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei could forget about eating these food without his permission.

Their previous lesson had made the two of them understand that they could not touch anything here.

Otherwise, they would have to eat big smelly farts\!

After running around for the night, Chu Xiaoye did not force Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to continue training with him.

He climbed down the tree alone and entered the bushes at the back.

Of course, the female cub followed behind again.

He did not mind her secretly learning skills as long as she did not peep at him peeing and pooping.

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and jumped up from the tree trunk, landing on another big tree at the side.

He was as agile as a monkey\!

His two sharp front claws could easily penetrate the tree trunk and grab onto it to help him steady his body.

"Whoosh—"

He jumped towards another tree.

These actions could not only train his sensitivity, but also his body's coordination, reaction speed, and strength of his four limbs.

This way, he would be able to unleash the might of these golden claws more easily when fighting enemies in the future.

Furthermore, he hoped that his entire body was made of muscles and not fat.

His body could grow up, but he could not be obese.

Otherwise, he would become very slow.

Even though they looked fierce, they did not have any endurance or true explosive strength.

If he encountered anyone who ran fast and had sharp reactions, he would be played by them.

What he needed was not just his combat strength when facing other lions.

The various animals on the grassland and the animals that did not belong to this grassland were targets he needed to defeat or even kill in one move.

He was advancing towards this goal\!

If a lion lost its ideals, how was it different from a salted fish?

He was a male cub who was going to become a lion king\!

"Whoosh\!"

He jumped up to the highest point of the tree and suddenly jumped up. Like a bird, he landed on another tree five meters away\!

The sharp golden claw pierced through the tree trunk with a "chi" and stabilized his body\!

He swayed his body and jumped onto a nearby branch, starting to land layer by layer.

In the end, he landed steadily on the ground.

Catherine hid in the grass not far away and watched in fear. Her blood surged as she watched, and her breathing was rapid. She was infatuated.

This was her hero\!

Her mother was buried not far away. He had used his claws to dig a pit and helped her bury her mother.

She did not know why he buried her mother underground.

When lions died, didn't they just lie there and let other animals eat them up and end everything?

But now, she was very grateful.

Because she could come over to see her mother every day, talk to her silently, and chat with her, spending every lonely moment with her.

Or perhaps, her mother was accompanying her.

She was doing very well now. She was doing even better than she was at Bill's pride back then.

Because he was here.

She raised her head and looked at the distant figure with sparkling eyes.

After a long time, she walked out from the grass. With a whoosh, she jumped onto the big tree in front of her and jumped towards another big tree.

Her posture, movements, speed, agility, and even her wagging tail when she jumped were identical to his\!

She felt her entire body heat up and her sharp claws were hot. She was as light as a goose and had no fear.

He was her light and her role model.

If he could do it, she, Catherine, could definitely do it too\!

She would not let any member look down on her\!

Especially him.

"Whoosh—"

She jumped on the tree like his shadow, agile and brave, confident and elegant as she gradually disappeared into the distance.

The night was as black as ink.

The moon hid in the clouds.

At the foot of the hill.

The three wandering lions that had been defeated by the Seno brothers' pride were biting and eating another wandering lion.

They wanted to use the cruelty of devouring their own kind to restore their confidence. They would set off again to defeat the lion king and snatch their territory and lionesses\!

They ate the thin and weak wandering lion completely.

Then.

They walked up the hill and stepped on the withered grass. With their mouths full of blood and full of jealousy, they walked towards the pride of the cold father.

They were both lions, but why could they occupy the territory and the lionesses? They ate and ate every day and slept when they were full. As for them, they had to wander around, starve, and snatch food from wild dogs?

They were furious and indignant\!

They had already grown strong enough and formed an alliance\!

They believed that sooner or later, all the lions on this grassland would submit to them\!

They were the lion, the Three Swordsmen, of the grassland\!

And tonight, they would occupy the first pride of lions they would have when they reached adulthood and defeat the first lion king\!

They wanted to kill him and eat him in front of those lionesses\!

They wanted all the female lions to submit to them in fear\!

Whoever dared to resist would be killed without mercy\!
