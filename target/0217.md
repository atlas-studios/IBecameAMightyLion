Chapter 217: A Terrifying Slaughter\!

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye left with Catherine.

It was too boring to stay here. He might as well go around. Perhaps he could discover some enemies and exercise his muscles.

The wounds on the lion king's body could not be healed in a short time.

He could not expose his trump card in front of the pen bird and use his saliva to heal him.

Therefore, he could only wait.

Fortunately, this lion king was strong enough and its constitution was not bad. As long as he was given time, he could recover to his original state.

But.

His and Catherine's departure was clearly misunderstood by them.

Blue and the two warthogs immediately followed them.

The female lion did not hesitate and followed behind them.

They thought that he had waited for a day, no longer had the patience to wait, and wanted to leave.

The mixed fur lion king and the three lions silently watched their retreating backs with dejected expressions, but they did not make any sounds of dissatisfaction.

Because anyone who encountered such a situation would do so.

Didn't the mixed fur lion king abandon them last night?

And now, they had already waited for the mixed fur lion king for a day. It was enough.

The three lions lay on the ground with their heads lowered, looking worried.

The mixed fur lion king closed its eyes. It could only recover as soon as possible and did not want to continue being a burden to its three loyal subordinates.

The sun soon set.

Night fell.

The already dark forest looked even more sinister.

Just as the three lions were resting with their eyes closed, they suddenly heard a strange rustling sound as they quietly approached.

They suddenly stood up and looked in front and back.

The sounds were getting closer and closer\!

Then, pairs of dark eyes appeared in the forest in front and behind and quickly moved over.

When they saw the true appearance of these things, not only were the three lions shocked, even the mixed fur lion king suddenly stood up, its eyes filled with shock.

They were a group of strange fish that looked like giant lizards or giant crocodiles\!

These strange fish were all four to five meters long and were covered in scales, as if they were thick armor.

Two rows of sharp fangs grew out of their open mouths. They were dense and exceptionally sharp like steel saws\!

They were like crocodiles, wagging their tails and crawling forward quickly. Their huge bodies weighed five to six hundred kilograms and they were hugely different from the strange fish corpse that the white wolf had shown them previously\!

These strange fish were clearly more ferocious and terrifying than the mutated giant crocodiles in the river\!

At this moment, there were about a dozen in the forest in front and a dozen in the forest behind. No one knew if they were attracted by the smell of blood from the sea python or if they were here specifically to attack them.

The three lions bared their fangs and let out trembling roars, clearly terrified.

Even the largest mixed fur lion king seemed so insignificant in front of this group of giant fish\!

The other party's numbers were several times theirs\!

The other party's size and fangs were not inferior to theirs.

It would be difficult to determine the victor if it was just 1v1, let alone with so many enemies\!

"Roarâ€”"

The mixed fur lion king immediately roared angrily and let the three lions escape from the forest on the right.

He was already seriously injured and could not move freely. He could not escape and could only stay here and fight to the death.

His three subordinates could completely escape before this group of terrifying enemies surrounded them.

At some point in time, he had an additional relationship that even he had never thought of.

In the past, he would definitely have ordered his three subordinates to accompany him and fight to the death.

But now, he seemed to have suddenly thought of many reasons.

He was already dead. There was no need to implicate these three loyal subordinates.

His roar did not let the three lions leave.

Although the three lions were terrified, they still protected him from left and right, roaring angrily at the approaching giant strange fish.

In a moment, the surrounding paths were sealed.

More than twenty giant fish surrounded them.

At this moment, the three lions could not leave.

The mixed fur lion king immediately roared and limped as it took the initiative to charge towards the giant strange fish closest to it.

The huge strange fish immediately raised its head and opened its mouth.

"Bang\!"

The mixed fur lion king's claws were still heavy and strong as it slapped the huge strange fish's mouth\!

The huge strange fish tilted its head and its two big teeth flew out with blood. For a moment, it lay on the ground and did not move.

The other giant fish immediately opened their mouths and surged over\!

The mixed fur lion king limped and waved its claws as it retreated.

The three lions protected him and retreated to a big tree behind him.

They had their backs to the tree and started to fight to the death.

Although the mixed fur lion king was injured, its strength could not be underestimated. The huge strange fish that pounced on it were all slapped away by his claw.

However, the pain of his wound gradually made him powerless and his reaction was much slower.

When he raised his claws again and slapped at a huge strange fish, a huge strange fish beside him suddenly jumped up and bit his claws\!

Just as the two rows of sharp teeth of the huge strange fish were about to close, the mixed fur lion king immediately roared angrily. With a whoosh, its claws pierced fiercely into the jaw of the huge strange fish from inside. Then, it suddenly raised its right claw and picked up the huge strange fish. With a bang, it fell out and smashed heavily onto the head of another huge strange fish\!

Blood flowed from the mixed fur lion king's claws and they started to tremble.

At this moment, the other giant fish took this opportunity to pounce on him.

He could only open his mouth and retaliate with his teeth\!

When he bit the mouth of a huge strange fish, the other huge strange fish pounced on him and bit his face, neck, and front legs.

He let out an angry roar and bit the strange fish's mouth fiercely. He could not resist the bites of the other strange fish.

Even if he died, he would die with the huge strange fish in his mouth\!

The three lions standing beside him were also bitten by the ferocious giant strange fish until their faces were covered in blood and they could not move.

The four lions leaned against the tree and snuggled up to each other, biting this group of ocean enemies. They prepared to fight to the end until they took their last breath\!

The tall, mixed fur lion king with wounds all over its body attracted even more giant strange fish\!

At this moment, his head, face, neck, and thigh were densely packed with giant strange fish, overlapping each other\!

More giant fish crawled over from their companions and prepared to bite.

The mixed fur lion king lay on the ground and bit the mouth of the huge strange fish tightly. It did not move and was already numb to the pain on its body.

"Whoosh\!"

Suddenly, a huge strange fish that had climbed onto his back was about to bite his spine when a string of blood suddenly splashed out from its head\!

Then, the entire mouth of the huge strange fish fell down.

Golden light flashed and another huge strange fish that was biting his neck flew out.

The other giant fish immediately let go of him.

At this moment, he saw a familiar figure standing on the back of a huge strange fish beside him\!

The golden hair on his neck was so striking even at night.

Didn't he leave?

At this moment, the huge strange fish around them suddenly opened their mouths and rushed to the right.

The eyes of the mixed fur lion king were dyed red by the blood flowing down its head. He endured the pain and turned his neck to look to the right.

The young female cub was brandishing her claws and killing crazily in the huge school of strange fish\!

Blood splashed and flesh flew everywhere\!

Before the ferocious giant fish could open their mouths, their heads and bodies were cut open by the female cub's sharp claws\!

The male leopard followed on the right of the female cub.

The male leopard bit them one by one, emitting cracking sounds. It specifically bit the spine on the necks of the giant strange fish. Its movements were swift and precise, and the giant strange fish could not react at all\!

Behind the female cub and male leopard, the lioness and the two warthogs followed.

They specialized in killing.

After the male leopard and female cubs crippled the giant strange fish, they used their sharp teeth as their last attack to prevent the enemy from having any chance to resist\!

This strange team was like a wolf that had entered a herd of sheep. They killed as much as they wanted and were invincible. They killed until the flesh of the giant strange fish flew and corpses covered the ground\!

As for the young lion, after killing the huge strange fish beside the three lions and him, it immediately joined up with the female cub and attacked\!

Those golden claws danced up and down. Those who touched them would be injured and die\!

The huge strange fish that had just surrounded them were now surrounded one after another by the two young lions and slaughtered crazily\!

The person who wanted to escape had his spine bitten off by the extremely fast male leopard\!

In a moment, the twenty-plus giant fish were all lying here. Blood flowed like a river, and their limbs were broken, turning them into corpses on the ground.

The mixed fur lion king and the three lions lay on the ground, panting, looking straight at this scene.

Even if they wished that they could tear these giant strange fish into pieces, at this moment, when they saw the scene in front of them, they were not excited at all. Instead, they were terrified and their blood ran cold.

So many, so many ferocious giant fish were actually unable to withstand a single blow. In the blink of an eye, they were completely slaughtered\!

How could such terrifying strength not shock and fear them?

At this moment, they seemed to understand why the upper echelons of the snow mountain would summon these young helpers.

It turned out that they had long known their true strength.

Thinking of his rudeness and arrogance previously, the mixed fur lion king immediately felt extremely ashamed and its face was burning.

It turned out that they did not take him seriously at all and could not be bothered to bicker with him.

The mixed fur lion king raised its head and looked at the lioness and the two warthogs.

He finally understood their choice.

At this moment, the two warthogs seemed to be excited because this was their first time killing these ferocious carnivores. They were still using the fangs at the corner of their mouths to stab the bodies of the huge strange fish one by one. They were extremely happy.

They finally became arrogant\!

At this moment, the lion king and the three lions finally felt the pain in their bodies.

Especially the mixed fur lion king. It was covered in wounds, and the wounds on its head and neck were especially severe. The bones of its front legs had been bitten off.

Obviously, he could not survive.
