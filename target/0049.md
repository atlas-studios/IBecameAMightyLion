Chapter 49: The Flesh of the Enemies

Evening.

The sun was setting.

The heat on the grassland receded a little.

However, the dry air and hot wind were still unbearable for the pride.

They lay motionless in the shade of the bushes.

The adult gnu in the morning had filled the stomachs of the cold father lions. They could continue until tomorrow to hunt.

However, the water in his body evaporated too quickly.

They still had to go to the river to replenish their water in order to survive this long and hot night.

When the sun was about to set.

The cold father stood up from the grass and set off with the lionesses and cubs, walking towards the river at the foot of the hill.

The new female cub, Catherine, hesitated for a moment before getting up from the bushes and following him.

She was thirsty too.

Lars turned his head and roared at her with a fierce expression, as if he was deliberately scaring her.

Catherine looked at him and stopped in place. After he walked far away, she continued forward and followed the pride.

Mei Mei hesitated for a moment before turning around and running over to walk beside her. She let out a roar as if she was comforting her.

Catherine lowered her head, feeling dejected and timid.

At this moment, many animals came to drink water. They were all lined up by the river, stretching their necks and drinking water carefully.

The crocodile in the water had its back exposed and it was easy to discover.

However, there were always one or two unlucky fellows who thought that it was just a lump of wood that was dragged into the water and underwent a death roll.

When the lion, the cold father, brought the pride to the river, the animals drinking water nearby, be it carnivores or herbivores, all ran away in panic, staying far away.

The might of the predator at the top of the African food chain was vividly displayed at this moment.

The cold father walked to the river and looked at the river. He lay down and lowered his head to drink water.

A crocodile floated in the water and swam towards him slowly.

The lion raised its head, bared its fangs, and let out a low growl.

The crocodile popped its head out and looked at him before retreating slowly.

It seemed to know that lions were not to be trifled with.

The female lions immediately took this opportunity to drink water by the river.

Little Curly Tail lay down beside his brother, feeling safer.

No matter how terrifying a crocodile was, his brother could still defeat it\!

With his brother around, he was not afraid.

Lars was already scared out of his wits by the crocodiles because of what happened last time. Every time he came to drink water, he was always on tenterhooks and leaned close to his cold father.

Although Chu Xiaoye had saved him previously, his father was the strongest and most secure in his heart.

At this moment, he leaned against his cold father and carefully lay on the ground, stretching out his head.

Just as he was about to extend his tongue to drink water, Little Curly Tail suddenly let out a roar and jumped up from the ground\!

Lars was so scared that he jumped up with a whoosh. He almost lost his balance and fell into the river in front of him\!

Little Curly Tail looked at him mockingly and continued to lie down and drink water, as if nothing had happened.

Lars was terrified and his limbs felt like jelly. He trembled and did not dare to drink water again.

His mother, the lioness with a broken tail, hurriedly rubbed his head and comforted him gently.

The cold father almost finished drinking and prepared to leave.

He had to hurry.

Mei Mei brought Catherine to Chu Xiaoye's side and drank the water calmly.

As long as her brother was by her side, she was not afraid of anything.

Catherine seemed a little uneasy. After hesitating for a long time, she walked to the river and lay down.

At this moment, the cold father had already finished drinking his water and turned to return.

The female lions followed behind him.

Lars quickly got up and followed.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were also full. However, seeing that their brother was still drinking, they could only stand beside him and wait patiently.

The lion, the cold father, turned around and glanced at the three of them, his eyes revealing a cold glint.

They were still underage but they were already ignoring him?

Chu Xiaoye was already full.

However, the foreign lioness cub looked like she had just laid down to drink.

If he did not wait for her, she would not dare to continue drinking after just a few mouthfuls, right?

Suddenly, the water beside them swayed slightly under the golden setting sun\!

Black mud surged up from the bottom of the river\!

A black shadow was hiding under the water and slowly crawling towards Catherine.

It was a crocodile\!

The crocodile that had deliberately fallen into the water and hid all its body\!

Chu Xiaoye was shocked. He immediately got up and rushed over. He extended his front claw and wrapped it around the lioness's neck, lifting her backwards\!

Catherine flew up and tilted her head back. She spun in the air and fell to the ground miserably with a bang\!

"Whoosh\!"

At the same time\!

Water suddenly splashed everywhere where she had just drunk the water. A bloody mouth full of sharp fangs ferociously jumped out from the water. The two rows of fangs suddenly closed and bit empty air\!

Lars, who had walked not far away, immediately shivered in fear and almost crawled on the ground.

"Roar—"

Little Curly Tail walked to the river and roared at the crocodile fiercely, looking like he was not afraid of it\!

It seemed to be saying: If you have the ability, come up here and see if my brother doesn't blow your head off\!

The crocodile ignored him and quickly retreated.

Catherine crawled on the ground and looked at the crocodile that sank into the river and slowly retreated. Her limbs felt like jelly.

Then, she turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye.

Why did the strength that this cub had just erupted with seem to be even more terrifying than her father's?

"Roar\!"

Aisha was urging him.

Obviously, she sensed the cold father's anger.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to stay any longer and immediately followed her with Little Curly Tail.

At this moment, he saw a rhinoceros.

The rhinoceros stood alone on the hill, looking at the river below as if in a daze.

The thick and sharp rhino horn at the front of it disappeared.

The pride walked up the hill and came close.

It still stood there without any reaction.

When he was close, Chu Xiaoye realized that the cut on the broken horn of the rhinoceros was very neat. It did not seem to be caused by a battle but by something sharp.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, the roar of a lion suddenly came from the territory of the neighboring pride, the Seno Brothers.

It was the voice of the lion, Bill.

He was not dead yet.

Then, "Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!" A group of hyenas' excited and noisy cries rang out one after another.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze turned cold as he looked at the forest.

Was the hyena that killed Gigi here again?

He had planned to go to their camp again tonight and meet them properly. He did not expect them to take the initiative to come.

In that case, it was just nice.

Clearly, they had smelled blood, or they had heard their companions calling to tell them about Bill, who was about to die.

The flesh of their enemies would definitely be even more delicious to them.

As for the brothers, who had just ascended to the throne, they would definitely be happy to see them and help them clean the place for free.

“Ow Ow Ow\!”

Samantha the hyena queen's unique cries rang out in the bushes at dusk.

The hyena army charged over\!
