Chapter 416: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, an arrow suddenly shot out of the forest beside him. Before the colorful tiger could react, it pierced into the fur on his back.

The colorful tiger was shocked. It immediately jumped up and turned to flee\!

The arrow was stuck in its back and swayed. It did not pierce too deeply, as if it would fall at any time.

However, after the colorful tiger ran for a few meters, its limbs suddenly turned limp and it fell to the ground with a bang.

Chu Xiaoye had already jumped out of the pit when the colorful tiger was shot and happened to see this familiar scene.

The colorful tiger struggled on the ground a few times, seemingly wanting to get up, but it realized that its entire body was powerless. Its vision turned black and its consciousness became more and more blurry.

Clearly, the arrowhead was smeared with poison\!

At this moment, noisy cries suddenly sounded from the forest beside him. A group of humans wearing animal fur and colorful bird feathers ran out with bows in their hands, shouting as they ran towards the colorful tiger that had fallen to the ground.

Two of the humans suddenly shouted towards them.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked and hurriedly turned around to escape with Catherine.

From the clothes, language, and weapons these humans used, they were probably natives who had lived here for many years.

This trap was clearly their masterpiece.

These natives would also be afraid of the wild beasts in the forest and retreat after seeing them. However, the bows in their hands and the hunting experience passed down from their ancestors allowed them to kill the various wild beasts in the forest easily.

Of course, they were not much of a threat to Chu Xiaoye.

With Chu Xiaoye's current speed and strength, the poisonous arrows in their hands could not do anything.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not a lone lion. There was a group of team members following behind him.

As a lion king, he had to be responsible for all the members.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine and quickly ran back to the pride's camp. He growled and reminded everyone that there were enemies. He told them to crawl into the bushes to hide first and be prepared to fight or run at any time.

After the pride was ready, he jumped onto a big tree at the front and stood on high ground, looking over.

In this short time, the natives had already used the sharp blades in their hands to skin the colorful tiger. Its four tiger legs were also cut off.

Then, the natives walked over and stopped in front of the trap.

Two tall natives carefully jumped into the pit, broke down the wild boar at the bottom of the pit, and threw it up.

When the two natives at the bottom of the pit came up, a native pointed at the forest where the pride was hiding and spoke quickly.

Another native in a tiger dress shook his head and patted his tiger thigh and wild boar thigh as he spoke to the other natives.

The other natives nodded in succession.

Then, they found branches and leaves from the side and covered the trap.

After doing this, they looked in the direction where the pride was hiding and turned to leave.

Looking at their retreating figures, Chu Xiaoye finally heaved a sigh of relief.

If these people were greedy and still dared to come over, he did not mind letting them taste his golden claws\!

Although the natives had already left, it was difficult to guarantee that they would not return with more humans. Therefore, it was not wise to stay here for long. Chu Xiaoye immediately summoned the pride and rushed through the night.

When he passed by the colorful tiger, Chu Xiaoye looked at its miserable appearance and felt sad.

Such a mighty and majestic ferocious beast was killed by a small arrow. It was a little sad.

His sharp claws and teeth, as well as his running speed, seemed so fragile in front of human intelligence.

No human should be underestimated.

Chu Xiaoye would never underestimate even these natives who had never come into contact with outside civilization and technology.

As long as the other party did not take the initiative to provoke them, they could avoid them from afar.

They had not rested well these few nights and were always disturbed by uninvited guests. The members of the pride all seemed a little dispirited.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team and stepped on the path which was still somewhat muddy, advancing slowly.

After dawn.

They rested in the forest for a while and continued forward.

After crossing the third mountain, Chu Xiaoye realized that the distant majestic snow peak was getting closer and closer.

There were more animals in the forest and there was more food than before.

However, Chu Xiaoye still did not stop and continued to cross the mountains with the team.

As long as it was a place where humans appeared, it was not a good place to build a territory for the pride. They had to stay far away.

Chu Xiaoye hoped to find a true hiding place without any human footprints and expand his territory here with the pride to build a new home.

Half a month later, they started to climb the sixth mountain.

In the forest here, be it carnivores or herbivores, there were clearly more of them. Furthermore, most of them had mutated and become very strong and intelligent.

They had been traveling for three days without eating.

The pride was tired and hungry. After persisting until evening, Chu Xiaoye finally let everyone stop and rest.

Ahead was a stream that meandered around the mountain stream. No one knew where it flowed towards.

Chu Xiaoye led the pride and drank water by the stream.

The water in the stream here was cool, sweet, and clear. It tasted special when drank in the mouth.

After the little girl drank the water, she used the bull horn she always carried with her and filled it. Then, she stuffed it with a cork and hung it on the big black bear's back.

The cork was actually a small branch that she had cut with a knife.

Her leopard-skin coat, skirt, undergarments, and long socks were tied to the big black bear with a strong bull tendon. Not only was the big black bear not angry, it looked like it enjoyed the treatment of being a slave.

Anyway, Chu Xiaoye could not understand why this fierce-looking black bear was so close and gentle to this human little girl.

The little girl did not show any kindness to it, nor did she deliberately fawn on it. In fact, when sleeping at night, the little girl always abandoned it and let it sleep alone.

However, it was like a slave to this little girl. It did whatever she wanted.

Chu Xiaoye did not realize that this little girl had any extraordinary charm.

At most, she would sing and act cute and pitiful.

After drinking the water, Chu Xiaoye instructed everyone to stay in place and not stay far away. Then, he brought Little Curly Tail and the others, the Jiela sisters, and the six female lions out to hunt.

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the others stayed in the camp to protect the pride.

Not long after they left, another pride quietly followed the stream.

They seemed to have smelled something and started to slow down and approach quietly.

One of the young lions with a sparse mane seemed to have relied on his strength to rule this pride and become the king of this pride.

As he walked, the other members of the pride naturally maintained a distance from him to show his extraordinary status.

The young lion king suddenly stopped in its tracks and twitched its nose, as if it had smelled a scent that interested him very much.

It followed the smell and came to a patch of grass, where Belia and Mei Mei peed previously.

The young lion king looked very excited. He raised his head and looked at the forest in front of him with a burning gaze, not hiding his desire.

A pride needed lionesses, and it needed young mates.

Behind it was five lions. These five lions were tall, fierce, and looked rather similar. They should be brothers.

Behind these five lions were eight female lions. Other than one female lion that was slightly younger, the other female lions were all strong lions that had been through hundreds of battles and were covered in scars.

This was an extremely strong pride\!

The young lion king brought the team and lowered his body, quietly approaching the pride of the cold father as if he was hunting.

Looking through the gap in the bushes, the members of the pride of the cold father were still lying on the ground with their eyes closed and resting. They looked very tired.

When they approached more than ten meters away, the other party still did not have any reaction.

The young lion king was not pleased or happy. Instead, he was a little puzzled.

How could a pride that could survive until now be so lax?

Suddenly, the young lion king turned around and looked at the bushes on the right.

A huge lion's head suddenly appeared\!

On the ferocious face full of scars, one eye disappeared and the other was suffused with a dark blue light, looking as ferocious as a demon\!

"Roar—"

The young lion king was shocked and immediately roared, telling everyone to be careful.

They seemed to have been ambushed\!

Blue Eyes opened a cold eye and walked out of the bushes. His tall and strong body and fierce aura immediately made the auras of the few lions lower.

"Whoosh\!"

Another sound suddenly came from the bushes on the left.

Another tall lion with mixed fur walked out of the bushes. Its size and aura were also extremely strong.

The female lions behind the young lion king immediately trembled in fear.

Suddenly, two more tall lions with gray fur walked out from behind them\!

At the same time, the members of the pride of the cold father who were originally lying on the ground to rest stood up, bared their fangs, and walked over.

It turned out that they had long discovered this pride with ill intentions\!

"Bam\!"

At this moment, a fruit suddenly fell from above and hit the young lion king's head.

The young lion king looked up. On the branch above him stood a tall and strong male leopard with bulging muscles. On the branch not far from the male leopard, there were three other female leopards\!

Two of the young leopards looked similar, but their ecology was different. They were clearly sisters.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a deafening and terrifying roar suddenly came from the bushes on the left.

Then, a huge black bear bared its fangs and let out a terrifying growl. It walked over fiercely.

On the back of this big black bear sat a golden-haired little animal that looked like a gazelle or a little monkey.

The big black bear roared and walked forward. It broke the trees beside it with one claw and slapped the trees on the ground away, showing its strength ferociously\!

The female lions behind the young lion king were terrified and at a loss.

The five lions were clearly terrified as well. They looked in front of them uneasily, then behind them, then to the left, and then to the right. They realized that the enemies in either direction were terrifying.

They looked at their king.

Although the young lion king already had the intention to retreat, it was unwilling to retreat with a dejected expression.

He immediately roared angrily and looked at Blue Eyes on the right, then at the Mixed Fur on the left, challenging them.

He wanted to challenge the king of this pride\!

Of course, it was a one-on-one battle\!

However, until now, he still could not figure out who the king of this pride was.

However, no matter who it was, according to the rules of the pride, as long as he defeated the other party in the battle, he could take over this new pride, and the other party had to retreat.

However, he did not know that ever since this pride had the unique new lion king, they had long stopped following the rules of the pride.

Therefore, when this young lion king issued a challenge to the king of this pride, what awaited him was not their king, but their group beating\!

They attacked together without warning\!

"Roar—"

The cold father, who had finally become the head of the family, was the first to attack. He immediately rushed up with the few remaining female lions in the pride\!

With his two unfilial sons not around, he could finally let go and exercise his muscles\!

Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers behind were afraid that something would happen to them. They immediately rushed up.

Blue, who was standing on a branch, roared and pounced down from above, pushing a lion to the ground.

Before the young lion king could react, the cold father, Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, Aisha, and Xi'er pounced at him and started to beat him up\!

At this moment, the pit brought the two strong warthogs and also raised their mouths. They held their fangs and roared as they rushed up. Their sharp fangs pierced through the body of a female lion\!

The sudden attack of this violent storm instantly stunned this pride that was preparing to quietly invade. For a moment, they actually could not resist.

While everyone was fighting in full swing, the largest and strongest black bear was carrying the little girl. As it opened its mouth to roar and cheer, it quietly retreated, afraid that the sharp claws and teeth of these fellows would harm it.

"Everyone, work hard\! Big Bear will give you moral support\!"

The little girl felt embarrassed and immediately grabbed its ear to urge it to fight. Seeing that it could not dodge, the big black bear could only limp and walk slower than crawling speed. When it walked over, the battle was already approaching its end.

Other than the young lion king covered in blood who was still fighting valiantly, the other members behind him had already fallen to the ground. They were bitten until they were dripping with blood and were seriously injured.

The Jerry brothers, Blue, and the others, who were not in combat pounced at the young lion king.

The young lion king was immediately surrounded and could not cry alone.

When the big black bear saw this scene, it immediately became stronger and stopped limping. It roared and was full of energy as it bravely charged forward.

"Bang\!"

Unexpectedly, the young lion king was still strong. It slapped it.

The big black bear was like a frightened little rabbit. It suddenly jumped and retreated, then turned around and ran.
