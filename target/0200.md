Chapter 200: Subduing the Lion King

At this moment\!

All the lions in this pride, be it the young lions or the eight adult female lions, were terrified\!

This terrifying female cub was not only ferocious, but also had such terrifying strength\!

Even their king could not react\!

That speed and those movements were definitely not something they could resist\!

The young lions, who had been arrogant and provocative just now, felt their hearts turn cold. They trembled and lowered their heads, not even having the courage to look at this female cub.

In the animal world, all kindness was not worth mentioning. All kindness and gentleness would be considered weak and useless.

Only by being strong and ruthless could they obtain respect and fear\!

At this moment, after Catherine opened the stomach of the young lion without any warning, this once famous super pride instantly quietened down. No one dared to bare their fangs and roar.

In fact, he did not even dare to show the anger in his eyes.

They trembled in fear.

The blue-eyed lion king looked at his eldest son with heartache, but did not show any dissatisfaction.

He knew that the dignity of the lion king was inviolable.

Furthermore, the young lion king in front of him had saved his life and his family.

His eldest son deserved it\!

He did not look at the corpse again, but looked at the young lion king in front of him, hoping that he could accept his pride.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the young lions.

Now, they all lowered their heads, trembling in fear, respectful and polite. Compared to their arrogance and unwillingness just now, they were like two different things.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the cold lioness cub again and could not help but sigh inwardly. This girl's adoption was worth it.

Many a time, some things had to be resolved by force.

Although this move to kill the chicken to warn the monkeys was a little cruel and overbearing, it was very important to him, who had just established his territory and needed a reputation.

Be it this pride or the blue-eyed lion king, after seeing Catherine's attitude, they knew clearly that although their pride had few members and the lion king was very young, they were not to be trifled with\!

At this moment, the attitude of the blue-eyed lion king, the female lions, and the young lions had already indicated that Catherine's actions were very correct.

Chu Xiaoye did not refuse openly. Instead, he raised his gaze and looked at their territory.

His meaning was obvious.

"I can accept you, protect you, and help you defeat strong enemies. However, you have to be loyal to me. Furthermore, you have to return to your territory and guard that territory well."

This was called dividing the land and governing it.

The large territory over there still needed them to patrol and manage it. They would still live there. If they encountered an invincible enemy, he would bring the pride over to help fight.

However, normally, these two territories were still separated. They could not barge in without permission.

This was actually the method many super prides were using.

The territory of many super prides was too big, so they were divided into a few small prides. Each pride occupied a territory and divided the entire territory into a few small territories. Usually, they could not invade each other.

They would only gather together again when the pride encountered great suffering.

Chu Xiaoye's current territory did not lack anything and his members were just right. He did not want a large group of lions around him all day.

Furthermore, he needed to observe the loyalty of this pride.

The blue-eyed lion king was clearly a little puzzled, but he did not ask for anything more. He immediately lowered his head to express his agreement.

Then, he did not stay any longer. He turned around, lowered his head, picked up the young lion's corpse, and left quickly with the pride.

Catherine put away her claws and looked at her king.

Had his great ambition already started?

The strong blue-eyed lion king was indeed a good helper.

She believed that his great dream would definitely be realized\!

Just as she was looking at him with a burning gaze, he had already arrived in front of her. He raised his claws and rubbed her head to show his appreciation, as if he was praising her. "Girl, you did well\! What reward do you want?"

Catherine lowered her head in a reserved manner, her heart filled with happiness and anxiety. She hesitated for a moment and was about to express her wish to follow him forever when she saw him grin and aim his butt at her.

It was as if he was saying, "Then, I'll reward you with a big fart\!"

Catherine's expression froze.

Chu Xiaoye swung his tail and slapped her face before leaving.

"I was just teasing you\!"

He seemed to be saying this.

Catherine also grinned like him and immediately followed him. Her tail swayed gently behind her, and her heart felt as sweet as if she had eaten honey.

The Chino brothers stood in place and looked at them in a daze.

The sisters suddenly went forward and slapped them. They bared their teeth at them and let them continue to patrol the territory.

The Chino brothers immediately flew into a rage. After roaring angrily at the female lions, they immediately turned around and left to patrol the territory.

Now, their territory was not just this. The territory of the blue-eyed lion king over there was theirs\!

They could pee, hunt, and even seduce the female lions. With the fame of their boss and big sister, who dared to do anything to them?

However, that would show that they had no manners and rules. They would embarrass their boss.

Forget it, they should patrol this territory for the time being.

Thinking of how they almost starved to death on the road and shamelessly followed their boss all the way here, they felt that they had a special vision and were especially brave and smart\!

As for the two smelly female lions, how could they compare to them?

When they lived and died with their boss, no one knew where those two fellows were\!

In Boss's heart, they were the ones in front\!

If not for the fact that those two women worked hard every day hunting, they would have long slapped them and sent them to the other side of the mountain to eat feces\! Hmph\!

"Boom â€”"

An explosion suddenly sounded in the sky\!

The previously clear sky turned dark in the blink of an eye.

The Chino brothers were shocked.

At this moment, a huge snow eagle suddenly swooped down from the black cloud and circled above their heads, letting out a loud cry.

They had seen this snow eagle.

It seemed to beâ€¦ the messenger of the super huge white lion\!

"Roarâ€”"

The Chino brothers immediately turned around and roared at the bushes to inform their king.

In the sky, dark clouds soon covered the sky and a strong wind attacked.

Was something big going to happen?
