Chapter 99: Brother Is Crazy

"Cuckoo\! Cuckoo\!"

The cry of vultures suddenly came from the sky.

A few vultures were circling above the grassland not far away, looking down at the ground with their sharp eyes.

They were searching for animal corpses.

In every corner of the grassland, many hungry carnivores were looking up and watching their movements closely.

Once they discovered their target and prepared to land, those hungry carnivores would chase after them.

Not only did vultures eat rotten meat, but they would also hunt small animals when they were hungry.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and immediately left with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

They were too conspicuous while standing on the hill. If the vultures discovered them and gave a signal to the carnivores, it would be extremely dangerous here.

Maya had already eaten and would not need to go out to hunt for at least two more days. Hence, these two young cubs should be very safe.

When night came, he would still bring Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei over.

The recent appearance of those unusual creatures filled his heart with vigilance and worry.

The pride of the cold father finally welcomed two new lives. He could not let them die prematurely again.

The vultures in the sky were still circling and searching.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei and quickly entered the bushes, avoiding their gazes.

If they only ate jerky, they would definitely be thirsty.

Furthermore, they were hiding in a cave full of rocks in this hot weather.

Maya must be feeling terrible right now.

Therefore, he decided to bring another bag of water over at night.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail jumped around him and wagged his curled tail happily, looking excited.

Was it because he had a younger brother and sister to bully again?

He did not dare to bully anyone in the pride now. He was definitely depressed.

He had once dared to bully Catherine. Ever since he saw Catherine dig out the intestines of that wandering lion and turn into a strong lioness, he never dared to do so again.

That silent and lone lioness cub was even more terrifying than Mei Mei\!

Indeed, honest lions were not to be trifled with.

When they reached the forest.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment, turned around, and walked towards the border of the Seno brothers' pride.

The thin female lion had already left.

There was still blood on the ground.

The corpses of the two young cubs had already disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye stared blankly for a while. Just as he was about to turn around and leave, the bushes in front of him moved and another female lion walked over.

This lioness was also thin and haggard, but she had a big stomach.

She looked warily at the three young cubs in front of her. She hesitated for a moment but still walked over.

She lowered her head, and her nose fluttered. She stopped in front of the bloodstain and stuck out her tongue. She licked it greedily, even licking her mouth and swallowing a lot of soil and grass.

She was so hungry that her eyes were dazed and a little numb.

Little Curly Tail wanted to roar a few times to scare her, but he saw his brother turn around and leave.

He hurriedly left.

Chu Xiaoye's heart was heavy, but he did not have any mercy.

This was only the tip of the iceberg.

In places they did not see, there were probably more animals struggling at the edge of life and death.

This grassland was like this.

Life passed away quietly every day, and there was life born quietly every day.

Who could change anything?

He could only make himself work hard to survive. At the same time, he could extend his hand to help his family when he could.

As for the other lives, they had nothing to do with him.

He was helpless too.

There was only so much food. Even his pride could not guarantee that they would survive the dry season. How could he give it to another pride?

He was a lion.

He was not a human.

Even for humans, how many could selflessly sacrifice themselves for others?

The cruelty of nature would eventually teach him how to be a qualified lion.

He believed that he would definitely become a qualified lion king.

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

After returning to the camp, Little Curly Tail started to pester him and shout.

Mei Mei also followed behind him fawningly, rubbing against his body and still wanting to lick his butt.

They were hungry.

They wanted to eat meat.

The cold father raised his head and looked at him coldly as if he was still brooding over the previous warthog.

This kid was becoming more and more outrageous\!

If you still have food, take it out quickly. Otherwise, don't blame me for being impolite\!

However, Chu Xiaoye did not climb up the Baobab tree. Instead, he walked to a shade at the side and lay down.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were disappointed and anxious.

The cold father stood up and growled again, staring at him with a dignified and cold gaze.

Kid, are you itching for a beating?

Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he saw two cold gazes shooting out from the bushes on the other side. They were staring at him coldly.

He turned his head and his stomach and internal organs trembled.

The foreign female lion was staring at him coldly. She even opened her mouth and bared her sharp fangs, looking fierce as if she would pounce on him and cut his stomach open at any time.

The cold father turned his head and looked at the distant grassland with a dignified gaze. He yawned and lay down again.

Chu Xiaoye lay in the bushes and closed his eyes.

Mei Mei was very disappointed, but she did not dare to continue disturbing him. She could only lie down beside him aggrievedly and wait patiently.

Her brother must be tired. When he woke up, he would bring her meat to eat.

She waited.

Little Curly Tail could not wait anymore. He cried out anxiously at the side and even rubbed his head against Chu Xiaoye's. He looked pitiful as he scratched his ears and cheeks.

Chu Xiaoye still closed his eyes and ignored him.

After a moment.

Little Curly Tail was finally tired and quietened down.

He stood in front of his brother and waited for a while. Seeing that his brother seemed to be asleep, he immediately turned around carefully and walked under the Baobab tree.

Not far away, Catherine looked at him coldly.

This kid was playing with fire\!

Little Curly Tail paused under the Baobab tree for a while, seemingly hesitating too.

However, the hunger in his stomach soon made him unable to take it.

His brother would not blame him. His brother would definitely not blame him. His brother would never blame himâ€¦

He struggled for a long time in his heart before finally making up his mind. He raised his head and climbed up the Baobab tree.

However, just as he was halfway up, a figure suddenly jumped out from the bushes behind with a whoosh\!

Then, it jumped up and slapped him hard on the head\!

"Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail was caught off guard and fell off the tree trunk. He was dizzy and his entire body was in pain.

However, before he could get up from the ground, his brother's angry palm swung again and slapped him on the head\!

"Smack\! Smack\! Smack\!"

He was instantly stunned.

What was wrong with his brother?

How could he do this to him?

He was his younger brother\!

"Roar\!"

"Mom\! Save me\! Brother is crazy\!"
