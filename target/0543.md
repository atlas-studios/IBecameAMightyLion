Chapter 543: The Captured Chu Xiaoye

Although this was not his fault, he was the one who caused it.

Peace was about to arrive, but war suddenly broke out. This was not something anyone wanted to see.

"Carter, let's talk?"

Chu Xiaoye could only shout at the girl below.

Carter was still commanding the army and preparing to attack the city. After a while, he said coldly, "There's nothing to talk about. I only have one request. Come with me. If you don't agree, I'll attack the city and capture you all\!"

Sigh, was this the result of being too handsome?

She had destroyed a city for a face.

Chu Xiaoye sighed secretly.

However, when he saw that this girl seemed to really be determined to attack the city, he suddenly realized that perhaps she was not only doing this for him, but also for the army and wealth of this city.

Perhaps, deep in her heart, she had long decided to occupy this ancient and rich city.

"Carter, I'll go out. Let's talk."

Chu Xiaoye saw that the army had already brought the ladder over and hurriedly shouted.

On the city, Mormont immediately instructed his soldiers to guard the city with their lives.

Carter looked up at him and was silent for a moment. Then, he raised his hand and ordered the soldiers who were about to attack the city to stop. Then, he said, "Alright, come out. Come out with your elf dream, and Catherine."

"Lanisi, I'll go out alone. You can't go out\!"

On the city wall, Chu Xiaoye said to the Elven Queen with a serious expression, "Lord Mormont has two fire dragons here. I've already asked him to lend one to us when the time comes. If I can't return this time, go alone. Bring Catherine and set off as soon as possible."

Catherine quietly approached his feet and did not intend to let him go out alone.

Lanisi shook her head and said, "Night, let's go out together. If you're not here, we won't leave."

Fei'er also said, "That's right, Lord Night. Without you, even if we go, we won't be able to succeed."

Chu Xiaoye knew their intentions, but he had no choice but to tell them the truth. "Lanisi, Fei'er, Vilis, Denise, and Catherine, listen carefully. I'm not joking. In my opinion, you're all burdens. If I go out alone, I have countless ways to leave. However, if you follow, I have no choice but to surrender and be brought away by her obediently. Do you understand?"

Catherine understood.

She believed in the king's strength and intelligence. Although she was also powerful, she was not inferior to the king at all.

She lowered her head and quietly took a few steps back, feeling a little sad.

It turned out that despite her efforts, she had become a burden to the king at the crucial moment.

"Alright, I understand."

The Elven Queen blushed, clearly embarrassed and ashamed.

Indeed, in this youth's opinion, they were burdens.

However, this also indicated that they were very important to this young man. Otherwise, he would not have any scruples because of them.

"I refuse to accept this\!"

The huge sword loli glared at him angrily and held the sword on her shoulder. "I, Vilis, have never been a burden to others since I was young\! Do you know that you're insulting me?"

"I know. I'm insulting you. Can't you tell?"

Chu Xiaoye said seriously.

"You\!"

The huge sword loli was furious and almost could not help but draw her sword.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and said, "I'll go down alone. No matter what happens, you have to stay in the city and be obedient, understand? If I leave with her, you don't have to care about me. Just ride the fire dragon and leave. I'll definitely find you, I promise."

This time, Lanisi did not agree.

She said forcefully, "Night, we won't leave. We'll wait for you here until you return. If you never return, we'll wait for you here forever."

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in surprise and said, "Your Majesty, this is not your style. You're carrying the entire elven race on your shoulders now. If you waste your time waiting for me, you'll become the eternal sinner of the entire elven race."

"I don't care\!"

Lanisi looked at him firmly and said, "I want to wait for you\! I have to wait for you to return\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at her in a daze.

To be honest, he was a little touched, but he sighed even more. Damn, why was he so charming? Even the Elven Queen, who had always been thinking for her tribe, was captured by him and would rather give up the entire Elf Tribe for him.

"Night\! Are you coming out or not\! I'll give you one minute\!"

Carter's impatient voice suddenly came from below.

Chu Xiaoye immediately woke up and hurriedly walked to Mormont's side. "Lord Mormont, please put me down with a basket. Don't open the city gate."

Mormont looked at him sincerely and said, "If you're unwilling, you don't have to go out. This city is not so easy to break through."

"I'm willing."

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him and said, "Get the basket\!"

Mormont waved his hand and a few soldiers brought over a huge hanging basket.

It turned out that he was already prepared.

Chu Xiaoye jumped into the basket and looked at the old man. "Help me take care of them. I can't let them go out. I can let them leave on fire dragons. If anything happens to them, Lord Mormont, I will definitely turn your city into ruins."

"I believe you can do it."

Mormont smiled and said, "Young man, good luck."

Chu Xiaoye rode on the hanging basket and slowly fell. Looking at the dense army below, his blood suddenly surged, as if he was a hero who had fought on the battlefield. He could not help but sing passionately, "The wind is bleak and the water is cold. The strong will never returnâ€¦"

Damn\! This song was inauspicious\!

"Warrior, welcome back\!"

Before he landed, Carter had already raised his head and was waiting for him below. He was like a hungry wolf, looking at his delicious prey with green eyes and drooling.

When Chu Xiaoye landed, Carter grabbed his hair and dragged him out of the basket.

His actions were rough and rude\!

Carter was 1.74 meters tall. She could easily grab his hair with a random hand, but her strength was far inferior to his.

"Bang\!"

Although she had a magnificent army, Chu Xiaoye did not show any weakness. He suddenly punched her chest and was sent back a few steps. His hair happened to escape her iron claws.

"Are you courting death?"

Carter covered her chest and frowned.

Chu Xiaoye tidied his hair with his hands and looked at her coldly. "Although I'm short, I have my dignity. Your Majesty, I came down to negotiate with you, not to let you humiliate me. I hope you understand."

Carter narrowed her eyes and suddenly shouted coldly, "Tie him up\!"

Immediately, a group of strong orcs pounced.

Chu Xiaoye was about to draw his sword when Carter said, "If you dare to resist, kill without mercy\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped resisting and said angrily, "What are you doing?"

The orc guard immediately pressed him down and tied him tightly with rough ropes.

"What do you think? What can I do? Of course I'm insulting you\!"

Carter sneered and walked over. She pulled out the dagger from her waist and started to cut his clothes.

Chu Xiaoye said angrily, "Carter\! I'm your king\! You can't do this\!"

Carter cut the clothes on his chest and started to slide the dagger down again.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, let's talk calmly. Put down the dagger first."

Carter ignored him and looked up at the city wall. She said loudly, "Lanisi, I'll give you three minutes. If you still don't come down, I'll peel his clothes and cut off his things in front of you\! Anyway, I've already enjoyed it. As for you, you probably haven't seen it, right?"

Fei'er said from above, "We've seen it long ago. We don't care\!"

"Fei'er\! Shut up\! Don't speak\!"

Lanisi glared at her and said to the ground, "Princess Carter, we won't go down. We'll be leaving at dawn. We came out this time for the entire tribe. We can't be captured by you again for him."

Carter placed the dagger in her hand under Chu Xiaoye and sneered. "Do you think I'm joking with you?"

Lanisi said, "Whatever. Anyway, I've already said that we won't go down. Although he is indeed very important to us, we have to abandon him. There's no other way. Night, sorry."

Carter said coldly, "Alright\! Then I'll use my knife\!"

As she spoke, the dagger in her hand suddenly slashed down and passed by Chu Xiaoye's thigh, cutting a trace of flesh on his thigh.

The female elves on the city wall still did not have any reaction.

"Look, these are the little elves you want to protect at all costs."

Carter put away her dagger and said to the youth in front of him with a mocking expression, "They only think of their elves and won't care about your life. Other than me, who will care about you here?"

"Oh, I forgot. There's another one."

Carter raised his head and looked at the city wall again. "Catherine, you can understand me, right? Are you going to abandon your king?"

On the city wall, it was silent.

"Alright, there's nothing in this world that can't be abandoned."

Carter smiled and looked very pleased. She looked at the youth in front of her and said, "Now, do you still miss them?"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "No. Your Majesty, please let go of me. I'm willing to go with you."

A bright smile suddenly appeared on Carter's face. Then, she grabbed his chin and leaned close to his face. "Do you think I'm an idiot? I've already done this to you. Will you not be angry? I'm afraid that once I let go of you, you'll pounce on me to take revenge and hold me hostage to let you go. Am I right?"

Chu Xiaoye naturally would not admit it. He shook his head and said, "I'm not that petty, Your Majesty."

Carter sneered. "When you called her queen, you were already petty."

She stopped talking and instructed the guard beside her, "When he leaves, send him into my tent later."

However, she raised her head and looked up. "Lord Mormont, I hope you remember your promise just now\! I'll wait for you a kilometer away, so don't worry. I won't suddenly attack when you open the city gate. As long as you send me what I need, I'll leave immediately."

Mormont said from above, "Your Highness, put it down. Everything is ready. I can send it to you at any time."

Carter mounted his horse and said, "Let's go\!"

Then, the army left.

To the soldiers who were excitedly preparing to attack the city and obtain rewards, the Queen's decision disappointed them and made them sad.

Why would the queen like a short elf?

She actually gave up such a rich city for an elf\!

"Sorry, I have to remind you. I'm your queen's man. You heard it just now. Furthermore, your victory tonight was because of my scheme. Therefore, please be gentler to me and let me ride a carriage."

Chu Xiaoye was tied up and walked forward. Furthermore, he was always pushed by the orcs around him who disliked him for walking slow, so he was very unhappy.

"Your Excellency, you're right. However, now that Her Majesty wants us to treat you like this, we don't dare to disobey. I'm sorry."

The strong orc guard explained helplessly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at Carter, who was riding a tall and majestic horse behind him, and said in a low voice, "Women are like this. When they're angry, the more they like someone, the more rough they will be to them. When they're not angry, they will listen to you and be gentle and considerate like kittens. Therefore, brother, let go of me now and let me walk properly. I guarantee that I'll put in a good word for you in front of the Queen and let you rise in status and wealth."

"Really?"

One of the orcs was clearly tempted.

Seeing that there was a chance, Chu Xiaoye was secretly happy. He hurriedly said in a low voice, "Of course it's true. You probably saw it too. I spent the previous few nights in your queen's tent. You also heard just now that the queen asked you to send me into her tent later. What does this mean? It means that your queen can't leave me\! She was willing to risk everything to attack Bingluo City for me and give up that rich city for me. This means that she was willing to do anything for me, right?"

"Sigh, I don't know what's so good about you. You don't have a figure or muscles. Why would the Queen like you?"

"That's right. The queen was born noble, beautiful, and smart. Why would she like a little elf like you? I can't understand."

A few orcs could not help but complain, feeling envious and jealous.

Seeing that they were not thinking along with his words, Chu Xiaoye could only continue to urge them. "Let go of me quickly. Your queen will feel sorry for me in a while. The queen is high up and will definitely not say it out loud. Since you're the guards beside the queen, you have to learn to observe her expression. Whoever lets go of me first will definitely be appreciated by the queen. I will also do my best to help you put in a good word for the queen."

As long as the rope was untied, he would have a chance to escape. Now that his energy had yet to recover, he could not transform yet. However, even with the elves' bodies, his speed was definitely not something these orcs could compare to.

"Your Majesty, this kid is bewitching us and wants us to untie him so that he can escape."

Suddenly, the orc that seemed to be tempted turned around and reported to Carter behind him.

Chu Xiaoye's expression changed and he cursed in his heart.

Carter looked at him and said with a smile, "It's okay. Unbind him. The rope is too rough and the bonds are too dense. It'll be difficult for me to do it later. Change into chains, lock his hands and feet, and bring him to my tent later. Prepare more candles, whips, and so on."

"Yes, Your Majesty\!"
