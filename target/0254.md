Chapter 254: Father

"Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail's barbed tail suddenly swung out and slapped the miserable black lion, sending it flying\!

At the same time, the sharp thorns tore off a large piece of flesh from its back\!

The black lion fell heavily to the ground, landing in front of the pride that had rushed over. Its entire body was dripping with blood and it let out a painful scream.

The Killing God, Sed, stopped and looked down at the wounds on his body. Then, he raised his head and looked at the young lion with a strange tail in front of him. His gaze was cold and surprised.

Behind him stood eight adult lions with lush manes in their prime.

Not only did Little Curly Tail know a few of them, he had also fought them before.

These adult lions were lion kings of a certain pride in the nearby grassland or some wandering lion.

Now, they were all recruited by this strong black lion and became its accomplices in conquering the grassland and slaughtering their own kind.

They had already lost the dignity a lion should have and turned into a group of obedient executioners who killed the innocent and did nothing wrong\!

In order to survive, they personally killed their brothers, relatives, and even children who would never surrender.

Under the despotic might of the leader of the Mafia Alliance, they had already fallen from the original majestic lion kings to slaves who groveled and had no dignity.

Now, when they saw Little Curly Tail and this young old friend, they were not ashamed or sad at all. Instead, they were so proud and pleased. They were proud to be the slave of this black lion\!

Little Curly Tail only looked at them and lost interest. He looked at the taller black lion in front of him.

His mother was lying on the ground, covered in blood and unconscious.

The sounds of battle and roars behind him also stopped when this group of lions arrived.

The two lions that were covered in wounds from being bitten by the pride of the cold father fled in a sorry state and stood beside the black lion. They let out angry growls, as if they were complaining about something.

Was he complaining about the pride of the cold father bullying with their numbers?

The injured cold father looked at the ferocious lions with despair in his eyes.

However, he did not escape. Instead, he limped over with Xi'er, Callie, Maya, and Mei Mei. He stood beside Little Curly Tail and protected Aisha.

Little Curly Tail looked back at them. Every member was seriously injured and exhausted. They almost had no combat strength left.

Other than Mei Mei, who could recover extremely quickly.

Little Nuka stood at the back, in front of his brother's corpse. His head was covered in blood, but he did not escape.

He could not escape in this situation.

He seemed to have given up and was preparing to die with his brother in this territory that still belonged to them for the time being tonight.

The noisy night temporarily returned to silence.

Cold killing intent filled the night.

The smell of blood drifted on the quiet grassland.

Even the boss of the Mafia Alliance, who had his tail broken and his back badly mutilated, temporarily quietened down in this strange atmosphere and looked at the young lion in front of him with hatred.

Because their king seemed to be thinking about something.

The Killing God, Sed, sized up the young lion in front of him curiously, especially the tail behind him that was longer than his body.

He suddenly opened his mouth and let out a low growl. He turned around and looked at the pride behind him.

"Join us and serve This King\! Or die\!"

He liked the tail of this young lion.

As for his brother, the black lion with its tail broken by Little Curly Tail, he was clearly very angry, but he did not dare to express his dissatisfaction.

Hence, he walked forward and looked at every member of the pride of the cold father behind Little Curly Tail with hatred. He let out an angry growl.

Obviously, he wanted to kill the other members of this pride and take revenge\!

His brother, his king, did not hesitate. He grinned and bared his sharp fangs to express his agreement.

He only needed this strange tail and not the other members.

The lions and their families behind him were all killed.

Furthermore, he was not the one who did it. Instead, they did it themselves.

To these lions that looked mighty but were actually afraid of death, being able to survive was the most important.

He looked down at the young strange tail lion in front of him and a cruel smile appeared on his face. He added another one.

"Kill the other members beside you, join us and you can live\!"

This request was definitely not too high for a lion, especially for a young lion with a bright future.

Of course.

Little Curly Tail's answer was not too slow.

"Whoosh\!"

A straight tail suddenly whizzed over with a sharp wind and slapped his head heavily like an iron rod\!

Sed's body retreated like an afterimage.

"Bang\!"

As for his brother, the black lion standing beside him was smashed heavily on the head by the tail that suddenly whipped down\!

"Crack\!"

A crisp sound\!

He was slapped to the ground, his skull caved in, and blood sprayed from his mouth and nose. He died instantly\!

The other lions were terrified and retreated in panic.

Little Curly Tail put away his tail and turned around to look at the true boss of the Mafia Alliance with a teasing gaze.

"You want me to kill my family. Then, I'll kill your family first. Are you satisfied?"

His true goal was this crippled black lion.

The corner of Sed's eyes twitched and the claws on his feet popped out with a whoosh. He looked coldly at the little thing in front of him who did not know life from death.

Before him, no one dared to be so bold\!

Tonight, he wanted to kill this little thing that was courting death and his family, not leaving a single one alive\!

"Roar—"

He suddenly roared angrily and pounced forward.

His huge body, ferocious aura, and furious roar frightened the lions behind him into trembling in fear.

"Whoosh\!"

To Little Curly Tail's surprise, the cold father, who was standing beside him with a limp, actually took the lead to charge forward and pounce ferociously at the strong black lion king\!

He pounced without hesitation and wanted to bring him down with him\!

The cold father might know that he would not be able to survive tonight and wanted to use his life to hurt this powerful lion king, so that his son and daughter could have a little hope of survival.

Actually, he was not timid.

If not for his protection, his patrol every night, and his courage to defeat the enemy every time, how could these young cubs have survived until now?

At this moment, in the critical moment of the survival of the pride, as his father and husband, he erupted with his courage and responsibility again. He risked his life like a moth to a flame and charged forward bravely\!

He was using his life to create an opportunity for them\!

"Roar—"

His roar was still as loud and mighty as countless nights in the past when he protected his family and scared away the enemy\!

The black lion's huge claws slapped heavily at his head with the wind, like a black cloud that instantly blocked his vision\!

He suddenly raised his head, opened his mouth, and bared his sharp fangs as he bit down ferociously\!

"Unfilial son…"

For some reason, he suddenly muttered in his heart.
