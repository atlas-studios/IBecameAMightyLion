Chapter 230: Another Pair Of Golden Claws

It was already late at night.

However, the night on the snow mountain was as bright as day.

In Chu Xiaoye's vision, everything around him seemed so clear.

He quickly ran out of the forest and came to the boundless icy plain.

Here, even if danger approached, they could discover it from afar.

"Crack\!"

The ground suddenly collapsed. He was caught off guard and fell into the ice hole.

A chill instantly covered his entire body.

He soaked in the river water under the ice and looked at the scene in the water clearly.

It turned out that he had arrived at a frozen river.

The reason why the thick ice collapsed was probably because some animal had broken this place and the surface was only covered in a thin layer of snow.

In the cold river, many silver-white fish were swimming.

Chu Xiaoye was hungry.

For him, who could hold his breath, swimming underwater was easy.

Although it was a little cold, he was naturally not afraid with his physique.

He started to swim and chase the fish.

The fish under the ice were mostly stupid. They could clearly swim very quickly, but they were slow, as if they did not feel any danger approaching.

Perhaps, they all treated him as a larger species.

After Chu Xiaoye ate the two big fish, he was still hungry and continued to chase the fish at the bottom of the river to eat.

An hour later, he ate about twenty fish and felt a little full.

He temporarily could not sense if his body had grown up again, but he knew clearly that his appetite was still growing.

The fish meat that was eaten digested very quickly under the interference of the strange heat.

Some turned into nutrients, some turned into smelly farts, some turned into feces, and some merged into another substance to continue strengthening his physique.

He felt that he might never be able to escape his big smelly farts in his life.

As long as he was still eating, these trash would definitely be produced. As long as he was still growing, the impurities washed away by the heat would definitely turn into smelly farts endlessly.

Although it was a little awkward, it did not matter.

After all, this thing was like poisonous gas sometimes and could be a great deterrent to the enemy.

However, not every enemy was qualified to smell his farts.

He decided to try this skill that could not be revealed yet in the water.

"Pfftâ€”"

A stream of air suddenly pushed out from behind him\!

He raised his tail and was caught off guard. His entire body jumped forward with a whoosh and his speed was astonishing\!

It was like a rocket that was launching\!

"Bang\!"

He hit a big fish and knocked it out.

He opened his mouth, bit the fish in it, and started to eat.

Although he was having fun, he seemed to have forgotten the direction.

Where did he come down from?

The hole was also gone.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly became anxious.

Now that he was in the water and floating, no matter how much strength he had, he could not use it. The ice above him was also very hard and heavy. How could he go up?

He could only try and slowly dig with his golden claws.

Just as he was swimming up and preparing to dig open the ice, a black shadow suddenly rushed over from the water in front of him. It looked even larger than him.

It was a strange black fish with a sharp mouth and a back full of thorns.

It did not dodge or retreat and charged over aggressively\!

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly sank and dodged. He flicked his golden claw and prepared to open its stomach when it rushed over from above.

However, before he could do anything, a white figure suddenly jumped out from behind the strange black fish with a whoosh and bit its tail\!

"Whoosh\!"

The waves churned and the strange fish struggled with all its might.

However, the white shadow bit its tail tightly and did not let go. At the same time, the white shadow even extended two claws and pierced into its tail. Then, it suddenly swung and sent the strange fish flying. With a bang, it hit the rock beside it heavily.

The strange fish fainted on the spot.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that the white figure was actually a little white lion.

He knew this little white lion\!

However, the little white lion that was about his size back then was actually larger than him now\!

Her powerful performance just now was clearly much stronger than before.

This fellow's genes were indeed terrifying\!

Where were her two rhinoceros bodyguards? Could they have followed her to the water?

Chu Xiaoye looked around and did not see the two rhinoceroses. He heaved a sigh of relief.

Those rhinoceroses were now larger than elephants and had intelligence. He did not dare to provoke them easily.

He had played with this lioness cub until she wanted to die. He wondered if she still remembered.

Who cares.

Without bodyguards, he would not be afraid of her\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and prepared to sneak in another direction.

Right at this moment, the little white lion suddenly turned its head and looked at him. It was stunned at first, but then its eyes widened in disbelief.

"Whoosh\!"

She was very fast and actually jumped in front of Chu Xiaoye and stopped him. She looked at him in surprise, as if she was saying, "Hey, kid, why are you here too?"

"None of your business\!"

Chu Xiaoye muttered in his heart and raised his claws, showing the dignity and aura a lion king should have.

The little white lion looked at his golden claws and its eyes flickered. It also raised its foot and flicked out a sharp claw with a whoosh\!

Those claws were longer than his, but they were identical to his claws and were also golden\!

"Hehe, you didn't expect this, did you?"

The pride in the little white lion's eyes was about to overflow.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He could not help but swim close and stare at her claws. He even extended his claws to touch the golden claw.

The little white lion raised its claws proudly and let him admire it.

In the end, when Chu Xiaoye's golden claws touched her golden claws, an ear-piercing metallic buzz suddenly sounded in the water\!

At the same time, a ripple quickly spread out from the middle of their golden claws\!

Chu Xiaoye and the little white lion's bodies suddenly trembled and they were at a loss.

They hurriedly retracted their golden claws and looked at each other in shock.

After the ripples passed by, the fish not far away instantly rolled up their stomachs and fainted.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly realized that his golden claws seemed to have grown a little longer.

His eyes started to heat up. The tentacle on the mouth of the little white lion in front of him suddenly lit up like an electric fluorescent light. It was exceptionally dazzling.
