Chapter 90: Little Curly Tail's Tail

"Roar —"

Belita's pitiful cries came again.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in his tracks.

However, this time, he really did not look back.

He turned his head and looked at the bushes beside him.

The bushes were dense and it must be very shady inside.

The weather was so hot, so they could not run around randomly. It was better to hide in the bushes and catch a cold.

He turned around and crawled into the bushes, hiding his entire body inside and lying down.

The air was still filled with the smell of blood on the female leopard.

This would attract many hungry carnivores.

He happened to have an itchy golden claw and could practice his combat skills.

He turned around and lay down, his gaze fixed on the wind and grass around the leopard and daughter.

To become stronger, he could not slack off\!

Belita looked at the bushes he was hiding in for a while before she lowered her head and stuck out her tongue to lick the water in the water bag.

A sweet and cool liquid immediately flowed down her throat and into her body.

She shivered in comfort.

The hot temperature immediately became much cooler.

She quickly pushed the water bag in front of her mother and let her drink it too.

The female leopard lay on the ground and lowered her head to lick it.

She was out of her mind and had already lost all hope. At this moment, she had just licked a mouthful of water when she immediately felt her spirit lift. It seemed that even the pain in her body had lessened.

She was stunned for a moment and hurriedly continued drinking.

A moment later.

She suddenly felt hungry and wanted to eat.

She looked at the dead old crocodile beside her.

She struggled to stand up and walked over.

Belita was also very hungry and immediately understood her mother's meaning.

She looked up at the bushes and seemed a little embarrassed. However, she still walked over.

The mother-daughter pair immediately started eating.

Chu Xiaoye hid in the bushes and watched for a while, then got up and left from behind.

He felt that he should leave.

He had already done his best.

He gave her water, saliva for treatment, and food.

If this mother-daughter pair still could not survive, it meant that they did not have this life.

If they wanted to survive here, they could only rely on themselves.

The help of others would only make them more lazy and dependent, making them weaker and more likely to be eliminated by cruel nature.

Whether they could survive or not, they could only rely on themselves.

He had returned the favor of those few prey today.

In the future, they would never owe each other again.

He returned to the camp.

When Little Curly Tail saw him return, he immediately ran over and opened his mouth to rub against his body to show that he was very thirsty.

"Brother, water…"

Water during the dry season was exceptionally precious.

If this kid knew that there was a large amount of water hidden in both Baobab trees, he would probably go lick them a few times a day or even waste the water.

Although the amount of water in it was enough for him to waste it in various ways, it was too cruel for other animals that died of thirst because of drought.

Therefore, he did not intend to let them know the source of water.

Furthermore, this kid was not young anymore. Just like him, he was about to be a year old. He should be self-reliant and become independent.

Every time he was hungry and thirsty, he would look for his brother to eat and drink water. What should he do in the future?

Chu Xiaoye decided to ignore him and let him think of a solution.

He walked into the bushes at the side and lay down.

Little Curly Tail followed him with a fawning expression, twisting his body and acting spoiled in front of him. He even winked and wagged his tail like a pug that was trying to please its owner.

Chu Xiaoye expected better from him. He waved his claws and slapped him. He glared at him and told him to scram.

Little Curly Tail was stunned.

He shrank his neck and took a few steps back. Seeing that his brother seemed to be in a bad mood, he did not dare to continue pestering him. He could only lower his head and turn to leave.

"Eh?"

Chu Xiaoye stared at his tail, feeling puzzled.

This kid's tail seemed to have grown a lot.

Even though it was bent, it was almost dragged on the ground. Furthermore, the tip that was bent previously had become straight\!

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, a mosquito flew to the kid's neck. Just as it landed, the curved tail suddenly swung up and directly whacked the mosquito\!

This…

Chu Xiaoye suddenly stood up.

This was the first time he had seen a lion's tail being able to easily hit its neck\!

How did this kid's tail grow?

He remembered that it did not seem to be this long a few days ago?

"Roar\!"

He immediately called out to Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail stopped in his tracks and turned to look at him. He looked confused, as if he was saying, "Is Brother calling me?"

"Roar—"

"Come here\!"

Seeing how stupid this kid was, Chu Xiaoye wanted to go up and slap him again.

Didn't Lars's tragedy make this kid vigilant and worried?

If you don't change and become smarter. Let's see how you survive in the future\!

Little Curly Tail was extremely excited to see that his brother was indeed calling him. He hurriedly turned around and ran back eagerly.

His brother must have gone soft-hearted and prepared to get him some water to drink.

He knew that his brother treated him the best.

However, when he ran in front of his brother, his brother turned behind him and raised his claws to play with his tail. He was very focused on playing with his tail with his claws.

This made him feel a little embarrassed and even a little uneasy.

However, he did not dare to move.

Chu Xiaoye observed for a while and compared it with his. He realized that this kid's tail was nearly 20 centimeters longer than his\!

He was stunned, lowered his head, and looked between the kid's legs.

Strange\!

Why was this kid's tail developing faster than other parts of his body?

Such a long tail looked very asymmetrical.

No wonder this kid always liked to curl his tail into a circle these two days.

When Mei Mei saw him playing with Little Curly Tail's tail, she ran over curiously and stood behind him.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at her and immediately gestured for her to stand beside Little Curly Tail and straighten her tail.

He wanted to compare it again.

Mei Mei did not dare to disobey and could only stand with Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail and her looked at each other and saw the anxiety in each other's eyes.

What was his brother doing?

Chu Xiaoye observed for a moment. Mei Mei's tail did not change at all, and Little Curly Tail's tail was indeed different from the others. It was pervertedly strong.

Was this kid a monkey in his previous life?

"Roar—"

Suddenly, the roar of a lion came from the bushes behind the camp\!

It sounded like Seno's voice.

Then, the roars of a few more lions sounded out. They sounded murderous\!

The cold father suddenly stood up from the shade.

They were the three wandering lions that had previously roared on the other side of the river\!

They finally could not resist coming over to invade?
