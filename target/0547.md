Chapter 547: The Skill of the Black-Haired Giant Lion

The water buffaloes suddenly stopped.

These big fellows that had lived on the grassland for many years seemed to instinctively sense the dangerous aura in front of them.

They hesitated for a moment before turning to leave.

As for the water buffalo that Chu Xiaoye and Vilis were riding below, it jumped and jumped in place, sprinting to and fro on the brakes. It used all sorts of actions to try and throw them off its back.

"Chi\!"

Chu Xiaoye's sharp golden claw pierced into its butt\!

The water buffalo immediately let out a scream. It swung its tail and ran forward in fear\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped down with Alice.

"Catherine\! Continue to chase the water buffaloes forward\!"

Chu Xiaoye abandoned Vilis and jumped onto the back of another water buffalo. He slapped its neck, causing it, who was preparing to leave, to change its direction and follow the first water buffalo, fleeing in fear.

The water buffalo Catherine was riding also jumped forward with a scream.

"Lanisi\! Come here\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted at the few stunned elven girls.

The three water buffaloes had already run away from them and rushed towards the group of lions lying in ambush in the grass.

"Roar—"

With a roar, two lions jumped out of the dense grass first and pushed one of the water buffaloes to the ground.

Then, more lions and female lions rushed out.

However, the black-haired lion that was as big as a saber-toothed tiger was still hiding in the grass and not moving.

Its goal did not seem to be the water buffalo.

With so many ferocious beasts appearing in front of them, Lanisi and the others did not dare to move forward and hurriedly ran back.

The herd had already started to leave.

The three water buffaloes lured out the pride lying in ambush. Under the attacks of the lions, they all fell to the ground and were crying out.

Chu Xiaoye slowly retreated with the elven girls.

"Roar—"

Right at this moment, a low growl suddenly came from the grass.

Then, the huge black-haired lion slowly stood up from the dense grass.

The lions and female lions that were preparing to eat three water buffaloes immediately raised their heads and looked at Chu Xiaoye in unison. Then, under the lead of the black-haired giant lion, they walked over.

Fei'er's face turned pale in fear. She said with a trembling voice, "So… so big…"

The aura of the black-haired lion was too terrifying\!

Including this giant lion, this pride had a total of seven lions and more than ten female lions.

At this moment, Lanisi and the others were already exhausted from being chased by the water buffaloes and could not escape at all.

Even if they were full of energy, they would never escape the claws of this group of grassland overlords\!

"Clang\!"

Vilis pulled out her sword and said without fear, "Fight them\!"

When the water buffaloes were chasing just now, she stood at the back. Now, she was standing at the front.

Her short and weak body looked imposing at this moment. The huge sword in her hand flickered with a dazzling light under the evening sun.

Denise and Fei'er protected Lanisi on the left and right, aiming their arrows at the huge black-haired lion.

At this moment, they had to catch the king first.

"Denise, Fei'er, can you shoot the lion in the eye?"

Chu Xiaoye asked softly.

This black-haired lion had definitely mutated before. Back then, he had encountered a lion whose fur was like armor. Even his claws could not cut through it.

He was confident that his golden claws were sharper than iron arrows.

Therefore, if this black-haired lion also had armor, the arrows in Denise and Fei'er's hands would definitely be useless.

There was only one chance.

If they could not make this black-haired lion lose its combat strength in an instant, what awaited them would be the ferocious pounce of the pride.

"Sure\!"

Denise and Fei'er said in unison, looking very confident.

In order to hit the target with one hit, Chu Xiaoye decided to let the black-haired lion approach a little closer.

"Wait a while more and listen to my orders\!"

Chu Xiaoye whispered.

Vilis, who was about to take the initiative to attack, stopped.

"Roar—"

The black-haired lion suddenly roared and pounced ferociously with the pride.

They seemed to treat this pride's team as invaders.

"Fire\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The moment he spoke, Denise and Fei'er's arrows had already shot out and hit the black-haired lion's eyes\!

"Roar—"

The black-haired lion suddenly let out a scream and fell to the ground. Then, it rolled on the ground in pain. Its claws moved on its eyes, as if it wanted to pull out the two arrows that had been inserted into its eyes.

The lions and female lions following behind it were shocked and hurriedly stopped, their faces filled with fear.

"Look at the sword\!"

The huge sword loli roared angrily and rushed over with her two hands dragging the huge sword.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Denise and Fei'er shot their arrows again.

The two lions fell to the ground.

"Roar\!"

The other lions no longer hesitated and turned to flee in panic.

Vilis could only run towards the fallen black-haired lion that was still roaring and rolling on the ground.

"Move\!"

Right at this moment, Chu Xiaoye jumped past her with a whoosh. He raised his claws and pierced into the black-haired lion's head with a whoosh\!

The golden claw pierced in easily and did not encounter any hard armor.

Chu Xiaoye was a little surprised. The moment the black-haired lion opened its mouth to bite, he suddenly used his claws and cut its huge head into two.

It was impossible for such a ferocious and powerful mutated lion to not have other skills.

When the black-haired lion died completely, he placed his claws in the lion's blood. After waiting for a few seconds, he suddenly felt a heat enter his body from the tip of his claws.

"There are still skills\!"

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat, but he did not know what this skill was.

From the moment this black-haired lion appeared to the moment it died, it had never had the chance to use any skills. Its death was a little aggrieved and regretful.

"Why did you snatch my credit\!"

The huge sword loli walked over and said unhappily.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and said to Lanisi, "It's going to be dark soon. We have to bring the three water buffaloes back as soon as possible. The smell of blood is too strong here. I'm afraid it will attract more beasts and even orcs."

Lanisi hurriedly pulled out her sword and said, "The water buffaloes are too heavy. We have to cut some off, or else we won't be able to drag three of them."

Doya said, "It's enough for Athies to eat one. The few of us shouldn't be able to eat too much, right?"

Chu Xiaoye thought for a moment and said, "Then two. The few of you probably don't have much strength left. Catherine and I will drag one, and the few of you will drag one together. Is that okay?"

"You're looking down on me\!"

Vilis snorted and put away her huge sword. She ran in front of the corpse of a water buffalo and grabbed its horns. "I, Vilis, am born with divine strength. I alone am enough\!"

In the end, her face turned red and she used all her strength, but the water buffalo did not move.

At this moment, Catherine walked over and bit the water buffalo's tail. She suddenly exerted strength and dragged away a ton of water buffalo.

Vilis stood frozen in place and looked at her in shock.

She knew that this female cub was powerful, but she did not know that it was so powerful\!

This strength crushed her innate divine strength into dregs\!

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye also walked in front of a water buffalo and bit its tail, dragging it away.

Vilis:"…"

"No, my teeth can't take it."

Chu Xiaoye immediately put down the water buffalo and ran to Catherine's side to help her drag the water buffalo.

This female cub loved to show off\!

She was strong, but she could not use the teeth in her mouth to withstand the force. If her teeth were injured, it would be troublesome.

Lanisi and the others walked in front of another water buffalo and dragged it up with difficulty.

Vilis hurriedly ran over and joined in, then dragged the water buffalo away easily.

When the two water buffaloes were transported back to the bushes, the sky was already dark.

Athies had long woken up from his hunger. When he saw the food, he immediately wolfed it down.

A few female elves sat on the ground panting, dripping with sweat.

Doya pulled out the dagger at her waist and cut the cowhide.

This girl looked soft and weak, but when she did such a bloody thing, she was very agile and fearless.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine started eating.

Lanisi and the others rested for a while before surrounding them. They prepared to cut and eat with their daggers, but they were stimulated by the strong smell of blood and felt nauseous. They kept retching.

"Pregnant?"

Chu Xiaoye joked as he ate with relish.

"Scram\!"

Just as Vilis finished retching, she immediately glared and said angrily.

Fei'er said bitterly, "How terrifying. I really can't eat."

The elves had always eaten clean honey fruits as food and had never eaten such bloody raw meat.

Lanisi endured her disgust and ate a few pieces.

In this environment, filling her stomach was the most important.

They had not eaten for a few days.

Denise stood alone in the distance and did not come over, as if she did not even want to approach.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly shouted, "Denise, if you don't eat, how can you have the strength to protect me and your queen?"

Denise looked at him and still did not come over. Instead, she plucked a light blue flower from the bushes at the side, gently tore off a petal, and put it in her mouth.

The flowers here would definitely be difficult to swallow.

The edible flowers of the elves were all grown from special seeds. They were born with fragrance and sweetness and could replenish energy.

How could she be used to eating?

Indeed, the tall and stubborn girl frowned and threw the remaining flowers in her hand to the ground.

"Ugh —"

Fei'er barely took a bite and suddenly vomited. She started retching again and held back her tears as she said pitifully, "Lord Night, let me starve to death. I really can't eat it."

Chu Xiaoye admired these little elves.

He stood up and walked towards the bushes on the right. "Follow."

When he climbed up the tree to investigate the surroundings previously, he realized that there was an orchard in the bushes on the right. They were all low bushes and were covered in fruits that looked like oranges.

The reason why he did not tell them immediately was to force them to eat some beef.

After all, only beef had nutrients and energy.

Now, it seemed that they would rather starve to death than eat.

"Wow\! There are so many fruits\!"

Fei'er followed behind him and soon saw the bright yellow fruits in front of her.

Vilis also followed and said angrily, "Shortie\! Why didn't you say so earlier? You did it on purpose\!"

She had a fate worse than death just now and almost could not help but stuff the smelly food into her mouth. Thinking about it now, she wanted to vomit again, so she was naturally very angry.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and said to Fei'er, who was behind him, "Bring the clothes and follow me over there. I'm going to transform."

Seeing these fruits, his appetite increased.

When he was with these little elves, he was really like a pet if he was a lion.

Lanisi and Denise had followed him. He had to go to the dense bushes to hide and transform, or they would see him clearly again.

"Hmph, it's not like I haven't seen it before\!"

Vilis snorted coldly and hurriedly picked a fruit, preparing to eat.

She was already hungry.

Fei'er followed closely behind Chu Xiaoye and walked into the bushes not far away.

"Fei'er, put down your clothes. Go and eat fruits quickly."

Chu Xiaoye hid in the bushes and prepared to transform.

Fei'er hurriedly shook her head and said, "No, Lord Night, I can't leave you. If anything happens to you, Her Majesty will be very sad, and Fei'er will also be very sad and blame herself. Fei'er has already seen Lord Night's body and knows it like the back of her hand. Therefore, Lord Night, you don't have to be shy. Just change."

Seeing her innocent look, Chu Xiaoye could only say, "Then turn around."

"No\!"

Fei'er immediately rejected him and especially widened her eyes. She said, "Lord Night is in the most dangerous when you transform. Fei'er has to watch with her eyes wide open."

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with her. Anyway, he was a man and she was not afraid of a little girl. What was he afraid of?

"I'll change\!"

With a thought, he suddenly grew taller and turned into an elf youth.

"Ah\! It's huge\!"

Fei'er suddenly screamed.

Not far away, Lanisi and the others, who were eating fruits, were shocked.

Lanisi hurriedly said, "Fei'er, what's wrong? What's so huge?"

With that said, the Queen's face suddenly turned red. She could not care less about eating fruits and walked over quickly.

At this moment, Fei'er looked shocked and stammered, "Lord… Lord Night's body has become so big\!"

Chu Xiaoye was also stunned in place.

He realized that his body as an elf youth suddenly became taller, and he was even taller than Fei'er, who was 1.74 meters tall\!

"It's so tall\! Not so big\!"

He could not help but remind her. Then, he hurriedly put on his clothes and looked at Lanisi, who was walking over quickly. "Don't come over\! I'm not wearing pants yet\!"

Lanisi still walked over quickly and covered her mouth as she cried out, "Ah\! It's really big\!"

"Scram\!"

Chu Xiaoye could not help but flare up.

"What's so big?"

Vilis also ate her fruit and walked over curiously.

Chu Xiaoye hurriedly squatted on the ground and quickly put on his pants. He said angrily, "Get lost\!"

Vilis walked over and laughed as she ate her fruit. "Shortie, it's not like I haven't seen it before. Why are you shy? Stand up and let Lady Vilis see how big you are."

Chu Xiaoye put on his pants and stood up.

"So… so big\!"

The fruit in Vilis' hand fell to the ground and even the huge sword that had never left her hand fell. She opened her mouth and widened her eyes, looking petrified.

Only Denise was still standing not far away. She only looked over and did not come over.

"Only Denise is a proper and good girl\! You little elves are all lechers\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked down on him as he quickly put on his shirt.

Fei'er walked in front of him in disbelief and said, "Lord… Lord Night, how did you do it?"

The current Lord Night was actually a head taller than her.

Chu Xiaoye tied his belt and was thinking about this.

However, he soon thought of a possibility.

It was very likely because of the black-haired lion\!

The skills he obtained might not be any other combat skills but long skills.

The huge size of the black-haired lion explained everything.

"Short… shorty, how did you do that?"

Vilis abandoned her beloved sword and leaned over, looking at him with a burning gaze. Her face was red. Clearly, she was not only shocked, but also excited.

Since this short man could grow taller, she could definitely grow taller too\!

"By eating beef\!"

Chu Xiaoye said casually as he hung the sword at his waist.

When the huge sword loli heard this, she was stunned for a moment. Then, she staggered a few steps back and said with a trembling voice, "Re… Really?"

She already believed it.

Because they had always been together. Before coming down, he was still so short when he did not transform. After coming down, he had never eaten anything except for a lot of beef. Then, when he transformed again, he suddenly grew taller.

"How… how much do you need to eat?"

The huge sword loli was excited and uneasy.

Chu Xiaoye patted his stomach and said casually, "At least fifty kilograms. Anyway, I ate quite a bit just now. Why, Shortie, are you preparing to eat too?"

"I… I don't want to eat it\!"

Vilis' face turned red and she still said proudly, "I'm a girl. I don't care about height\! Only you beasts can eat those food. I'm a pure and noble elf. I won't eat those dirty food even if I die\!"

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and rubbed Fei'er's head, then the Queen's. He said happily, "Let's go and continue to eat fruits."

He became taller and more handsome, so his mood was naturally better.

Fei'er and Lanisi followed behind him on the left and right. They looked at his tall back and were in a daze, as if they were in a dream.

"Eh, where's Vilis?"

They ate fruits for a while, and Lanisi suddenly realized that Vilis was gone.

"Nice\!"

Chu Xiaoye praised as he ate the fruits.

At this moment, our Lady Vilis was kneeling in front of the water buffalo's corpse and lying on its back. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth to quickly move. She bit her mouth until it was covered in blood and juice. At the same time, she let out a roar, as if she was a cub.

Catherine lay at the side and was dumbfounded.
