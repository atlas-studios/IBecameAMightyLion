Chapter 300: The Rebel Tilly

"Bam\!"

Chu Xiaoye deliberately made way.

Tilly was caught off guard and fell to the ground. Soon, she got up again and leaned on Catherine. She continued to grin and show a love-struck expression.

Catherine stood there motionless, like a stone sculpture.

The tense atmosphere of the two teams seemed to have eased a little under this small interlude.

The golden-haired lion king, Haas, was polite and did not get any response from Chu Xiaoye.

However, he did not seem to be angry. He still looked friendly and mighty as he expressed his intentions in a friendly manner.

He hoped to bring his team to camp outside this border and build a new territory that bordered Chu Xiaoye's territory.

"In this way, if those black lions attack, we can work together to kill the enemy. Furthermore, we can be the vanguard."

Haas looked at Chu Xiaoye sincerely, hoping to get his permission.

His eyes were bright and sincere, and he looked righteous.

It sounded like Chu Xiaoye had no reason to refuse.

First, they did not invade their territory, second, they did not provoke them, and third, they could be their barrier. Why not?

But.

This way, all the prides that wandered from the grassland would join the other party's team first. Only if the other party did not want them would it be their turn.

In other words, with the passage of time, this golden-haired lion king's team would become stronger and stronger, and his team would stay in place and even become weaker.

Furthermore, the nearby herbivore resources would be quickly exhausted.

Chu Xiaoye could think of this, but it did not mean that every member of the team behind him would think of this.

With such a large group of allies suddenly appearing and willing to camp at the front to resist the black lions for them, they were naturally extremely happy.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he had no choice now.

The other party looked polite and asked for his opinion first. Actually, he had already steeled his heart to stay here.

Even if he did not agree, so what?

Could it be that he really wanted to encourage the team behind him to fight them?

At that time, there would be heavy casualties and both sides would be injured. They would still be the unlucky ones. Even the members of the pride of the cold father would be doomed.

Furthermore, he did not seem to be in the right. They did not invade his territory and did not snatch food in his territory. Why should he not agree?

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye had no choice.

He had already marked the scent at the border. It was too late to expand it.

He did not answer and agreed silently.

Haas was very happy. He thanked her politely and raised his hind legs in front of everyone, scattering urine at the border, leaving his scent.

From today onwards, this was the border of their territory\!

When a lion peed, it would sometimes raise its hind legs and sprinkle it on the vegetation at a slanted angle. Sometimes, it would sprinkle it on the ground from behind. Now, this was all grass and there were no vegetation. It could only sprinkle it from behind.

However, this golden-haired lion king kept raising its hind legs to pee.

Chu Xiaoye grinned and turned his head to look at Tilly beside him.

The little white lion had already fallen on Catherine's body. It closed its eyes and seemed to have fainted from excitement.

To be honest, Chu Xiaoye did not suspect anything from the infatuated look on the little white lion's face at the beginning. After all, many young girls were the same. Their brains had yet to develop completely, so they always liked to do some stupid actions.

But now, this little white lion's performance was too exaggerated and made him feel embarrassed.

Obviously, this little white lion was indeed very interested in this golden-haired lion king, but as for what she was interested in, he did not know.

"Roar—"

He growled at One-Eye and Lars.

Since the other party had no intention of invading their territory, they would disperse.

However, he could not let his guard down in this situation.

From today onwards, Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, Jerry, and the Chino brothers would follow him and Little Curly Tail and patrol this territory, always paying attention to the pride outside the border.

The act of killing one another was happening every day in the animal world.

He naturally could not trust this team that had suddenly arrived.

The sun soon set.

Tonight, Little Curly Tail, Molly, Blue Eyes, and the Chino brothers would patrol together.

The other members were in the bushes and could receive them at any time.

After dark.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes and prepared to go to the orchard to find some fruits to eat.

Just as he walked into the orchard, Belia jumped out of the grass at the side with a roar. She narrowed her eyes and wagged her butt at him charmingly.

Chu Xiaoye was already immune to this female leopard's teasing. He ignored it and quickly climbed up a fruit tree.

When Belia saw this, she immediately climbed up and lay beside him. She wagged her tail and let out a pitiful cry, as if she was complaining about his sins.

"Your territory doesn't even have a male leopard. You deliberately let your subordinates chase them away and not let them approach here, right? Hmph, they have long guessed your bad intentions. You want to enjoy us sisters alone, right?"

Belia howled as she twisted her body and rubbed against him.

At this moment, Little Curly Tail suddenly ran in from the grassland outside and came under the fruit tree. He raised his head and let out an anxious cry.

"Brother, I just saw that little white lion secretly cross the border to find that golden retriever\! That female cub must have rebelled\!"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment before his expression turned grave.

Little Curly Tail was furious to see his brother unhappy.

"Damn it\! Beautiful female lions are indeed unreliable\! Brother, don't be sad. It's just one less harem. I'll go over tonight and help Brother snatch a few more back\!"

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs and turned to leave.

Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped down from the tree. Just as he was about to follow him over to take a look, he suddenly thought of something and hurriedly turned around to look around.

Where was Catherine?

That girl had always been inseparable from him. Why did she suddenly disappear?

He thought carefully. When the sky turned dark, Catherine seemed to have disappeared. She seemed to have left with Tilly.

Could it be that the two of them were together?

He did not believe that Tilly would betray him. As for Catherine, there was no need to mention her.

He knew very well how loyal the female cub was to him.

"Roar—"

He suddenly thought of something and immediately roared, charging out of the bushes with Little Curly Tail.

At the same time.

In the night, on Haas's newly established territory, a white figure was swaggering towards the camp of the pride.

Behind her, another figure followed silently.
