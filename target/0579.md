Chapter 579: One-eyed Lion King

"Something's wrong\!"

The hunting dogs fled in fear. The few humans riding horses immediately became vigilant and aimed their shotguns at the bushes and the rock hill.

"Fire\! Scare that animal out\!"

A human shouted.

Then, with a bang, sparks flew and a series of bullets hit the sparse bushes.

However, the bushes were still as quiet as before. Nothing ran out.

"There's a rocky hill there. Many animals like to hide in the caves there. There must be ferocious beasts hiding inside. We have to dismount and walk over."

"No, beware of venomous snakes. If there are leopards hiding in the bushes, we won't have the time to react. Leopards are ambushing experts."

"Forget it, let's wait until dawn. There might be a group of ferocious beasts hiding inside. We can't take the risk. Let's go elsewhere first."

The few humans discussed outside the bushes before leaving resentfully.

They did not know that there was a lion inside that could actually understand their conversation.

When the humans hunting animals left, Chu Xiaoye immediately called out all the members and ordered Catherine and Little Curly Tail to leave and set off.

He would follow behind and send them a distance. At least he had to stay away from this group of humans with shotguns.

Catherine and Little Curly Tail did not dare to hesitate. They immediately brought the pride out of the bushes and left in a hurry in the still dark night.

Chu Xiaoye followed behind and only stopped after sending out the river behind the towering tree.

Catherine and Little Curly Tail also stopped.

All the members of the pride stopped.

The two sides looked at each other from across the river. They did not roar or move. Everything was in their vision.

"Let's go."

Chu Xiaoye looked at Catherine.

Catherine did not hesitate anymore. She retracted her gaze, turned around, and walked in front.

Little Curly Tail looked at him reluctantly and turned around to leave with the pride.

Aisha looked back at him one last time, her eyes filled with love and gentleness.

Chu Xiaoye stood by the river and watched their backs gradually disappear into the distance. All sorts of feelings suddenly surged in his heart.

The night gradually retreated and the sun peeked out.

Chu Xiaoye did not return to the rocky hill. Instead, he entered the bushes here and climbed up the withered towering tree.

The pterodactyl on it was long gone, and the poisonous bees did not leave any traces. The mucus on the tree trunk was also scraped clean, and even the bark was peeled away.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the canopy and looked over. He could still see the gradually shrinking figures of Catherine and the others.

Other than the pride, there were also all sorts of animals that started to migrate into the distance.

The barrier that was opened was the last hope of the animals on the grassland. The animals that were lucky to pass would continue to live and reproduce, and the animals that did not walk there might only be extinct with this world.

Only when the sky turned dark did he get down from the huge tree.

His body was too big and his entire body was golden. If he walked on the grassland during the day, he would definitely be the most striking target. Therefore, he could only move at night.

He needed to find those humans and follow them. Perhaps he could find where the animals that were killed and captured went.

"Bang\!"

In the distant night, a gunshot suddenly came.

Chu Xiaoye's gaze froze. He quickened his steps and walked over.

Humans hunted every night, but they would not kill them quickly because he needed to continue this entertainment.

There would only be more and more animals forced to the grassland from all over the world.

Humans were still making their last desperate struggle. They definitely had many more settlements that had not been attacked by those monsters. And this grassland and many other remote places that humans had previously been unwilling to step foot in had now become their backs.

For example, glaciers, mountains, seas, islands, and all sorts of forests and grassland.

The cities and countries near these places should be their last stronghold.

They still did not despair.

They had powerful weapons, developed brains, and occasional unity. They felt that they could still win this war.

The monsters and viruses wreaked havoc in the prosperous city, occupying the place where humans used to live and destroying it. Now, they were spreading outwards, wanting to kill humans.

The battle between the two sides had already lasted for a long time.

The territory of humans decreased.

Those monsters were almost pervasive. Humans, animals, birds, and even insects could help them continue to be infected with viruses and spread them in the most developed places.

Therefore, many powerful weapons of humans were forced to land or be destroyed. This calamity came too suddenly and quickly for humans to react. They could only use the lightest guns and bullets to escape and resist.

They fled to those poor countries and cities, wanting to continue developing technology and weapons and research weapons to deal with those monsters. However, the monsters were chasing too tightly, giving them no time or opportunity.

Now, the slightly larger cities were occupied by monsters.

Almost all creatures had become their slaves and accomplices.

Pet dogs, birds, pigs, cows, sheep, chickens, ducks, fish, and even some potted plants and plants caught all humans off guard.

Therefore, the humans guarding the city were all in danger. They only believed the humans beside them and not any other creatures.

In addition to killing animals for entertainment, the humans at the back were also capturing animals and injecting certain genes into them, making them stronger and more violent. They were preparing to use these animals to resist the monsters.

Of course, Chu Xiaoye did not know these.

He did not want to know.

The only thing he had to do now was to save the cold father and Mei Mei. Then, he would leave this place and never return.

The world here was about to collapse. Chu Xiaoye did not think that those monsters could do it. It was very possible that humans, who knew that they were about to die, suddenly made up their minds to die with those monsters and released weapons that were enough to destroy the Earth.

He believed that humans had this ability.

Humans were the most qualified and most likely to destroy this world.

The gunshots ahead were still echoing. There should be more than one animal killed.

Chu Xiaoye walked over under the night and dense withered grass and saw three humans riding horses. They were running and shooting with the guns in their hands.

A strong smell of blood came.

A few female lions and young cubs fell into a pool of blood.

The remaining female lions and young cubs hid in the bushes, trembling.

A lion protected them. Its huge head popped out of the bushes and it bared its fangs, letting out a fierce and terrified roar.

The three humans gathered together and walked over slowly with their guns raised.

"What a big lion\! This can't be killed. It's anesthetized. Bring it back and let the doctor inject it."

The three humans discussed for a moment before one of them took out an anesthetic gun.

"Roarâ€”"

The huge lion seemed to know what was about to happen and let out a roar that it did not dare to roar.

This roar did not scare the three humans, but it made Chu Xiaoye, who was hiding 100 meters away, tremble\!

This voice was very familiar. He had heard it many times.

Chu Xiaoye stood up, his eyes flickering with golden light as he looked over.

A blind lion with a scarred face\!

It was Blue Eyes\!
