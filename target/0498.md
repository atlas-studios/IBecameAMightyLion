Chapter 498: Elven Queen

In the palace, in the arena.

The round arena made of boulders was like a mini version of the ancient Roman Colosseum. In the middle was a wide-open space with neat open seats around it. There were also many exquisite stone houses dedicated to protecting the nobles.

When Chu Xiaoye and the others followed the palace guards here, the honorable elf queen was sitting in the luxuriously decorated stone house, munching on melon seeds and watching the performance on the ground. Her slender face covered in powder was filled with excitement.

In the open space, a mutated bull with a fiery red body and three sharp horns on its head was fighting an orc to the death.

The orc had horns on his forehead, green skin, and fangs. He held a spear and was rather agile. He had already pierced many bloody holes in the furious bull.

The bull was dripping with blood, but it was still fierce and strong. Not only was its movements not affected, it became even more ferocious and violent.

"Bang\!"

The orc was not careful and was suddenly sent flying by the crazy bull, landing heavily on the ground.

"Alright\!"

The Queen praised him generously and looked very excited.

When Vilis brought Chu Xiaoye to her side, she did not seem to have realized it, or perhaps she had already seen it. However, she did not have the time to care about them.

Vilis stood at the side and looked at the arena below, waiting patiently.

Everyone knew that it was best not to disturb the Queen when she was in the mood to watch the competition.

The bull's hooves fluttered as it lowered its head and charged angrily at the fallen orc, preparing to give it a fatal blow.

The Queen stopped eating melon seeds and even got up slightly. She widened her eyes and looked down.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this last moment, the fallen orc suddenly turned around and got up. He suddenly pushed the spear in his hand forward and pierced it into the bull's eye\!

The Fighting Bull's charging speed was fast, fierce, and extremely strong. This was equivalent to sending his eyeballs towards the sharp spear tip\!

The spear pierced through its eyeball and into its brain\!

The moment it hit the orc, the orc immediately let go of his spear and rolled on the ground to dodge.

"Boom\!"

The bull fell to the ground and struggled violently, but it could not stand up again.

The orc got up from the ground and walked over covered in blood. He held the spear with both hands and pulled the spear out of its eyeball with all his might. Then, he pierced it fiercely into its neck.

The bull twitched a few times and died completely.

This battle finally came to an end.

According to the rules, the orcs who won the battle would be free.

The orcs were captured by the elves. They were considered brave to be able to regain their freedom in this way.

The orc threw down his spear, raised his head, and looked at the sky. He raised his fist and let out a roar to celebrate his victory.

The Queen's expression instantly darkened.

She continued to eat melon seeds and treated Vilis, who was greeting her from the side, as air.

The atmosphere was a little awkward.

"Whoosh â€”"

Right at this moment, an arrow suddenly shot out from beside the Queen and accurately pierced into the orc's eyeball\!

The orc's body trembled and swayed a few times. He widened his eyes and fell to the ground.

At this moment, the Queen's stiff mouth moved slightly.

However, she turned around and looked at the silver-armored girl standing beside her. She frowned and said slightly reproachfully, "Denise, how could you break the rules?"

The elven girl named Denise lowered her head and did not speak.

She was very tall, nearly 1.76 meters. She was considered tall in the elves' world. Her silver hair was braided and spread behind her. Her silver tight armor outlined her perfect figure.

Her face was cold like an ice sculpture in a snow forest. She was carrying a crystal bow made of unknown materials and had an ancient curved blade at her slender waist.

To be able to carry these weapons beside the Queen, her identity was clearly extraordinary.

Even Vilis had to put down her inseparable sword before she came to the queen.

The queen was wearing a gorgeous purple robe and a crown covered in gems. She was graceful and noble.

She finally turned around and looked at Vilis in front of her. As if she had just discovered something, she said in surprise, "Yo, Vilis, when did you come? Why are you standing here? Come and sit beside me. You're the main character tonight."

As she spoke, her smiling but dignified gaze looked behind her.

"A furless lion?"

The queen looked surprised, then smiled. "As long as you're strong, even if you're not wearing clothes, who would dare to laugh at you? Don't you think so, Denise?"

Denise did not look at Chu Xiaoye or speak. She only lowered her head slightly.

"Oh, I forgot again. Denise, you're a mute. You've been a mute since you were young. Sorry."

The Queen's face was apologetic. Then, she looked at the captain of the guards who was standing respectfully at the side and asked, "Viscount Boren, are the others here?"

Viscount Boren looked up and replied respectfully, "Your Majesty, the time is not up yet. They're probably rushing here."

"Go and rush them."

The Queen could not wait.

Viscount Boren hurriedly left and informed the other palace guards to welcome and urge him.

In the arena below, the servants were cleaning the corpses and blood on the ground.

The Queen suddenly looked at Vilis and smiled. "I'll give you the corpse of that orc, my Lady Vilis. It tastes good. I've always wanted you to try it, but you probably haven't eaten it yet. This time, you have to try it."

Vilis lowered her head and acknowledged.

Annie, who was standing behind, turned pale and looked at the arena below with trembling eyes.

Before coming here, she received news that it was nothing.

The elves were a noble and pure tribe, and the Elf Kingdom was a united and kind country. The elves here were all modest, kind, pure, and beautiful, and they were equally kind to any species.

But now, what she saw was completely different.

Obviously, she had been deceived.

The person who deceived her was not Vilis, but the high priest of the elves who had spent a lot of energy to establish a connection with her.

Of course, she was not the only one who was deceived.

Annie looked pitifully at her king.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was looking at Catherine, who was behind him.

They only looked at each other and confirmed many things.

Catherine was trembling, not in fear.

She had never been afraid beside him.

Chu Xiaoye quietly raised his tail and rubbed her chin, as if he was comforting her.

The strong smell of blood filled the entire arena.

A fiery red pterodactyl cut through the sky and flew out of the clouds.
