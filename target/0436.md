Chapter 436: Untitled

The night was silent.

Even the sounds of lions eating not far away seemed to be much quieter.

Although Chu Xiaoye's gaze was still questioning, his restless body was already starting to feel a little impatient.

He hated that his uncontrollable instincts had already become like this.

Alisa looked conflicted.

His amber eyes were burning hot in the dark night, then cold as a knife, and then extremely embarrassed, as if he was secretly cursing his unscrupulous and dirty thoughts.

This smelly gangster's words sounded very tempting.

Thinking of the scene he described, thinking of taking this powerful pride for herself, and thinking of making this smelly gangster kneel and lick her, Alisa's mouth was overflowing with saliva.

These conditions were too lethal\!

She was about to nod and almost got up to curl her tail and let him do whatever he wanted\!

However, in this way, would her great and heroic dream, her pride as a queen that could not be blasphemed, still be dazzling, filled with glory, and honorable?

Did he only care about the outcome and not the process?

If she knew about Wu Zetian, the great empress, perhaps she would immediately let go and make a choice. Even humans did not feel that they were dirty and despicable, let alone wild beasts.

Unfortunately, she did not know that there was such a pioneer.

The pride of a lion, the glory of her dreams, and the dignity of a queen made her unable to make such a decision.

She would rather die\!

Dreams were not out of reach, but if she wanted to compromise for her dream and become a female lion that made herself feel ashamed, she might as well not dream.

She indeed yearned for the queen's position day and night, but she hoped to obtain it with her own ability and not sell her soul and dignity.

If she lost her dignity as a queen, what was the point of becoming one?

At the thought of this, Alisa's gaze became even more determined.

She bared her fangs again and glared, fiercely expressing her intentions. "Scram\!"

Chu Xiaoye was clearly stunned for a moment and looked at her strangely.

The female cub did not listen to reason and would rather die than submit. This was beyond his expectations.

This intelligence and spirit was not something an animal should have.

Although he was very anxious, he would never dare to act rashly without the permission of this female cub.

Unless he could restrain the other party's terrifying tail.

"Whoosh—"

Unexpectedly, right at this moment, a figure suddenly rushed out from behind the tree and bit Alisa's tail\!

Alisa and Chu Xiaoye were shocked.

When Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the familiar black eyes and the expressionless face, the corner of his mouth twitched and his face was filled with shock.

Catherine lowered her head and bit Alisa's tail tightly, looking a little guilty.

She hated this lioness, but she hoped that the king would get his wish. This way, the king's male instincts would be developed and he would be unable to stop mating.

Then, she…

Alisa finally started to panic. She started to twist her body and struggle with all her might, her eyes filled with anger and fear.

The tail which was the only thing she could use to protect herself from being violated had already been bitten by Catherine. Being pressed to the ground like this, she could only be slaughtered by this smelly gangster and could not resist.

She hated it\!

However, Chu Xiaoye did not make his next move for a long time.

Catherine's kindness did not help him. Instead, it ruined his mood and made the desire in his heart and the instincts of his body quickly fade.

What he hid in his bones was still the thoughts of humans and he still had the shame of humans.

How could he do anything when another pair of eyes were looking at him from behind?

However, he was unwilling to let go of the stubborn and despicable lioness cub under him.

He lowered his head and leaned close to Alisa's face. He stuck out his tongue and licked it a few times. Then, he grinned like a baddie and let go of his claws. He quickly jumped away to prevent the female cub from attacking out of embarrassment.

Alisa was already in despair, and tears flowed from her eyes. Now, she saw him suddenly let go of her claws and jump away from her. She was stunned and could not react. She looked at him in a daze.

Catherine, who was biting her tail, was also a little stunned and at a loss. She still bit her tail and did not let go.

Chu Xiaoye glared at her and told her to stop.

Catherine let go of her mouth, not knowing that she had done something wrong out of kindness. She looked confused, but her heart was filled with disappointment and worry.

"Sigh, I failed again… King, can you still not do it?"

If Chu Xiaoye knew what she was thinking now, he would definitely go over and test it out on her personally\!

To be honest, Catherine was indeed the most suitable experimental subject. However, this was the female cub Chu Xiaoye had raised since she was young. Their relationship was extraordinary and he could not bear to treat her as a test subject.

Furthermore, the beautiful grassland in front of them was waving at them.

He was about to invade the territories of other prides and occupy a new home, giving the prides that had followed him for so long a place to stay.

How could he make a move on Catherine at this time?

No one could replace Catherine's important role and loyalty.

If she accidentally got pregnant, it would be troublesome. With this female cub's stubborn personality, she would definitely fight alongside him until the end no matter what and might even pay with her life.

Chu Xiaoye would never allow such a thing to happen.

As for the other lioness cub, it did not matter.

She did not have any feelings for the pride. When her life was in danger, it was definitely more important to escape first. Therefore, even if she accidentally got pregnant, Chu Xiaoye had nothing to worry about.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye had no feelings for her. Even if he had skin contact and the other party suddenly died tragically, Chu Xiaoye would not be sad.

Therefore, she was the most suitable test subject.

Unfortunately, the good show tonight was ruined by Catherine, who suddenly barged in.

If Catherine had not appeared, Chu Xiaoye definitely had other ways to make this lioness cub surrender.

It was just a tail. At most, he would break it first\!

Chu Xiaoye looked fiercely at the lioness cub that was still lying on the ground in a daze. He swore inwardly. The next night will be the time you bow down and beg for mercy\! Just wait\!

Alisa finally woke up. She turned around and got up from the ground. She bared her fangs at Chu Xiaoye and roared softly, but a shadow fell on her heart.

It turned out that this smelly gangster still had not given up on her\! He even instructed the fart worm to deal with her\!

Damn it\!

For the first time, Alisa started to waver in her decision to stay in this pride.

Wasn't this walking into a wolf's trap?

At this moment, this lioness, who was determined to be a queen and was fearless, suddenly started to be afraid. She even felt that she was like a pitiful little sheep that could be slaughtered by this despicable, despicable, and cunning smelly hooligan at any time.

However, giving up halfway and retreating in fear was not her style.

Since she wanted to rule the world and become a queen, she naturally had to face the difficulty\!

For now, she could only take action first\!

First, defeat this smelly gangster in front of the pride and plant the seed that she was the strongest and most suitable to be a leader in the hearts of all the members. Then, use her powerful strength and the queen's dominance to make them submit willingly\!

"Roar—"

After taking revenge, she decided to take action. Alisa immediately roared and attracted the attention of the pride. Then, facing the gazes of all the members, she officially issued a challenge to Chu Xiaoye\!

Challenges from the same pride were not rare.

Even two brothers and father and son often fought to obtain the priority to mate with a female lion.

The victor mated and the loser cried.

A duel was common for them.

However, in the same pride, a female lion actually wanted to challenge a lion. Furthermore, this lion was the lion king of this pride. This was a little strange and absurd.

Alisa's roar attracted all the members of the pride.

Everyone surrounded him with stunned and puzzled expressions. They did not know what meaning this battle had.

Even if she won, so what?

A pride was not a hyena pack. They would never let a lioness become a lion king.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye was not just a lion king to them. He was also their spiritual support and faith.

No matter the outcome, they would not betray this young lion king that had saved their lives countless times and fought alongside them countless times.

Unfortunately, Alisa did not understand.

Alisa only knew that all animals and all tribes worshipped the strong, especially a lion pride. Only the strongest could make the members of the pride submit and rely on them willingly.

Of course, after observing along the way, she still knew a little.

Therefore, she was not in a hurry to make them submit. She only needed to defeat this smelly gangster in front of them first and make them not dare to covet her body again. She wanted everyone to know that she, Alisa, was the strongest in this pride\!

Only by doing this could she let these proud members slowly accept her and pay attention to her. From then on, they would unconsciously center on her.

This way, things would be much easier.

Alisa praised her intelligence and schemes and could not help but grin.

"Roar—"

She hurriedly roared again, stabilized her mind, and looked provocatively at the smelly rogue again\!

Come\! Let this Queen's sharp claws tear apart your wretched and ugly face\!

Catherine stood up and revealed a cold killing intent in her eyes, preparing to accept her challenge.

Chu Xiaoye took a few steps forward, extended his claws, and patted her Catherine's head to let her go. Then, he looked at the fighting spirit of the female cub in front of him with a burning gaze and smiled.

"Since we're going to fight, there has to be a prize, right? What if This King wins?"

Alisa narrowed her eyes and looked at him hatefully. She knew what this smelly gangster wanted. It must be her slender, beautiful, and pure body\!

Dirty\!

However, the arrow was already on the bow and she had no choice but to attack\!

Furthermore, she was very confident in her strength\!

Even if she had to take the risk, she had no choice.

If she wanted to become the supreme queen, it was impossible not to take the risk\!

Success or failure depended on this\!

"If you win, I'll do whatever you want me to\! If you lose, you have to be obedient when you see me in the future\!"

Alisa agreed without fear. Her amber eyes glistened as she looked at him bravely and domineeringly.

"Alright\!"

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and praised her courage, but he sighed inwardly. He racked his brains but could not find a way to get it. God was helping him, making him completely a lion.

Then, let's do it\!

When Alisa saw him agree without hesitation, her heart inexplicably trembled when he looked at her. She felt a little… flustered.
