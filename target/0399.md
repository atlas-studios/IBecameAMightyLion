Chapter 399: Black Bear King

The Black Bear Spirit roared as it came.

After running close to the pride, its huge and majestic body suddenly stood up and let out a deafening roar. It looked even more ferocious and terrifying\!

The Chino brothers almost peed their pants.

The other members of the pride looked at the tall, strong, and extremely fierce figure in front of them and were rather nervous.

The tall mixed fur, blue eyes, and the Jerry brothers looked much shorter and weaker than the standing black bear.

The black bear bared its fangs and brandished its claws. It roared continuously, but it did not attack immediately.

Its meaning was obvious. "Those who submit to me will prosper and those who resist will die\! Only by submitting to me and becoming my king will you survive\!"

It wanted to take this pride for its own use\!

The lions following behind it immediately pretended to be majestic and roared proudly, urging Chu Xiaoye's pride to surrender immediately\!

However, no one bothered with them.

The black bear king was furious. He swung his claws and ordered the two lions behind him to teach these blind little things a lesson.

The two lions relied on their backing and immediately roared angrily, pouncing on Chu Xiaoye.

Before Chu Xiaoye could attack, Little Curly Tail, who was behind him, had already rushed up impatiently. He swung his tail and slapped the two strong lions until their heads tilted and they fell to the ground.

The two lions crawled on the ground with stunned expressions. The roars in their mouths stopped abruptly. Their mouths were full of blood and they were dizzy. They could not get up for a long time.

"Roar\!"

When the Black Bear King saw this scene, he was furious. He bared his fangs and let out a deafening roar again, looking even more terrifying\!

"Bang\!"

Little Curly Tail's iron whip-like long tail suddenly swung and slapped the rock beside him, causing the rock to crack\!

Then, he wagged his tail, his eyes shining as he walked towards the Black Bear King excitedly.

"Roar\!"

The Black Bear King let out a deafening roar again and used almost all his strength. In the end, because he used too much strength, his butt let out a puff and he farted.

Just as Little Curly Tail was about to walk close, a scene that stunned all the lions appeared\!

The huge black bear king stood up and let out a terrifying roar again. Then, it started to roar and retreat\!

This tall, fierce, and extremely powerful fellow was actually a coward\!

The female lions following behind him were even more shocked when they saw this scene. They looked at each other and were at a loss.

As for the two lions lying on the ground, they were stunned, as if they regretted being defeated without fighting last night and surrendering\!

This coward had roared so loudly and revealed such a fierce expression. It turned out that he was only bluffing and hiding his timidity and timidity\!

When Little Curly Tail saw this, he immediately felt bored. He immediately roared angrily and told the other party to stop retreating and fight quickly\!

"Roar\!"

The Black Bear continued to roar angrily. As he retreated, he turned to look at the female lions behind him and urged them to attack first.

The gazes of the female lions had already changed from reverence to disdain and disdain. They immediately growled, turned around, and ran, never playing with it again.

The two lions lying on the ground took the opportunity to get up and quickly run down the mountain.

Obviously, they were no match for this pride and did not have any hatred for this pride. As for that coward, let it fend for itself\!

The defection of his subordinates made the already guilty and afraid Black Bear King even more flustered.

Seeing that Little Curly Tail's eyes were shining and he was pressing forward step by step, the Black Bear King hurriedly lowered his upper body and landed on all fours. He stopped roaring and his fierce expression changed to a guilty warning. "Kid, don't hold me back from flipping out\!"

As he warned, he continued to retreat.

Little Curly Tail could not wait for it to flare up and continue to press forward, baring his teeth and provoking it.

A hint of panic finally appeared in the Black Bear King's eyes. He turned around and looked. Just as he was about to escape, he suddenly realized that there was a figure behind him at some point in time.

It was another young lion. The mane on its neck was golden and more dazzling than the setting sun on the horizon.

The Black Bear King was furious. It immediately turned around and raised its claws. With a bang, it suddenly slapped the ground, shattering the few rocks on the ground.

Its claws trembled slightly and it grinned in pain.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye also raised his claws and slapped a rock beside him. The rock shattered on the spot\!

The black bear king's body trembled and he stopped in his tracks. He looked at him timidly, then turned around and looked at Little Curly Tail behind him with a bitter expression.

At this moment, Mixed Fur, Blue Eyes, and the Jerry brothers surrounded them on the left and right.

The other lions were also roaring and cheering from behind.

He had wanted to rely on his huge body and ferocious aura to win again without a fight and take in another wave of subordinates, the Black Bear King. At this moment, it was too late for regrets. Not only did he lose his previous wave of subordinates, he could not even save his life now.

"Roarâ€¦"

The majestic big black bear suddenly let out a whimper like a cat. It immediately lowered its eyes and crawled on the ground, begging for mercy.

"Spare me, good man\!"

The domineering aura of "I opened this mountain and planted this tree" at the beginning suddenly turned into the current "good man spare me". It only took a moment and from the beginning to the end, they had never officially fought. This coward's adaptability made Chu Xiaoye not know whether to laugh or cry.

Little Curly Tail was disappointed and angry. He slapped its butt with his tail and roared for it to stand up and fight.

It was not easy for him to get someone who looked like he could fight, but in the end, he was a coward. He did not even have the addiction to one move. How could he not be angry?

The Black Bear King's butt had been slapped, but he no longer had his previous temper. He turned his head, grinned, and fawned.

Little Curly Tail expected better from him and was no longer interested in this coward. He flicked his claws and bared his fangs. He glared fiercely and waited for his brother's orders.

Chu Xiaoye did not have any killing intent towards this Black Bear King.

It was not easy to grow up like this. Since he admitted defeat, he would let him go.

The heavens were benevolent, and this lion king was not someone who killed the innocent.

Just as he was about to leave with the team, he suddenly stopped and looked at the little girl following behind. Then, he turned around and looked at the black bear king in front of him.

Seeing him look over, the black bear king immediately opened his mouth and lowered his body. The short tail behind him was like the tail of a puppy. It swayed with all its might, looking harmless and obedient.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye flicked his golden claw and walked towards the black bear king again.
