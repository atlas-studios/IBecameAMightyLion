Chapter 84: The Light of Hatred

The night was dark and the wind was dry.

At this moment, a rare riot was happening in the hyena camp.

The three wandering male hyenas had turned over ten male hyenas of this hyena pack and were attacking the hyena queen fiercely.

The hyena queen was shocked and furious. She hurriedly brought the female hyenas of her species and counterattacked ferociously.

But.

One of the wandering male hyenas' speed and strength was not something that a hyena could compare to\!

It was like a sharp sword that pierced through the layers of guards and pounced at the hyena queen.

Then, he bit the Queen's neck\!

The tall hyena queen could not resist at all and was pushed to the ground.

The chaotic hyenas instantly quietened down.

When Chu Xiaoye took advantage of the night and rushed over, the battle had already ended.

Baley bit the hyena queen's neck and raised his head, looking coldly and disdainfully at the other hyenas around him.

At this moment.

Be it male or female hyenas, they were all terrified after being stared at by him and kept quiet out of fear\!

Its strength made them afraid and terrified\!

They gave in.

The rules of hyenas usually did not allow male hyenas to be king.

Firstly, it was because the female hyenas were larger and stronger in attack. Secondly, it was because there were the most female hyenas in every hyena pack and they were almost all relatives, with the most supporters.

They rarely left their tribes.

The male hyenas often moved from one tribe to another.

Therefore, male hyenas had no basis as king in their species.

From this, the rules of the hyena matriarchal society slowly formed.

However, at this moment, the hyenas had no choice but to make a decision that violated the rules.

Because this male hyena was clearly stronger.

It could easily rush in front of the Queen and bite her to death under the protection of dozens of female hyenas\!

Then, which female hyena was its match?

Therefore, they could only yield.

From tonight on, their tribe would be led by this male hyena\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The other three wandering male hyenas immediately took the lead in shouting, as if they were congratulating and fawning.

The other hyenas also cried out.

Baley bit the hyena queen's neck and raised his head, proudly accepting the highest honor.

Suddenly, he looked at a male hyena not far away.

They were old acquaintances.

When he was still in this tribe, he was often bullied by this companion.

Now, it was time to take revenge\!

"Whoosh—"

He suddenly rushed over, and before the male hyena could react, he bit its neck\!

This scene shocked the other hyenas\!

The cheers instantly stopped.

Baley did not show mercy and bit the hyena's neck in one bite. Then, he started to eat in front of his companions.

The other hyenas shivered.

Baley's mouth was full of blood. He raised his head and looked at them coldly, his appearance terrifying.

He was not the only one who had bullied him in the past.

Tonight was just the beginning\!

He wanted to take revenge, to take revenge viciously\!

At the same time, he wanted to annex all the hyenas in the vicinity. Then, he would lead the army to kill the lions, occupy their territory, and snatch their food and resources\!

The surrounding prides were all cubs, and to him, they were nothing.

From today onwards, he, Baley, and his hyenas were the true kings of this grassland\!

He wanted to dominate the entire grassland\!

Suddenly, the hot night wind brought with it an unusual smell.

It was the smell of a lion.

Baley suddenly raised his head and looked at the bushes not far away.

Outside the bushes, in the grass, a figure stood up and walked slowly towards the Hyena Camp.

He walked so calmly.

It was like he was taking a walk at the camp.

It was indeed a lion.

However, it was only an underage cub\!

Baley narrowed his eyes and looked surprised. He felt that it was strange and unbelievable.

Was this little thing stupid from drinking milk? Did it treat the hyena camp as their pride's camp?

The other hyenas turned their heads and looked at the figure, feeling stunned and in disbelief.

Was this cub tired of living and coming to seek death?

Suddenly, some hyenas recognized the young cub\!

Back then, this young cub had attacked their queen and killed their companions in front of them\!

This young cub was their nightmare\!

Baley and the two wandering male hyenas he had brought did not seem to know how powerful this young cub was.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

"Hehehehehehe…"

The three wandering male hyenas immediately let out sharp and strange laughter and ran towards the young cub together.

They ran as if they were flying, fighting to be the first\!

They had to show their courage and strength in front of all the female hyenas\!

From today onwards, the hyenas would belong to the male hyenas\!

The male was respected, and the female was inferior\!

They bared their sharp fangs and pounced at the young cub with a fierce expression, preparing to kill it with one move\!

That strange cry seemed to be mocking the young cub. "Little thing, quickly extend your neck and let me bite you\! Just like how your two newly born sisters were previously\!"

"Whoosh\!"

A golden light suddenly lit up in the night\!

Like a meteor, it flashed in front of them\!

The young cub suddenly passed by them and stood behind them\!

Its speed was indescribable\!

The male hyena at the front suddenly tilted its body and fell to the ground with a thud.

Blood sprayed and his body twitched.

He did not make any sounds.

Only half of its head was left on its neck\!

As for the other half, it was dripping with blood as it hung on the cub's right claw\!

"..."

The shouting stopped\!

The remaining two male hyenas immediately froze in place. They stared with their eyes wide open as if they had been suddenly immobilized by a spell.

They were almost scared out of their wits\!

In the forest not far away.

Catherine hid in the bushes and looked at the cold and powerful figure with shining eyes. Her body was trembling slightly and her blood was surging. Her eyes were filled with excitement and obsession.

Behind her, on a small tree.

Belita quietly lay on it, widened her eyes, and looked at this terrifying scene in fear\!

Her mother was standing under the tree, trembling in fear.

"Whoosh\!"

The figure suddenly turned around and charged at the remaining two male hyenas\!

He was as fast as lightning\!

His right claw was raised up\!

His cold eyes flickered with a bloodthirsty and ferocious light in the night and under the moonlight\!

It was the light of hatred\!
