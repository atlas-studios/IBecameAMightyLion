Chapter 136: The Lion's Battle

"Roar—"

Chu Xiaoye could not tolerate it anymore and immediately roared at the distant grassland.

Not long after.

About seven to eight elephants rushed over under the lead of a female elephant.

When the leading female elephant saw the small elephant behind him, she immediately raised her nose and cried out angrily. She immediately rushed over aggressively.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to provoke such a super tank in six godly suits.

He immediately turned around and ran into the distance.

To his surprise, the little elephant behind him immediately followed him and jogged.

As for the female elephant in the lead, she stared blankly at the little elephant that ran far away and did not chase after it.

It seemed that she was not the mother of this elephant.

And this elephant herd had nothing to do with this little elephant.

Chu Xiaoye immediately had a headache.

He stopped and looked at the little elephant running with difficulty while shaking its nose. He gritted his teeth and thought, Forget it. I'll have a good sleep tonight and have a sumptuous breakfast of elephant meat tomorrow morning\!

The grassland was endless, desolate and cold. There were almost no other animals.

Not far away, there were a few sparse trees and bushes that were still green. They decorated the withered land with some color.

Chu Xiaoye decided to find a bush and sleep soundly.

The little elephant following behind raised its nose sneakily again and prepared to push his butt.

Chu Xiaoye could not tolerate it anymore. He immediately turned around, took a few steps back, and suddenly dashed towards it. Then, he jumped up and landed on its back.

Then, he mounted it.

"Roar—"

He slapped his big ears with his claws and roared, ordering it to move immediately.

The little elephant was stunned in place.

When Chu Xiaoye slapped its big ears again, it reacted and immediately started walking forward, looking very at ease.

Chu Xiaoye rode on it and looked down from above, looking around in high spirits.

This was what a king should be like\!

When he found a good territory in the future and occupied it as a king, he would catch an elephant as his mount.

At that time, be it patrolling the territory or fighting other prides, he could ride elephants. It was too domineering\!

As for this little elephant, he could not take it for the time being.

He had become a lion that had lost its home and did not even have a territory. He did not even know whether he would have food in the future. How could he dare to rear such a huge monster?

The appetite of an elephant was not something a lion could compare to, let alone be able to eat their fill easily.

They had to eat non-stop everyday for 24 hours a day. They had to eat for at least 16 hours to not go hungry.

Their daily food intake could reach more than 200 kilograms, equivalent to the weight of a female lion.

These food were not heavy meat, but some leaves and grass.

Therefore, they spend almost their entire lives searching for food and eating.

Their huge and strong bodies made them invincible in the grassland. They did not fear any carnivores, but it also made them pay the heavy price of running around for food their entire lives.

There was nothing perfect in this world.

Chu Xiaoye rode his elephant and looked at the vast grassland in front of him, thinking about finding a new home.

He hoped that Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and the others could guard that territory well and wait for him to return.

"Roar—"

A roar suddenly interrupted his thoughts.

This was the roar of a lion\!

The little elephant immediately stopped and raised its nose uneasily.

Under the bushes in front.

A mature lion walked out with three adult female lions. His dark eyes flickered with a hungry and coveting light in the night.

However, when they saw Chu Xiaoye riding on the back of the elephant, they were shocked and looked a little stunned.

A cub riding on an elephant?

They seemed to find it unbelievable.

However, this was their territory and other lions were not allowed to enter.

Furthermore, Chu Xiaoye was a male lion\!

Even a young male cub whose fur was not even fully grown was a serious and unforgivable provocation to the king of this territory\!

"Roar—"

The adult lion roared again.

Then, he brought the three female lions and walked over quickly, surrounding the little elephant and Chu Xiaoye, who was on the elephant's back.

They wanted to expel or kill this little lion and then eat this elephant that was not protected by its herd\!

The little elephant raised its nose and expressed that it was not easy to bully.

Chu Xiaoye rode on the elephant and looked at the pride that was even weaker than the pride of the cold father. He looked at their messy and sorry fur and thin bodies and could not help but feel a little emotional.

At this time, everyone was not having a good time.

However, he would not be polite.

He needed a place to rest now.

The bushes in front were a good place.

It was impossible for him to walk a long distance and find another place.

Furthermore, who knew if the next place would be the territory of another more powerful pride?

He did not have the energy to continue running around.

Therefore, he was determined to stay here\!

However, if he wanted to rest peacefully in the territory of this pride, he had to defeat their king and deter them with his strength.

Furthermore, he had to do so carefully.

Otherwise, if he chased this lion king away and left tomorrow after he woke up, wouldn't the three female lions that had lost their husband and were abandoned by their new husband be miserable?

He did not want to be scummy\!

"Roar—"

The adult lion bared its fangs and looked at him coldly, as if it was asking him to come down and accept the duel.

The wandering lions that invaded the territory mostly coveted this territory and the female lions. Therefore, they had to fight the lion king here.

Chu Xiaoye stretched and obediently jumped down from the elephant's back.

The three female lions did not even look at him in the eye. They even bared their fangs and growled at him, telling him to scram.

They seemed to be saying, "Kid, you haven't even grown your fur yet and you want to defeat our king and occupy us sisters? Dream on\!"

"Whoosh—"

Chu Xiaoye did not waste his breath and rushed towards the adult lion\!

He was very tired and needed to end the battle quickly and rest.

The journey tomorrow was still very difficult.

"Roar—"

When the lion king saw that this kid was actually so arrogant, it immediately raised its upper body and raised its two claws, preparing to slap this kid twice to wake him up.

At this age, he should go back and continue to drink milk and be a good child\!

He actually dared to covet his territory and women. He was courting death\!

"Bam\!"

However, before his two slaps could land, a slap suddenly landed on his face, causing his head to tilt and he fell to the ground\!

He crawled on the ground, his mouth and eyes slanted, and he was dizzy. For a moment, he actually forgot where he was and what he was doing.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of him and raised his right palm. With a bang, he slapped him on the head again\!

This time, he fainted.

The three female lions baring their fangs at the side immediately put away their fangs and stood in place in a daze.
