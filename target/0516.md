Chapter 516: The Little Girl's Request

"Crack\!"

The wooden bridge that was being burned by the flames suddenly let out a sound that was about to break.

Dolma was even more furious after being shot in the wings and the fire pillar it spat out became thicker.

The expressions of the twenty-over orcs changed drastically when they saw that the bridge was about to collapse. They did not dare to hesitate and hurriedly used all their strength to jump towards the only intact third wooden bridge.

Fortunately, the distance between the two wooden bridges was not too far. The twenty orcs all jumped over safely.

"Whoosh\!"

The orc with the huge bow roared and shot another arrow\!

This arrow hit the neck of the fire dragon Dolma.

Dolma cried out in pain, flapped its wings, and flew up, preparing to escape.

"Bam\!"

Right at this moment, the second bridge was completely burned and collapsed by the flames.

The Elven Queen suddenly stood up from Dolma and jumped up. Her red hair fluttered as she jumped onto the third bridge.

Dolma flew into the sky and fled in panic.

Lanisi stood up from the bridge. With a clang, she pulled out the sword at her waist and quickly ran towards the bridge on the side of the canyon.

The twenty-over orcs chased after him and roared angrily.

When Lanisi ran to the bridge, she did not jump up immediately. Instead, she raised the sword in her hand and slashed heavily on the wooden bridge at her feet.

Because the bodies of the orcs were very heavy and there were many of them, when building these three bridges, they were built with very thick ancient trees. Furthermore, many tree trunks were stacked together. No matter how sharp the sword in her hand was, it was difficult to cut it in an instant.

When she cut the wooden bridge under her feet, the twenty-over strong orcs had already roared and pounced on her.

Lanisi gaze was determined and she did not retreat. She swung the sword in her hand and faced it.

Now, every member of the elves was fighting the enemy. Every member had their own mission, and she had hers.

Her mission was to destroy these three bridges, even if she had to pay with her life\!

She was the queen of the elves. This was her honor and responsibility\!

His pupils reflected the flames, and his sword swung out with a cold light. The sound of weapons hitting the bridge sounded, and the roar of the orcs drifted on the cliff. His red hair fluttered like flames, and his beautiful face was dyed with blood.

The queen was still standing upright\!

Finally, after killing the fifth orc, she was stabbed.

At the same time, the arrow flew over and pierced through her arm.

However, she still held her sword tightly and stood at the bridge, unwilling to give in\!

She no longer had the chance or strength to destroy the last bridge under her feet. However, as long as she still had a breath left, she would never let any orc walk past her\!

"Put down the sword in your hand\! Come back with us obediently and we'll spare your life\!"

The remaining orcs were shocked by her heroic spirit and attracted to her beautiful appearance.

When they came here, they saw that their companions in the canyon had clearly failed. The remaining few of them could not rush in at all. Since they were leaving, they naturally had to abduct this beautiful and brave elf girl.

Lanisi did not speak. The sword in her hand was still dripping with blood.

"Whoosh\!"

The orc with the huge bow shot out another arrow and pierced through Lanisi's right leg.

Lanisi's body swayed and she pushed her sword against the ground, still not falling.

"Alright, Nuha, stop shooting\! This red-haired elf is riding a fire dragon. She's clearly a noble of the elves. She might be the flaming princess of the elves\! Don't hurt such beautiful and slender legs again. My heart will ache."

A short and fat orc with a spiked club stopped the orc with the huge bow from continuing to shoot arrows. He carried the spiked club and walked towards Lanisi.

Lanisi's arm that was holding the sword was hit and she could not use any strength.

She raised her other hand and pulled out the dagger at her waist. Her fair face was covered in scarlet blood and her eyes revealed a determined light. She still could not see any fear.

The orcs walked over together and looked at her coldly.

The dagger in Lanisi's hand was not aimed outside, but at his heart.

She knew what the outcome would be if she fell into the hands of these orcs. As the queen of the elves, she would never let herself die in humiliation, let alone shame the elves\!

She was not afraid, only regretful.

She was regretful that she did not know that youth earlier, regretful that she had missed out on too much.

She gripped the dagger tightly, gathered her last bit of strength, and looked at the bottomless abyss beside her.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, an arrow suddenly shot over and hit the glabella of the orc with the spiked club\!

The cry of a winged dragon sounded in the night sky.

A green pterodactyl rushed over with Annie and Denise.

When the pterodactyl swooped down, the two elven girls jumped down and landed lightly beside Lanisi.

"Whoosh\!"

The orc with the huge bow happened to shoot an arrow and almost hit the green pterodactyl.

The pterodactyl immediately continued to dive into the abyss below and quickly fled the place.

Annie pulled out her sword and walked towards the hunters.

When the orc with the huge bow was about to shoot an arrow at her, Denise had already shot out first and hit his throat\!

He raised his head and fell to the ground, holding his neck and vomiting blood. He let out a desperate growl.

"Denise, retreat with His Majesty\!"

Annie said coldly, raised the sword in her hand, and rushed towards the orcs.

Back in the snow forest, she did not have any fear when facing more orcs than this. Now, seeing that this battle had been won and the elves were saved, she naturally had no fear\!

Lanisi knew that she could not help much anymore. She could only walk up the cliff with the help of Denise. She walked to the side and sat down, leaning against a rock.

"Night, are you okay?"

She asked with concern.

At this moment, the most important person was no longer her, but the youth.

Denise took an arrow and strung it. She looked at the bridge in front of her and said, "It's good. Fei'er is beside him. He saw Dolma get shot and fly over his head, then urged me to help you."

With that said, he shot another arrow and hit the throat of an orc.

At the same time, Annie swung her sword and cut off the orc's head.

"Night's eyes are so good."

For some reason, at this moment, the Queen especially wanted to see that youth's expression when facing the crushing defeat of the orc army.

Denise shot another arrow and whispered, "Your Majesty, I can tell that he doesn't like this place. He has to leave in the end."

The smile on Lanisi's face gradually disappeared. She was silent for a moment before saying, "He has always been saying that what he wants is freedom. However, who can really have freedom here? Even I have all sorts of restraints. However, if there are suddenly restraints, I might gradually forget freedom. Denise, do you understand what I'm saying?"

Denise did not speak again, and the bowstring in her hand sounded again.

Annie's sword worked perfectly with her.

The remaining ten-over orcs were quickly falling.

The remaining people started to be terrified and turned to escape.

However, at this distance, they could not outrun the arrow in Denise's hand.

Annie caught up to the mending sword and cut each head.

She had never killed so happily and easily tonight.

The flames were still burning at the entrance of the canyon, and the cries of the orcs in the canyon had yet to stop.

Even if nearly twenty thousand orcs died, it would take some time.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye was hiding behind the rocks on the hill, commanding the elves to attack one last time.

The orc army was completely defeated\!

The terrified and desperate orcs could not move forward or retreat. They could only bring the flames all over their bodies and climb the hill on both sides crazily.

The elven girls shot arrows, and the elven warriors attacked with their spears from above, holding the ground.

Fei'er's archery was accurate. She stood beside Chu Xiaoye and could hit the enemy with every arrow.

However, her arrows were quickly exhausted, and the orcs below were still charging towards the hill here.

The orc took off his clothes to prevent them from burning and roared as he rushed up the hill.

Fei'er, who had lost her arrow, panicked. She immediately pulled out the dagger at her waist and protected Chu Xiaoye. She said anxiously, "Lord Night, hide there and don't move. Fei'er will protect you."

Two black orcs rushed up with sickles in their hands and roared like thunder.

Chu Xiaoye stood up from behind the rock and pulled out his sword. He passed by Fei'er and rushed up. The sword in his hand flashed and he cut the neck of one of the orcs.

The orc's head rolled down his neck.

Another orc raised the sickle in his hand and slashed at him. Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to dodge, an arrow flew out from behind a rock not far away and pierced into the orc's throat.

Chu Xiaoye raised his sword and pierced it. With a puff, he pierced into the orc's neck and quickly pulled it out.

The orc fell to the ground and continued to roar angrily, but he could not stand up again.

Chu Xiaoye held his sword and rushed towards the other orcs.

"Lord Night\! Hide quickly\!"

The little girl named Lisa ran over with a bow and shouted anxiously.

She was the one who shot that arrow just now.

Fei'er held her dagger and rushed up to fight Chu Xiaoye.

The orcs that rushed up were all seriously burned and their combat strength had been greatly reduced. Furthermore, they were looking down on them and it was not difficult to kill them.

Chu Xiaoye swung his sword and ran back and forth on the hill. Wherever an orc rushed up, he would rush over and swing his sword to kill it.

Fei'er held her dagger and followed closely beside him.

The little girl, Lisa, stood behind and protected them with the bow in her hand.

Soon, the orcs on this hill were suppressed.

The remaining orcs started to climb other slopes and rushed towards the increasingly weaker flames at the two ends of the canyon. They wanted to risk it all and escape with their lives.

The five hundred barrels of kerosene had been used up. The sea of fire at the two ends of the canyon started to weaken under the pile of corpses.

The surviving orcs rushed over without care.

Vilis brought the dozen or so elven girls and slashed until her hands turned limp. She did not let an orc run over alive.

At the entrance of the canyon, Annie and Denise had picked up the orc's ax and were destroying the last bridge to prevent the orcs from running out and preventing reinforcements from coming.

Chu Xiaoye finally heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the orc's dying struggle was becoming weaker and weaker.

He held his sword and stood on the hill. He raised his gaze and looked at the other slopes to see if he needed to go over and help.

Lisa came to his side and said with sparkling eyes, "Lord Night, I didn't expect you to be so brave. This battle is all thanks to you. Thank you for saving us elves."

The little girl's bright eyes and sweet smile made Chu Xiaoye, who was still nervous and covered in blood, finally smile.

The little girl smiled and continued, "Lord Night, when the battle is over, I'll bring you to see Princess Nalia, okay? At that time, let Her Majesty…"

Suddenly, she pounced on Chu Xiaoye and pushed him, shouting, "Lord Night, be careful\!"

"Pfft\!"

An arrow suddenly shot over from the bottom of the canyon and pierced through her back\!

The little girl suddenly turned around, took out an arrow, and strung it. With a whoosh, she shot an arrow, hitting the orc in the chest. The orc's second arrow happened to fly over and pierced through her right eye with a puff\!

Fei'er screamed and hurriedly spread her arms, using her body to protect Chu Xiaoye.

The orc archer died completely.

The little girl's body turned limp and she fell.

Chu Xiaoye hugged her and squatted on the ground, placing her on his thigh. He looked at her with a pale face.

An arrow pierced through her back and pierced through her entire body. Another arrow pierced deeply through her entire right eye.

The bow in her hand slid to the ground. The little girl's remaining big eye trembled as she looked at him and said softly, "Lord… Lord, Lisa's eyes hurt…"

Chu Xiaoye hugged her body tightly, his lips trembling.

Blood flowed out of the little girl's mouth and her eyes also flowed with blood. However, a smile appeared on her tender face and she said softly, "Thank you, Lord Night… Without you, our elves… would definitely be gone this time…"

She raised her small hand with difficulty and grabbed Chu Xiaoye's wrist. She said with a trembling voice, "Lord Night, can… can you promise Lisa something?"

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head, and tears could not help but roll in his eyes. He could not bear to look at her pitiful appearance and said with a trembling voice, "Tell me, I'll definitely agree to you."

He had already guessed what the little girl wanted to say.

However, at this moment, he could not refuse.

The little girl held his wrist and the smile on her face was pure and happy. She said with a trembling voice, "L-Lord Night, I hope that you can stay with us elves and help… help us protect it…"

"Lord… Lord Ye, please…"

After saying this, the little girl let go of her hand and more blood flowed out of her mouth. She slowly closed the remaining big eye and never woke up again.

Another orc roared and climbed up.

Chu Xiaoye placed the little girl gently on the ground, stood up, and walked past Fei'er.
