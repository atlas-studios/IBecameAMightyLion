Chapter 238: Hero

This storm.

It lasted for an entire day and night.

When Chu Xiaoye woke up, he felt something soft pressing on him.

He turned around and saw that a snow-white tail had landed on his face.

Tilly had fallen asleep on him at some point in time and was even facing his head with her butt.

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He suddenly stood up and threw her to the ground.

Tilly woke up from her dream and lay on the ground, looking at him in confusion, as if she did not know what was happening.

Catherine was also woken up. She opened her eyes and looked at him.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and walked under the hole. He pricked up his ears and listened for a while. Seeing that the snow above seemed to have stopped, he immediately used his claws to dig open the snow on it.

Light shone down.

The wind and snow stopped outside and returned to normal.

Chu Xiaoye jumped up.

There was a thick layer of snow on the ground and the sky was blue.

However, the north wind that blew from the sea carried a faint smell of blood that lingered for a long time.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. He knew that this sudden storm not only brought cold snow, it might also bring about a cruel war.

Catherine and Tilly also jumped out of the ice cave.

Their noses were very sensitive. Before they could enjoy the beautiful scenery after the snow, their gazes turned grave.

"Roarâ€”"

Tilly roared at the icy plain not far away.

Before long, ice and snow splashed on the ground. The huge rhinoceros crawled out of the ground and walked over quickly.

Tilly led the way, looking worried.

The snow had just stopped last night and the thick snow on the ground made it inconvenient for them to walk.

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto the rhinoceros's back and invited Catherine up.

Catherine looked at him and continued to walk in the deep snow with a determined and stubborn gaze.

If she could not even walk properly, how could she fight for him?

Tilly jumped lightly on the snow like a snow-white fairy. Her fur was clean and spotless.

If she lay motionless in the snow, no one would discover her.

These snow were her natural disguise.

As for Chu Xiaoye and Catherine, they looked much more striking.

Chu Xiaoye started to hate the golden fur on his neck. In this snow-covered environment, he could be seen from afar.

He had nowhere to hide.

He had might and danger.

Here, he would rather become a baldy.

After walking for more than ten kilometers, the smell of blood in the air grew stronger.

The wind from the sea also became stronger.

They quickened their steps.

Soon, they came to the seaside and saw the sea.

On the reef near the shore, the wind and waves were surging. Many corpses were piled up densely and almost occupied the entire coastline.

Most of them were corpses of land animals.

There were wild dogs, cheetahs, rhinoceroses, elephants, and lions.

Some of them had snow-white fur and some had mixed colors. Their bodies looked huge and strong.

Blood and footprints were covered in snow on the shore.

However, the strong smell of blood still floated out.

Obviously, a big battle happened here in the snow last night.

The enemies of the sea took the opportunity to break through the seal of the island and the sea in front of them and came here, surging towards the shore. Then, they encountered the strong resistance of the animals from the land.

On the shore, a bloody and cruel battle happened.

The hero's corpse was left here.

The enemy's corpse was nowhere to be seen. It might have been torn to pieces by the remaining snow mountain team and used as food.

The troops stationed here might bring some frozen hard food to fill their stomachs, but most of them ate the corpses of the enemies in the sea.

Not far away, one island was connected to another.

The teams on the snow mountain were mostly stationed on it, guarding this territory day and night.

On the shore here, there were naturally teams guarding it. In order to prevent the same storm as last night, the enemy took the opportunity to break through the defense line.

At this moment, they had fought for the entire night and should be resting.

More than ten snow eagles flew back and forth in the sky, patrolling the coastline at all times.

They would let out a loud cry and wake up the snow mountain team that was resting somewhere at the slightest movement.

Chu Xiaoye jumped down from the rhinoceros’ back. A crisp sound appeared where he landed. Clearly, the ground here was empty and there was a cave hidden below.

Those teams should be hiding below.

He walked gently to the shore and looked at the corpses swaying in the waves. He could not help but feel respect for them.

No matter what animal they were, no matter how despicable and cruel they were on land, they were heroes here.

For the grassland, for the land, they died in battle on the battlefield, their souls returned to their homes, and their corpses were left in other villages\!

How respectable\!

Not far away, a white wolf army was walking over.

They must have discovered them.

However, when they saw Tilly's snow-white fur, they did not stop and left directly to patrol further away.

Tilly stood beside Chu Xiaoye, raised her claws, and pointed at the white lioness floating in the sea. She opened her mouth, but she did not make any sound, as if she was silently telling something.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly saw a familiar figure in the corpses.

It was a strong adult lion with a lush mane.

They had just met yesterday.

This lion king that had a conflict with the mixed fur lion king actually died here.

Yesterday, after he left, he actually brought the pride here and braved the snowstorm to help the team by the sea resist the enemy, but he never had the chance to return.

Then, he saw a few familiar hyenas' corpses.

Their queen had been killed by him and Catherine.

As for them, they did not return. Instead, they came here and died in battle in this cold sea.

Chu Xiaoye stood at the sea and looked at their corpses in a daze. The emotions in his heart rose and fell, swayed, and could not calm down.

"Roarâ€”"

Right at this moment, a high and long wolf roar suddenly came from the distant island\!

Then, wolf cries rose and fell on every island\!

In the sky, the loud cry of the snow eagle also sounded\!

In an instant, this calm sea became noisy and nervous.

The enemy was attacking\!

"Whoosh\!"

Behind Chu Xiaoye and the other two, the snow and thick ice on the ground suddenly splashed.

Snow pits suddenly appeared.

Animals hurriedly crawled out.

A cold wind blew and killing intent surged\!
