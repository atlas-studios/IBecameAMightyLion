Chapter 477: Hunger

The cold father was furious.

He continued to roar and curse at the top, jumping and shouting. He looked like a shrew that was even more furious after not being paid attention.

He was terrified, but even more disappointed.

Although he did not want to admit it previously, he had to admit that this unfilial son had brought him endless honor and made him feel pleased and proud in his jealousy and anger.

But now, his unfilial son had brought him shame at the most critical moment.

Wasn't he just furless?

Was he useless without fur?

"Coward\!"

The cold father panted heavily and continued to curse.

Every member of the pride was silent.

They seemed to be disappointed.

Mei Mei finally could not help but walk quickly under the tree root. With a whoosh, she jumped up and walked towards the tree hole.

A strange fragrance came from the cave.

Catherine stood up and blocked her path, looking at her coldly.

Mei Mei looked at her and knew her temper. She could only growl at the hole and call out to her brother.

However, it was quiet inside and there was no reaction.

After waiting for a long time, no one answered.

Even the little girl seemed to have stopped moving.

Mei Mei became worried and looked pleadingly at Catherine, as if she was saying, "I'll go in and take a look."

Catherine did not have any reaction and still stood in front of her like a piece of wood. She had no feelings, even if the two of them had grown up together, even if Mei Mei had always protected her.

The cold father was still roaring angrily from below. He was actually no longer afraid of this lioness cub that liked to open stomachs. He angrily told Catherine to scram and ordered Mei Mei to barge in.

Catherine did not look at him.

Mei Mei ignored him.

The cold father seemed to be performing a one-man show. No matter how hard he tried, they treated him as air.

Under Catherine's strong and heartless attitude, Mei Mei could only retreat in frustration.

The roars and threats of the enemies outside never stopped.

The prides seemed to deliberately make them tense up. They could not rest and were in a nervous and terrified state all the time.

At noon, the smell of fresh blood came from outside.

The enemy deliberately placed the prey they caught not far from the hole and started to eat slowly.

The cave started to quieten down.

The cold father also stopped roaring and stood in a dark corner. His stomach was heaving violently, as if the jumping and roaring just now had exhausted his strength.

All the members were silent in the darkness.

The day passed quickly.

After the sky turned dark, the pride that had stopped for a moment roared in front of the three holes again, pretending to charge in.

The guards in the cave had never relaxed.

Little Curly Tail growled and let everyone rest in shifts.

He lay side by side with Mixed Fur and blocked the first hole, changing to rest with his eyes narrowed.

The first day was still okay.

However, on the third day, everyone's stomachs started to feel hungry and thirsty.

The enemies outside still ate heartily and enjoyed their food. Some even placed the flesh of some prey in front of the hole and deliberately stimulated their hunger to lure them out.

The cold father no longer had the strength to roar.

He lay there, his stomach empty and weak.

In the past, on the grassland, when the dry season came, there was sometimes no food. They could last for more than a week, but not now.

He did not know if it was because he was used to living in luxury or because of the changes in his body. He had just starved for three days and could not take it anymore.

Everyone's stomachs started to growl.

Qiqi and Nunu crawled out of the cave and rubbed against Maya's side. They let out roars, clearly hungry.

However, Maya no longer had milk. The two of them had long stopped breastfeeding and started eating flesh.

Maya looked helplessly and pitifully at her husband.

The cold father turned his head and pretended not to see.

He could not save himself. Could it be that he wanted to eat his meat?

At the thought of this, the cold father suddenly shivered and raised his head to look at the other members of the cave.

If that happened, no one could guarantee that they would not kill each other.

Two more days passed.

The atmosphere in the cave became even more dejected and desperate.

The two young cubs were already so hungry that they did not have the strength to cry out.

Maya's green eyes in the darkness always looked at the three-headed warthog from time to time, and long saliva flowed from the corner of her mouth.

The gazes of the other members of the pride started to flicker.

The three warthogs that were helping guard the entrance felt their blood run cold and could not help but tremble.

Maya suddenly stood up and let out a hoarse and low roar.

She could not tolerate it anymore.

She drooled and slowly walked towards the three warthogs.

She had to make a choice. Should she continue to follow the rules set by the young lion king and treat these three warthogs as members of the pride and not hurt them? Or should she pounce on them, kill them, and treat them as food to save her life?

For her children, she could only choose the latter.

Furthermore, their young lion king was no longer qualified to be their king.

Although he had saved her children and this pride many times, his former glory could only represent the past and not the present.

When courage and responsibility disappeared, the lion king was no longer the lion king.

They had no obligation to follow the rules he had once set.

It was natural for lions to eat meat\!

Maya bared her fangs and turned from a hungry and docile mother to a cruel and bloodthirsty killer.

She roared and pounced over.

Everyone watched, seemingly not thinking of stopping or dissuading him. They even drooled.

Little Curly Tail wanted to stop him, but he was guarding the first hole and could not split himself.

When hunger attacked and their lives were in danger, the instincts of wild beasts woke them up. All the rules and unity could not withstand a single blow.

Pit and its two companions could only rely on themselves\!

"Bang\!"

Pit suddenly erupted. It lowered its head and ferociously rushed towards Maya, who was pouncing over. It actually sent the hungry Maya flying\!

The two larger and stronger warthogs had yet to exert their strength.

Pit immediately roared and quickly crawled into the underground cave with his two companions.

Every time it stopped at a place, it would immediately dig a cave that could accommodate itself underground and teach this habit to its two companions.

Hence, it was useful this time.

Maya got up from the ground, trembled, and rushed over again.

However, the warthog's two sharp fangs were guarding the entrance and she could not enter.

The three warthogs were safe.

Everyone seemed to be disappointed and felt inexplicably at ease.

Peace temporarily returned to the dark cave.

However, how long could this calm last?

Maya's eyes were red as she looked at the four leopards.

Blue also turned to look at her, his gaze cold and sharp.

A strange fragrance drifted out of the tree hole above him.

Chu Xiaoye, who had been sleeping for a long time, seemed to be having a beautiful dream. The tail behind him swayed unconsciously. The strands of fur on it that looked like they had just been born flickered with a charming luster and were golden.

The little girl lay beside him and hugged his neck. Every breath she let out crawled into his nose.

Catherine guarded the entrance of the cave with her back as firm as a rock.
