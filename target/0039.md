Chapter 39: Battle of the Lions

Morning.

When Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei woke up, they suddenly realized that there was another prey on the tree.

Just like the previous few prey.

Its entire body was also bloated, full of holes and was difficult to eat.

However, they were already used to it.

A few days later, this fat prey would become as dry and thin as the other prey in the storage room.

However, it was still difficult to swallow.

The two little fellows were very confused and did not know what their brother was doing.

Why did he always take advantage of their sleep to sneak into the bushes at the back and pick up some prey that they could not eat and hang them on the tree?

This might be a hobby.

The two little fellows saw that Chu Xiaoye was still sleeping and did not disturb him. They climbed down the tree together and continued to pick branches in the bushes at the back.

The first storage room had been built.

There were still two more that needed to be built.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei both thought that this spacious and soft nest was a place to sleep.

They happened to build three and the three siblings would each have one.

However, their brother's nest was full of those kinds of dry prey. They did not like it very much.

Their nests had to be clean and not have anything inside.

When they were diligently picking branches and preparing to build their own small homed, the female lions woke up one after another.

At this moment, the cries of hyenas suddenly came from the grassland not far away\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

Their cries were noisy and unrestrained, as if they were hunting in groups or deliberately provoking them.

The lion opened its eyes and suddenly stood up. Its lush mane fluttered in the morning wind, and its eyes were filled with anger and cold killing intent.

These damn enemies actually dared to come to his territory to behave atrociously\! They were even shouting near the pride's camp\!

How could he tolerate this\!

If he did not take the initiative to attack and chase them away, his dignity as a lion would fall drastically and he would lose all face\!

His recent experiences had made the female lions resent him.

At this moment, if he did not recover his lost face, how could he have the face to dominate the pride of lions in the future?

"Roar\!"

He roared in response\!

Then, he turned around and looked at the five female lions.

Since the enemy had come in full force, their pride naturally had to move out together and fight side by side\!

The five female lions all stood up\!

Including the pregnant Callie.

For the sake of their territory, dignity, food, resources, and future peace, their pride had no choice but to fight\!

Every female lion was suppressing a sense of hatred and anger\!

The hyenas had already pressed the buttons of the pride by attacking their camp and cubs three to five times\! Now, they were acting presumptuously in their territory again\!

They could not continue to be weak and silent\!

"Roar\!"

The five female lions growled angrily and decided to fight\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

"Hehehehehehe\!"

Not far away, the cries of hyenas became even more arrogant.

The lion, the cold father, growled and prepared to set off with the five female lions.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out from the tree, then quickly climbed down from the tree and followed his mother, Aisha.

The reason why these hyenas were so fearless was probably because they had come prepared from their resentment last night.

Perhaps, like the first time, they would use a diversionary tactic and lure away the male and female lions first. Then, they would attack the young cubs in the pride camp.

Chu Xiaoye decided to go over with the pride.

Not only for safety, but also for the pride\!

He was not afraid of these despicable enemies now\!

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately followed and stood beside him. Their gazes were determined and cold, and they no longer had any fear.

Lars followed.

With his current size and strength, he would have no problem dealing with the two female hyenas.

He was a lion and the big brother of the cubs.

Even his brothers and sisters dared to fight, so how could he retreat?

He had felt guilty and angry for a long time because of Gigi's tragic death last time. Now, he would make those despicable enemies pay with their blood\!

The five female lions turned their heads and looked at the four surviving cubs, their eyes filled with their mothers' worry and love.

The lion, the cold father, looked at the distant grassland. He was silent for a moment, then stopped hesitating. His gaze was cold as he led the way.

This pride was not strong and was even a little weak. Facing the morning sun, they walked towards the arrogant hyenas without hesitation.

They were fighting for their territory and dignity\!

They were fighting for their dead children or companions\!

They were fighting for their lives\!

The air was still hot.

The blood in his body was boiling and burning in the upcoming battle\!

They started running\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

When the arrogant hyenas saw the pride charging over angrily under the lead of the lion, they immediately panicked and started to flee\!

They looked fragile.

Samantha, the hyena queen, shouted as she ran, but she did not run far.

The twenty-plus hyenas split into several groups and ran in different directions.

Obviously.

They wanted to create chaos and separate the lion, the lionesses, and the cubs.

This seemed to be hunting.

The female lion, Aisha, immediately saw through her intentions. She led the four female lions and protected Chu Xiaoye and his siblings tightly. They did not split up to chase after the fleeing hyenas.

The lion, the cold father, saw through the leader of the hyenas at a glance. His mane fluttered as he roared and chased after him\!

His huge body and mighty and domineering aura immediately scared the few female hyenas around the hyena queen away\!

Samantha could not care less about giving orders. She immediately fled into the distance with her daughter.

However, she had clearly underestimated the lion's anger and endurance\!

This time, the lion did not give up after chasing for a distance like before. Instead, it ran as if it was flying, chasing relentlessly\!

Her companions and subordinates were extremely afraid of the lion. Even if they heard her call, they did not dare to approach. They only dared to run around in panic and continue to cause chaos.

Seeing the lion's huge and terrifying head getting closer and closer, Samantha was terrified\!

While running, she suddenly hit her daughter beside her\!

Her daughter was younger, had more endurance, and was faster than her.

She did not want to die.

"Ow Ow\!"

Her daughter, the future heir to her throne, was caught off guard and fell to the ground from the impact\!

The lion, the cold father, roared and chased after her, biting her neck\!

Samantha ran away with her tail wagging.

She gave birth to five children altogether. After they were born, they bit each other. In the end, only this daughter won and survived, becoming the only successor to her throne.

But now, she had no choice but to give up on her.

To her, or to most animals, nothing was more important than living.

The lion finally stopped chasing. He bit her daughter and looked at her coldly.

Samantha stopped and turned to look at him.

Then, she looked at the four young cubs in the pride.

She would never forget this\!

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

She did not stop or look at her daughter again. She immediately called for her companions and retreated.

Not far away.

In the lion's camp, the hyenas heard the roar and returned with nothing.

Chu Xiaoye's guess was right.

The hyenas' provocation this time was indeed a feint to lure the lion away.

They wanted to take revenge for the humiliation last night\!

But clearly, their plan had failed and they had lost a princess.

Of course, only her mother, Samantha, would be sad about the princess' death.

The other hyenas would only secretly rejoice.

With one less competitor, they had a greater chance.

The pride returned victorious.

The lion, the cold father, finally proved to the female lions again that he was still strong and could still protect them and their territory.

The female lions went over and rubbed against his body, trying to please him.

Even Lars ran over with a look of admiration and helped him tidy his fur as a form of intimacy.

The lion was in a good mood and did not slap him again.

Then, he looked coldly at the other three young cubs who were still standing not far away.

Chu Xiaoye did not look at him in the eye. He turned around and looked at the distant grassland, his butt facing him.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei immediately mimicked him and turned around, looking into the distance with deep eyes.

Although they did not know what to look at.
