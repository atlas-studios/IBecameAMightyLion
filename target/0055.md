Chapter 55: Infringement

In the evening.

The cold father returned after patrolling the territory.

Not long after he lay down, the roars of the Seno Brothers suddenly came from the bushes behind.

This seemed to be a roar to declare sovereignty.

The cold father and the five female lions stood up in unison and turned around to look at the bushes.

They could accurately determine the other party's location from the roar.

Obviously.

The Seno brothers had already crossed the line.

Now, they were already standing on their territory\!

The female lions let out angry roars.

The cold father hesitated for a moment, then immediately brought the five female lions to the bushes at the back.

Chu Xiaoye immediately got up from the grass and followed his mother with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

The battles between prides were mostly due to territorial disputes.

The size and location of the territory determined the amount of food and resources and the fate of the pride to reproduce.

Therefore, territorial sovereignty was not to be violated\!

Normally, two neighboring prides would never cross the borders of the other party's territory to provoke them.

A pride's battle would either result in death or injury.

They would try their best to avoid it.

Today, the newly crowned brothers, the Seno brothers, had crossed the borders of their territory and even provoked them with their roars.

Obviously, they had come with ill intent\!

The female lions were furious.

The lion, the cold father, who was walking in front, did not roar and warn anyone who invaded his territory like before.

He was deeply afraid of the Seno brothers who had cruelly killed Bill.

"Roar\!"

The roars of the Seno Brothers were just inches away\!

They had indeed entered the territory of the cold father's pride\!

When the cold father and the five female lions saw them, they were actually peeing in the bushes and marking the borders of the territory again\!

They had occupied two-thirds of the originally half-filled forest\!

The pride of the cold father was furious\!

Now that the dry season was approaching, the herbivores on the grassland had become extremely rare.

Only in this lush forest were some herbivores gathered.

Now, this shameless pair had actually forcibly occupied the forest that should have belonged to them\!

This was equivalent to snatching the food and resources they relied on to survive\!

How could he tolerate this\!

"Roar\!"

The five female lions let out angry roars and bared their fangs. They prepared to go forward and fight to protect their territory\!

The six female lions of the Seno pride crawled out of the bushes opposite and also bared their fangs. They roared at them, as if they had decided on a new territory's border\!

The Seno brothers walked over arrogantly and stood in front of their female lions, looking at the pride disdainfully.

They were not afraid at all\!

As for the cold father, he was silent with a gloomy gaze. He only glanced at the brothers and then avoided their gazes, as if he did not even dare to look at them.

He did not roar, nor was he angry, nor did he lead the female lions to charge forward and use heroic battles to protect his sovereignty\!

He quietly turned around and left.

The five female lions were dumbfounded.

The Seno brothers opposite them and the six female lions behind them looked at them mockingly. They even took a few steps forward again and continued to provoke them.

Without the lion leading the way, how could the five female lions fight?

The cold father did not stop at all. He passed through the bushes and returned to the camp to continue sleeping.

He did not want to die, nor did he want to be expelled.

Obviously, the Seno brothers were no longer satisfied with that territory. They started to drool over his territory and even his pride.

They were deliberately trying to start a battle.

If he lost, he would either die or be exiled. He could forget about possessing this territory and this pride forever.

Facing the two young and strong lions, he did not have any confidence in winning.

Therefore, he chose to tolerate it.

He looked at Lars, who was not far away, and started to feel conflicted.

This eldest son was almost two years old and was already very strong. In another two to three years, he would become a mighty and powerful lion.

If he were to stay, the father and son would definitely not be afraid of the brothers when they worked together.

However, it was also possible that the one who chased him away would be this son.

Furthermore, it was already the season where food was scarce. The territory was small to begin with, so it was impossible to rear a lion with a huge appetite.

As for this eldest son, he did not know how to restrain himself and was becoming more and more overboard. At that time, everyone would probably not be full and that would be even more dangerous.

At this moment, all sorts of thoughts were running through the cold father's mind. However, in the end, he could only hope that the pair of brothers, Seno, would stop before they went too far.

The five female lions walked back with a dejected expression. They looked at him. Although they were angry, they could only accept in silence.

They also knew that with their current strength, they could not resist the Seno pride.

Furthermore, Callie and Maya were pregnant again.

The humiliation and helplessness of losing their territory and food resources made them feel extremely terrible.

They lay in the grass, lowered their heads, and did not move.

The atmosphere in the camp was sad and quiet.

In the bushes behind.

Chu Xiaoye still stood there and quietly looked at the Seno Brothers and their pride opposite him.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei stood beside him, their eyes filled with anger.

That patch of bushes was where they had to practice hunting every night. Now, it was forcefully occupied by these baddies\!

Little Seno looked at the three little fellows disdainfully and bared his fangs, his face full of threat and ridicule.

It seemed to be saying, "Little fellows, are you very angry? Come over if you have the ability. I, Little Seno, have already prepared your fangs\!"

The six female lions behind him also had contemptuous and pleased expressions.

"Roar\!"

Catherine's voice suddenly sounded beside Mei Mei.

The female lion opposite her was stunned at first, then looked at her with a complicated gaze, but she did not have any reaction.

She was Catherine's mother.

Catherine's initial agitation gradually calmed under her mother's cold gaze.

Her gaze turned cold.

Little Seno growled, his eyes showing cold killing intent.

Catherine looked at him calmly.

Even she was a little surprised. At this moment, there was actually no fear in her heart.

She turned around and sneaked a glance at him, who was standing beside Mei Mei.

She felt very at ease.

Even if he encountered danger, he might not even care about her.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

It was all to survive. They had to struggle under cruel circumstances. Why did he have to do this?

They would guard their respective homes and bring their children along. Wouldn't it be good to get along peacefully with their neighbors?

Why did they have to fight to the death?

Chu Xiaoye did not like to cause trouble.

He only hoped to grow up peacefully.

However, reality did not allow it.

What could he do?

Therefore, he could only force himself to tell them with his actions that this handsome and cool cub was not to be trifled with\!
