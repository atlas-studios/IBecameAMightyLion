Chapter 338: Untitled

"Roar—"

The roar of the black lion king, Balo, resounded throughout the rocky hill\!

These eight strong black lions were his former right-hand men. They had been through hundreds of battles and had outstanding military achievements. Now, they had actually died under the enemy's farts and died with grievance\!

This was a deep humiliation\!

"Ugh —"

Unexpectedly, just as he opened his mouth and roared, a smelly fart that had yet to dissipate was suddenly blown into his throat.

He immediately vomited.

Chu Xiaoye rushed over at lightning speed and slashed down with his golden claw\!

Balo twisted his body and swung his tail, as if he was already prepared.

"Bam\!"

A crisp sound\!

Chu Xiaoye's claws collided with his tail.

Chu Xiaoye felt his feet go numb.

As for Balo's tail, a strand of black fur was scratched off.

Balo did not hesitate to turn around and flee\!

The current situation had already made him lose all chances. He had to take revenge, but he had to save his life first.

As long as there was life, there was hope\!

As long as he was alive, the black lions would have hope of reproducing and growing again\!

However, the path ahead was suddenly blocked.

At some point in time, Chu Xiaoye had already come in front of him from behind and was waiting for him calmly.

Balo was shocked. He did not have the time to think and immediately changed directions to escape behind.

However, at this moment, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, Catherine, and Tilly actually stood up and looked at him coldly, blocking him.

Balo's pupils constricted and he could only flee to the right.

However, at the foot of the hill on the right, two huge and mighty lions suddenly appeared.

The mixed fur and blue eyes rushed over with a group of strong lions.

On the left, the Jerry brothers, One-eyed, and the cold father also walked up with a group of strong lions.

They blocked all the paths and surrounded this powerful black lion king layer by layer.

Balo froze in place, his eyes blank.

He never would have thought that he would end up like this.

Victory was clearly in their grasp. They had clearly occupied the grassland and killed these brown lions like stray dogs, feeling extremely anxious and almost extinct. However, they suddenly lost in a battle for no reason.

He had clearly brought these young lions into a desperate situation and surrounded them. He could clearly kill all the other party, but he suddenly realized that he had become a lone lion and was surrounded by the other party.

What was wrong?

Balo turned around and looked at the young lion king again.

Chu Xiaoye did not give him any more chances to talk nonsense or live. With a puff, he rushed up.

However, this black lion king that entrusted all the black lions' hopes did not give him a chance to kill him.

Balo raised his claws and pierced through his neck with a whoosh. Then, he suddenly pulled, and his entire head almost fell.

Chu Xiaoye stopped in his tracks and froze in place, looking at him in shock.

Balo hung his head, blood flowing from his neck. His four legs were still standing steadily.

He raised his gaze with difficulty and looked at the young lion king in front of him. The corner of his mouth curled up slightly, as if he was mocking him.

He would rather kill himself than leave a mark of his defeat\!

In fact, as a lion and a lion king, he had never been defeated in a one-on-one battle and would never be defeated\!

Even the powerful young lion king in front of him could forget about defeating him\!

In the past, he lived for the dignity and honor of the lion. Then, he lived for the survival and reproduction of the entire black lion tribe. He had always lived proudly and lived brilliantly.

Until now, he had lost everything.

However, he still had his dignity. He was the king of the black lions and the once-famous Dark King that made these lions tremble in fear.

Therefore, even if he died, he had to die with dignity\!

"Bam\!"

A crisp sound\!

Little Curly Tail slapped him to the ground and his head rolled out.

Balo widened his eyes and died completely.

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a moment. He walked close, raised his claws, and kicked his head back into his body.

He originally wanted to pull out this lion king's tendon and do something, but from the looks of it, he should forget it.

Since he had committed suicide, he would leave his corpse intact.

They were all doing this for the survival of their race. Furthermore, the other party's strength and intelligence, as well as his final generosity and courage, really impressed him.

If he had not relied on human intelligence and methods to laugh last, it would definitely not have been him, but this black lion king and his black lion tribe.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of this black lion king and hesitated for a moment. He extended his golden claw and placed it on the wound on his neck.

Suddenly, heat surged out of this black lion king's body and entered his body along his golden claw.

Soon, Chu Xiaoye felt his entire body heat up and his body tremble. A thin layer of metallic luster suddenly appeared on his skin. It was not the black color of this black lion king, but his original color.

Obviously, the powerful armor of this black lion king was absorbed by him and turned into his own armor.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the dumbfounded Little Curly Tail and warned him not to touch the lion king's corpse again to give it one last dignity.

Catherine was seriously injured.

Tilly and Mei Mei were both seriously injured.

Little Curly Tail's tail was broken and his entire body was covered in wounds.

Chu Xiaoye started to use his saliva to help them heal.

Blue eyes and Mixed Fur patrolled the surroundings with the pride.

The Jerry brothers and One-eyed brought the pride to search the entire oasis to see if there were any other black lions left.

The cold father lay down at the side and enjoyed the breeze, watching leisurely as Chu Xiaoye healed them.

When Chu Xiaoye walked to Tilly's side and prepared to lick her wounds, the little white lion struggled and fiercely expressed that it did not need it.

Chu Xiaoye knew that her recovery ability was different from that of an ordinary lion. However, broken bones were not so easy to repair. Furthermore, he had to hurry back to the grassland to deal with the lions.

Therefore, without any explanation, he pushed her, the proud and stubborn little white lion, to the ground and forcefully healed her.

Tilly let out a miserable roar, as if she was complaining about his rudeness and rudeness. However, after a while, she could not help but narrow her eyes and grunt in comfort.

After helping them treat their wounds, Chu Xiaoye walked down the hill and found the black python's corpse. He used his golden claws to cut open its corpse and pulled out a long white tendon inside.

This snake tendon was soft, tough, and extremely elastic. With his strength, he could not pull it off. Previously, when he broke through the python's body inside, he was almost stopped by this snake tendon. In the end, he still used his golden claws to cut it off.

He decided to use this snake tendon to make a necklace and string the pearl in his stomach.
