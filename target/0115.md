Chapter 115: Digging a Pit

The dead were the most important.

However, it did not matter to animals.

Not only did Chu Xiaoye cruelly pull out all the tendons on Seno's corpse, but he also took away his teeth.

In fact, he even used all his strength and broke Seno's spine and ribs with his teeth.

Little Curly Tail stood at the side, dumbfounded and trembling.

Was his brother destroying Seno's corpse?

How cruel\!

Of course, Chu Xiaoye was not that perverted.

When he was removing the soft tendons, he suddenly realized that the lion's ribs were extremely tough and elastic.

Most importantly, he realized that the two rows of ribs in the middle looked like a bow if one looked at the two symmetrical bones individually.

Although they were a little small, they were definitely enough.

Of course, he also needed to break the bent part at the very bottom of the bones. This way, the opening to bind the bowstring would expand, making it more like a bow.

In order to prevent it from breaking, he could use these soft tendons and bark to wrap them tightly a few times after soaking them.

In this case, although it looked a little ugly, it would be even more sturdy and elastic. No matter how bent it was, it would be difficult to break\!

In order to fix the bow somewhere when the time came, he did not bite off Seno's spine completely. Instead, he left behind a one-meter-long spine. At that time, he would find a hard and thick branch and stack it on the spine and then bind it tightly with tree bark.

In this way, the two ends of the spine could be fixed somewhere, and this bow could be vertical without holding it.

At that time, he would only need to pull the string and aim.

However, it was not so easy to do it.

Even if it was really done, it might not be lethal.

After all, it was not an ordinary tiger\!

He had only seen the arrow and suddenly had this thought. He urgently needed to use his actions to prove that although he was a lion now, he was also a lion with human intelligence\!

He was no ordinary beast\!

In the end, it was more reliable to dig a trap.

The most important thing now was of course to dig a good trap.

As for the bow and arrow, he would take his time. He just had to prepare the materials first.

At that time, if it was made, even if he could not kill the tiger, he could use it to kill other small animals and birds. Wouldn't it be wonderful to occasionally eat a bird as an additional treat?

When he returned with Little Curly Tail, biting Seno's bones and teeth, Mei Mei was still supervising the warthog as it dug.

The little lioness was shocked to see him holding such a big bone in his mouth.

Her brother liked to chew bones?

Wasn't that something only hyenas and wild dogs would eat?

Chu Xiaoye ignored her. After putting everything away with Little Curly Tail, he walked back and slapped the warthog's butt.

The warthog was trying its best to dig a hole and was frightened by him. It immediately got up from the hole and lay on the ground.

Chu Xiaoye used his claws to pat the ground beside him.

He needed a big hole, not a small one.

This warthog seemed to be especially smart and immediately understood what he meant. It hurriedly started to expand the hole.

Chu Xiaoye let Mei Mei continue to supervise the work.

He brought Little Curly Tail to find thicker branches. When the time came, he would dig a small hole at the top of the branches and put Seno's four sharp fangs in them, leaving the sharpest part out.

Then, he would stick the branches at the bottom of the pit.

If that tiger fell, even if he could not take its life, he would definitely make it shed a layer of skin\!

As long as it was injured, it would be easy to handle.

There were many branches in the bushes, some withered and some still full of life.

Chu Xiaoye discovered a patch of bushes full of long thorns. The small thorns on them were even longer than the thorns on the vine and should be good to use.

Although he could not cause too many wounds, he could at least disgust that ferocious fellow.

Right, he was also preparing to poop at the bottom of the pit.

Perhaps God was watching over him and the tiger would faint from the smell the moment it fell in?

Even if it did not faint from the smell, at least it could be battered and flustered.

At that time, they would have a chance to take advantage of\!

His ultimate goal was to kill that fellow. As for whether the method was despicable or dirty, what did it matter?

Speaking of despicable, the ambusher was the most despicable.

Speaking of ambushers, he suddenly thought of the little leopard.

Leopards and tigers were experts in the sneak attack world and kings of the assassination world.

However, the difference in strength was too great.

He did not know where the little leopard and her mother were now. Anyway, it was best for them not to return.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head as he thought about something. He carefully used his teeth to bite off the long thorn bush from the root and brought it back.

Little Curly Tail immediately followed suit.

What was his brother doing?

He was very curious and puzzled.

With his intelligence, he actually could not guess what his brother wanted to do. He could not understand.

Could he have become stupid again recently?

He must be hungry\!

Right, it was most likely that his brother made him stupid after slapping his head all day.

His brother was jealous of his intelligence and did it on purpose\!

"Bam\!"

Just as his thoughts were flying, Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the head again, urging him to work faster.

"Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail cried out in grievance and asked his brother to stop slapping his head. This was not good.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and continued to transport the materials needed to make the trap.

After the ambush last night, that tiger should not appear again in the next few days.

After the pride ate their fill, they would not go out to hunt for many days.

This way, they would have plenty of time to make traps.

Under Mei Mei's supervision, the warthog worked especially hard.

In the evening, a pit nearly two meters wide appeared.

However, it was still very shallow and needed to be dug deeper.

At this moment, the warthog was already exhausted and could not move.

Chu Xiaoye picked up a plant root and threw it in front of it to let it eat.

Even a slave had to eat and rest before continuing to work.

Otherwise, it would be troublesome if he died of exhaustion.

While it was shivering and eating, Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail brought over a few branches full of leaves and placed them on the pit to disguise it.

It was not easy to work at night, so they would continue tomorrow.

When they returned to the pride's camp with the live warthog, the cold father and the female lions looked at them in shock.

In order to prevent the warthog from escaping or being snatched and eaten by a certain fellow, Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail bring the warthog to the Baobab tree for the night.

Then, he let Mei Mei climb up the tree to get food.

Mei Mei climbed up the tree and deliberately took out a piece of warthog from the storage room. She swayed it in front of the living warthog a few times before she threw it down.

The warthog trembled in fear and was terrified. It almost peed.

Chu Xiaoye picked up the warthog from the ground, turned around, and walked towards Catherine, who was lying in the grass not far away.

This lioness cub was injured and he wondered if she would be okay.
