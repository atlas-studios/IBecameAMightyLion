Chapter 109: Two Young Lions

After leaving the Seno brothers' pride.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and waited for Maya.

He only wanted to know how her two children were doing.

Maya also stopped in her tracks and looked at them hesitantly, still looking at them vigilantly.

Especially when he looked at Catherine with eyes full of anxiety.

In this season where food was scarce, she would not even trust the members of her pride too much, let alone a foreign lioness cub.

Furthermore, this female cub was very powerful.

She had stolen someone else's child and was naturally afraid that someone else would eat her child.

Obviously, she was unwilling to bring them there.

Chu Xiaoye was silent for a while before looking at Catherine.

Catherine lowered her head unwillingly, but she had no choice but to leave.

She decided to go back and get some food.

The bag of water was still hidden under the bushes at the rocky hill and should still be intact.

If she could smell him clearly, she would definitely be able to find him.

She left quickly.

Maya watched her leave with flickering eyes.

After a moment.

She turned around and glanced at Chu Xiaoye, then turned around and walked towards the hyena camp.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat as he followed her.

Soon, they arrived at the place where the hyenas used to camp.

Maya walked straight to a cave in the corner. She looked around cautiously for a while before looking at the cave and roaring.

There was a response in the cave.

Two childish cries came from the cave.

Then, two stupid cubs crawled out of the cave and leaned close to Maya.

Maya's gaze was loving as she stuck out her tongue and licked them gently.

Chu Xiaoye's heavy heart instantly dispersed like dark clouds and the sky turned clear again.

Looking at the two fresh and cute little lives, he could not help but walk over.

Maya turned around and bared her fangs. Her gaze was still vigilant, as if she did not want him to approach.

The two young cubs also bared their small teeth and let out cries.

Chu Xiaoye immediately stopped in his tracks.

He raised his head and looked around.

This was where the hyenas had once lived. Many carnivores smelled and walked away.

Even other hyenas were unwilling to cause trouble here.

Compared to the rocky hill, this place was indeed safer and not as hot.

However, no one knew where the hyenas went.

If they suddenly returned, Maya and the two young cubs would definitely be doomed.

Furthermore, this place was bare and not covered by bushes.

Every time Maya moved, she would be exposed to a long distance. If there were carnivores following her, it would be troublesome.

If the two young cubs were naughty and came out to play, it would be dangerous too.

Not only were there carnivores on land, the eagles and vultures flying in the sky would also capture them mercilessly.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye felt that he should let the two young cubs return to the pride as soon as possible.

"Roar\!"

He called out to Maya a few times and tried to express his intentions.

Maya looked at him but ignored him. Instead, she lay down and started breastfeeding.

The two cubs squeezed in front of her stomach excitedly and started eating.

These two cubs, one male and one female, looked very healthy.

They had just been born and their steps were slanted. How could they walk so far?

Maya would never let him hold them with his mouth.

This mother deeply understood that hungry animals were only instinctive and had no feelings.

She did not dare to let her children be bitten by others.

Chu Xiaoye sighed in his heart. He knew that he could not persuade her and could only give up.

He walked to the grass not far away and lay down, looking at the withered grassland in the distance, thinking about the future.

Not long after.

Catherine returned with a piece of warthog in her mouth.

Maya immediately looked up and stared at her nervously.

After Catherine placed the warthog in front of Chu Xiaoye, she immediately turned around and left, not looking at her and the two young cubs.

Chu Xiaoye picked up the warthog and walked three to four meters away from Maya, placing the warthog on the ground.

The two little cubs seemed to be a little afraid of him. They hesitated for a moment and swayed as they wanted to chase after him to play.

Maya looked at him and did not stop him. She immediately got up and walked in front of the piece of warthog, wolfing it down.

Chu Xiaoye stood in place and watched as the two stupid cubs swayed in front of him. His heart immediately melted. He wanted to extend his claws to touch them, but he was afraid that Maya would misunderstand. He could only stand still.

Seeing that he was not scary, the two little cubs immediately went in front of his legs happily and started to hug his legs to bite and roll. They were having a great time.

They were bored hiding in the cave.

Maya ate her food while looking up at him and her two children. She slowly relaxed her vigilance.

Chu Xiaoye stood still with his head lowered, watching the two little fellows play naughtily with a gentle gaze.

In the past, he, Little Curly Tail, and Mei Mei were also so stupid and adorable.

Suddenly, Maya raised her head and looked at the grassland not far away.

In the night, two pairs of dark and cold eyes were approaching like ghosts.

"Roarâ€”"

Maya immediately bared her fangs and shivered, letting out a terrified growl.

When the two young cubs heard her roar, they hurriedly got up from between Chu Xiaoye's legs and ran in front of her shakily. They ran into the cave in panic and hid while trembling.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and saw two wandering lions.

Although their manes were lush and they were tall, they were as thin as sticks. Their fur was messy and dirty, and they were covered in scars.

Clearly, they had been hungry for a long time and many battles had happened.

Hungry animals dared to risk their lives.

Not to mention two adult lions.

They seemed to be pacing in the night and walked over slowly. Even if they were drooling over the food in front of them, they had to maintain the demeanor of a lion.

They looked coldly at the half-grown lion at the front.

This little fellow should be easier to deal with and had quite a bit of meat. He did not need to waste too much energy chasing after it.

They were tired, hungry, and thirsty.

After biting this little lion to death, he would deal with the female lion. After all, there were still two young cubs in the cave. The female lion would not escape.

They made up their minds and immediately quickened their steps.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them coldly and subconsciously raised his right claw.

However, there were no claws.

It did not matter.

He narrowed his eyes and took a few steps forward. His body bent slightly and his muscles were tense, like an arrow that was about to go off the bow.

His claws were gone, but his teeth were not rusty\!

If you want to die, come\!
