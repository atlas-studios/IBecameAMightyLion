Chapter 53: Catherine's Secret

To Little Curly Tail.

A brain was a good thing, but it was a pity that his stupid brother did not have it.

He had thought that he had learned his lesson and knew that Mei Mei was not to be trifled with. He would not provoke her again.

Who knew that this big brother's face was covered in blood. He roared and rushed towards the Baobab tree.

He seemed to want to climb up the tree and take revenge\!

But.

Not only did he not climb up, he even fell flat on his face.

When he fell to the ground miserably and ate a mouthful of mud, Mei Mei suddenly rushed down from the tree and jumped behind him.

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

The sharp claws scratched his butt again\!

"Roar—"

Lars let out a miserable scream and suddenly jumped up.

When he turned around, his eyes were red and he bared his fangs. He was about to tear this despicable lioness cub into pieces when he realized that she had escaped to the tree again.

Lars's butt was trembling and dripping with blood. He was trembling in pain and was about to break down.

Not far away.

Callie and Maya, who were lying in the bushes, looked at him coldly and ignored him.

This young male lion, who was about to be two years old, was already starting to look down on them.

Regardless of whether it was during normal times or when they were sharing food, he always looked high and mighty.

His arrogance and pride made every member of the pride angry and disgusted.

As for him, he did not restrain himself at all. Instead, he became more and more greedy and impudent\!

Most importantly, other than sleeping, he did not do anything.

He did not contribute to the pride.

Hence, at this moment, when they saw Mei Mei reprimanding him, the two female lions did not have any reaction.

They were happy and pleased with Mei Mei's speed and combat skills.

That was because if nothing went wrong, this female cub would become the most important hunter in their pride in the future\!

Lars was still crying out miserably. His face and butt were badly mutilated and dripping with blood.

His anger and hatred were finally drowned by pain and fear.

This female cub was too fast\!

Their claws were too sharp\!

Her attitude towards this big brother of hers was merciless. Her claws were almost cruel as she scratched him mercilessly\!

Hence, he was afraid.

Although his body was stronger and stronger than hers, he could not touch her at all.

Now, he finally understood why these three fellows were always practising climbing trees.

He regretted not persevering back then\!

Otherwise, he could definitely climb up the tree and tear this despicable lioness cub into pieces to take revenge\!

Unfortunately, it was too late to regret it now\!

He did not dare to stay under the tree anymore, nor did he dare to continue roaring at the tree. He retreated and lay in the bushes.

He needed to rest and recuperate.

A dark look appeared in the depths of his eyes.

He believed that he would definitely find a chance to teach this lioness a lesson that she would never forget\!

The moment she dared to catch him, their relationship as siblings was severed\!

He was a lion\!

He had to take revenge\!

Hmph\!

Just wait and see\!

Chu Xiaoye, who was lying in the shadow of the bushes, looked at him coldly.

The pity in his heart previously disappeared at this moment.

Further away.

The lioness cub, Catherine, who was lying in the bushes, was looking at him secretly.

Over the past month, if not for this cub, she would have starved to death or been eaten by a crocodile.

When lions shared food, she never had a share.

As long as she dared to approach, the lion king would roar angrily and look at her coldly with a murderous aura.

As for the young lion named Lars, he would directly attack and teach her a lesson mercilessly with his claws.

No one helped her.

Even Callie and Maya, who had once saved her life, never left her any food.

Every time the lions ate, she could only stand not far away alone, drooling, with her stomach rumbling with hunger. She could only watch helplessly.

She thought that she was going to starve to death in this boundless grassland.

However.

Ever since that night, driven by her curiosity, she secretly followed the cub that always liked to climb up the tree to sleep. She finally saw hope and light\!

Every night, the cub would sneak down the tree and hunt in the bushes at the back.

She quietly followed.

Almost every night, the little lion would catch prey. And almost every time he caught prey, he would first bite off one of the prey's legs, eat a few bites, and then throw it away.

It looked so extravagant and wasteful.

However, it was because of his luxury and waste that she survived.

During this period of time, she had eaten a lot of abundant prey.

There were warthogs, gazelles, big rats, and even flying pheasants and birds…

Almost all the little animals in the bushes were his prey\!

His hunting skills, speed, movements, strength, agility, ambushing, and so on all made her gasp in admiration\!

Her mother and the other lionesses in the pride might not be as good as him\!

Furthermore, he could climb trees and attack on trees like a leopard\!

He was also very brave and strong. Even if he encountered two terrifying hyenas alone, he dared to pounce on them, bite one to death, and scare away another\!

Another time, he encountered a pair of leopards and daughter. He only needed to twist his body and raise his butt. He did not do anything but scared the leopard and daughter away\!

She had never seen such a powerful and perfect lion\!

Furthermore, it was a cub that was only a few months older than her\!

Even her father could not compare to him\!

He was her idol\!

She admired him\!

She was grateful to him\!

Therefore, every night when she followed him, she would start to secretly learn his hunting skills.

During the day, she also slept very little and often ran into the bushes at the back alone to practice climbing trees.

She wanted to become like him, brave and strong\!

She had to feed herself and never have to worry about filling her stomach again\!

Of course.

Before this, she would definitely make use of every night to secretly learn from him and enjoy the delicious food he threw down.

During this period of time, she felt so happy and happy. She no longer felt the loneliness and fear when she left her mother.

She liked the night.

She would look forward to the sky turning dark and the sun setting every day.

At this moment, she raised her head and peeked at him through the gap in the grass.

His amber eyes were bright and filled with light.

He was her light and her hope\!

Until noon.

The three female lions returned exhausted with half a gnu.

The heavily injured Lars immediately stood up and rushed over\!

His bloody face and fierce appearance frightened the three female lions and they hurriedly abandoned their prey.

Callie and Maya hurriedly got up and ran over.

Aisha and Xi'er anxiously called for the Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei to go over and share the food.

Chu Xiaoye stood up lazily and walked over calmly with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei.

Catherine lay under the bushes alone and ignored her.

However, she was not sad at all.

Because she still had a feast tonight.
