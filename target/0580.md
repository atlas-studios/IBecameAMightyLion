Chapter 580: Ghost of the Night

"Take aim. This lion looks like it's not to be trifled with. If we anger it, we can only shoot it."

The human loaded the anesthetic gun and the other two humans aimed their shotguns at the target.

Blue Eyes hid in the bushes, only revealing his head and his entire body trembling.

He was not a timid lion in the past.

He had been through hundreds of battles, experienced countless deaths, and seen too many powerful creatures. However, he was not as terrifying as this creature he had seen now.

These creatures were not terrifying themselves, like monkeys, but the things in their hands terrified all the powerful lions\!

Even a huge elephant could not last for more than a few seconds in front of these species.

Any ferocious and powerful animal could not resist them.

Blue Eyes had seen the scene of these species killing other animals many times, so at this moment, he was so terrified and desperate.

This once extremely fierce lion king no longer had the courage to charge out.

It was not that he was old or timid, but that the enemy was too strong.

"Get ready\!"

The human aimed with the anesthetic gun prepared to pull the trigger.

This lion lay there without moving. He should be able to shoot it. After shooting it or not, this lion would suddenly expose itself and rush out. Then, he could only kill it.

They would not lose their lives to catch a living lion.

"Whoosh\!"

Just as this human was about to pull the trigger, a strong wind suddenly came from behind. He instinctively stopped and looked back.

A few golden lights flashed in front of him like shooting stars, and then his head was cut in half.

Before he could fall from the horse, the few golden lights appeared on the neck of the human on the right again.

Hence, the human with the spear lost his head.

"What's wrong?"

Only at this moment did the last human hear the noise and hurriedly turn around.

He was terrified by what he saw\!

Before he could turn around, Chu Xiaoye's golden claw had already streaked across his eyes and cut his entire face and the gun in his hand into two\!

At this moment, the three horses they sat on neighed in fear and ran away.

Three corpses fell from the horses with blood spraying.

Chu Xiaoye landed on the ground and looked at the corpse that was spraying blood. He did not feel any guilt or discomfort.

This was his first time killing someone.

The blood in his body seemed to be burning, and the anger in his heart was still vigorous.

He was a lion, not a human.

He reminded himself.

Perhaps he could no longer protect this grassland or stop humans from killing, but his claws would never show mercy to these demons who slaughtered creatures\!

The night was dark and there was no moon.

His huge body stood in front of the three human corpses. From the moment he appeared to the end, he was silent, like a ghost.

Blue Eyes walked out of the bushes and widened his remaining eye as he looked at him. He was unfamiliar and familiar and in disbelief.

The female lions and young cubs were still hiding in the bushes, trembling.

The huge golden lion emitted a powerful aura that terrified them, making them feel despair and fear even more than those humans.

Chu Xiaoye calmed down and walked towards his old friend.

Blue Eyes was already very big and strong. He seemed to have grown a lot more, but he was already short in front of him.

Chu Xiaoye restrained the murderous aura all over his body and walked over with a friendly gaze. He stopped in front of this old friend and stared at his somewhat ferocious face, looking at it carefully.

The blue eyes started to tremble.

He recognized her\! He finally recognized her\!

It was him\! It was indeed him\!

"Roar â€”"

Blue Eyes growled, his voice trembling, as if he was greeting, but he was also very ashamed.

He left the pride of the cold father, but he was not too far away. He established a new home here.

It was not that he had betrayed them and abandoned Little Curly Tail and the others, but this land was too dangerous and there was not enough food. If they gathered, none of them could eat their fill.

Chu Xiaoye took the initiative to walk forward, lowered his head, and rubbed the black mane on his neck, indicating that it was okay.

"It's not your fault. It's good to be apart. Only then can you all survive. I don't blame you. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself."

As a former family member, Chu Xiaoye naturally understood this lion.

Blue Eyes lowered his head and took a step forward, rubbing the mane on his neck. Tears actually flickered in his remaining eye.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked in the direction Little Curly Tail and the others left in, showing them the way.

"Leave here and advance over there. The pride of the cold father will leave many smells along the way. As long as you follow them, you can find a safe territory."

Chu Xiaoye clearly expressed his intentions.

Blue looked at him and said, "King, what about you?"

Chu Xiaoye did not answer and urged them to leave quickly.

The three humans had died here and many gunshots had just sounded here. Their companions would find them soon.

If Blue Eyes' pride stayed here, they would definitely die.

"Let's go\!"

Chu Xiaoye growled and gave the order.

Blue Eyes did not dare to hesitate and lowered his head at him. Then, he brought the female lions and young cubs and left in the night.

After Chu Xiaoye saw them walk far away, he wiped his claws on the soil of the grass and turned to walk into the bushes not far away.

He wanted to wait for the humans to come and follow them.

Before long, a jeep swayed the light and drove over. Human voices came from above.

"Where are Focak and the others? The gunshots seemed to be here."

The humans in the jeep held their flashlights and started to look around. Soon, they saw the three corpses on the ground. Their expressions changed and they gasped.

"What animal did it?"

"They don't look like wild beasts\! Look at their wounds. They look like they were cut in the face and neck by a sharp blade."

"No\! It looks like claws\! Look, they're claws\!"

"How is this possible? What beast's claws can be so sharp? Furthermore, the three of them are holding guns\! Even those wild beasts that we injected dinosaurs and human genes into can't be so terrifying, right?"

The humans in the jeeps discussed as they took out their guns and looked around vigilantly. For a moment, they did not dare to get down.

"What should we do? Should we bring the corpse back?"

"Forget it, we'll come again during the day. Let's leave this damn place first\! It's dark everywhere and gloomy. I keep feeling that a pair of eyes are staring at us in the darkness, like the eyes of a demon. We have to leave quickly."

"Could those monsters have come to the grassland too?"

"Oh\! God\! Don't say such terrifying words\! Go, go, go\! When you say this, I'm even more afraid."

The jeep immediately drove away with a bang.

In the grass not far away, a huge black shadow slowly stood up and followed under the night. Like a ghost, it was silent.

The jeep did not drive quickly. As the people in the car discussed, they observed the darkness around them vigilantly.

No one would have thought that there was a pair of cold eyes staring intently at them from behind. They followed behind unhurriedly.

The owner of those eyes was even larger than the jeep they were riding in\!
