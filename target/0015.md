Chapter 15: The Baboon Army

The sun was a little dazzling.

Chu Xiaoye stared nervously at the lion on the slope.

Fortunately.

The lion only growled angrily a few times and did not do anything out of line.

Before the four female lions returned, he left coldly.

No one knew if he went to find food personally or if he was angry and did not want to see the four female lions again.

Not long after.

The four female lions returned one after another.

Looking at the young children, they did not care about their fatigue and hunger. They immediately lay down in the bushes and let the children eat.

The little cubs rushed up happily.

Aisha and Xi'er came to the tree and lay down. They softly called for Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were on the tree.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were already hungry. They originally wanted to climb down the tree immediately, but they saw that Chu Xiaoye was standing on the tree and did not move. Hence, the two little fellows hesitated for a moment and did not move again.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and led them down the tree.

As he ate his mother's sweet milk, Chu Xiaoye felt a myriad of emotions.

The cruelty of nature could only be truly experienced after becoming an animal.

How many of these young mothers and young children could last until the rainy season next year?

His mother still had plenty of milk, but her stomach had shriveled up a lot.

Chu Xiaoye looked at his claws and secretly thought about how he could help his mother share her sorrow.

After eating.

The little cubs were full of energy again and started playing around.

The female lions lay in the bushes to rest.

In the evening, after their stamina was restored, they would set out to hunt again.

The one-year-old Lars lay in the bushes dejectedly.

The lioness with a broken tail was his mother, and his mother no longer had milk.

He had already started eating meat long ago.

Even if he could go and drink the milk of another lioness, he would not be able to eat his fill.

After all, he was a young lion that was growing and urgently needed fresh meat.

Currently, he was just like the female lions. He was hungry and did not know what to fill his stomach with.

He lay in the grass for a while, glanced at his brothers and sisters who were playing, and suddenly got up and walked towards the dense bushes.

He felt that he could not wait for death.

Since his mother did not catch any prey, he would hunt personally.

The bushes nearby were full of small animals and birds. If he could catch a few, he might be able to fill his stomach.

Although he was still underage, he was still very strong compared to those small animals.

He had speed, sharp claws, and sharp teeth. Those small animals were no match for him\!

He wanted his mother and other brothers and sisters to see that without the lionesses hunting, he, Lars, could still eat his fill\!

Taking advantage of his mother's distraction, he crawled into the dense bushes and walked into the distance. His heart was full of pride.

He was a lion\! 

Wherever they passed, birds would fly away and rats would flee. All sorts of small birds and animals would panic and flee.

This increased his courage and ambition\!

As he walked, he came to a dense forest.

A strange sound suddenly came from the forest.

Lars pricked up his ears and immediately slowed down. He walked over carefully and looked through the gap in the grass. Not far ahead, there was a small animal that looked like a monkey standing on the ground.

The little animal was slightly smaller than him. At this moment, it was standing upright and crying out miserably. It looked around with a panicked and anxious look, as if it was looking for its mother.

Lars was overjoyed. He hurriedly lowered his body, sheathed his claws, and quietly sneaked through the bushes\!

The little animal clearly did not realize the danger approaching and was still crying shrilly. It seemed like it was laughing but also seemed like it was crying.

Lars seemed to see a rich meal placed on his dining table, and also imagined his brothers and sisters looking at him with eyes full of admiration and envy\!

He was extremely excited. He slowed down his steps and tried not to make any noise as he quietly approached the small animal from behind\!

"Whoosh\!"

He suddenly increased his speed, rushed up, and jumped towards the small animal\!

The little monkey-like animal finally reacted. Just as it turned around, it was pounced onto the ground by Lars, and let out a shrill and terrified scream\!

Lars bit its neck and laughed in his heart. He dragged it into the bushes\!

He decided to eat half first, then bring the other half back for his mother to eat.

However, before he could enter the bushes, he heard a loud and angry roar behind him\!

Roars came one after another from all directions\!

Immediately, it was extremely noisy and ear-piercing. Countless sounds of running and jumping could be heard, as if it was the beast tide he had seen with his mother previously\!

Lars was shocked and hurriedly turned his head to look\!

He was terrified by what he saw\!

A dense group of large monkeys ran out of the forest behind him. They bared their fangs and growled angrily. They charged out as a mighty formation and looked fierce as they pounced at him\!

There were so many of them that Lars could not make out exactly how many there were\!

The fangs that were revealed were thick, long, sharp, and terrifying\!

Lars was scared out of his wits. He did not dare to hesitate and hurriedly threw down the prey in his mouth and fled.

The terrifying animals that looked like monkeys did not intend to let him go. They roared in anger and chased after him\!

Lars was shocked, afraid, anxious, and regretful. As he ran for his life, he shouted for help with all his might\!

At this moment, the female lions were resting.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he was training his muscles with Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei on the tree.

Suddenly, he looked up and saw that the bushes not far away were rising and falling. They were shaking continuously and densely packed figures were surging over like a tidal wave\!

At the same time, terrifying roars could be heard\!

In front of those figures, a cub was running towards them with all its might\!

The little cub was his older brother, Lars, who was one year old\!

And when he looked carefully, the things chasing behind him were actually a group of huge baboons\!

Baboons lived in groups.

Every tribe was made up of at least dozens of them.

Some large tribes even had hundreds of members\!

They were omnivores that ate both plants and small animals.

Their teeth were sharp and they had a fierce personality. Due to their massive tribes, even lions did not dare to provoke them easily\!

At this moment, seeing such a large group of baboons following behind Lars with murderous intent and charging towards the pride, Chu Xiaoye was stunned\!

He hurriedly shouted an alarm towards the bottom of the tree\!

The female lions had long heard the noise. They stood up and roared as they rushed up. They stood together and protected the young cubs behind them\!

Lars' mother, the lioness with a broken tail, charged forward bravely and stopped a male baboon that was about to pounce on Lars\!

However, when she saw the dense baboon army behind her, she was shocked and hurriedly ran back with Lars.

The other lionesses did not dare to stay any longer after seeing this scene. They hurriedly brought their cubs and fled towards the grassland.

Only a male lion, their king, could deter these furious baboons\!

They only had five female lions, but they had so many young cubs to protect. They were up against 50-60 baboons. Moreover, they were extremely furious\!

They probably could not even protect themselves, so how could they protect the cubs\!

Aisha and Xi'er hurriedly roared at the three siblings on the tree, telling them to come down and escape\!

Just as Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei were about to go down, they saw that Chu Xiaoye did not move.

The siblings hesitated for a moment, then immediately stopped on the tree and stopped going down.

Aisha and Xi'er roared again in anxiety\!

Seeing that the baboon army was filled with killing intent and was about to attack, Chu Xiaoye was even more anxious. He hurriedly roared at his mother and Xi'er, who were under the tree, to let them leave quickly\!

The baboons ran extremely quickly\!

Perhaps the lionesses could escape, but the cubs definitely could not\!

Rather than being killed on the ground and implicating his mother, it was better to stay on the tree and take a risk\!

Perhaps those baboons did not know that they were on the tree\!

Although Aisha and Xi'er were anxious and worried, they had no choice but to turn around and flee with the other lionesses\!

They also hoped to use themselves as bait to lure away the baboons\!

Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei lowered their bodies and lay motionless on the dense branches.

Aisha and Xi'er looked back, relaxed, and focused on escaping.

But.

The other cubs soon slowed down.
