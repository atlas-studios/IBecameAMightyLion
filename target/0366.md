Chapter 366: Untitled

"Roar—"

Jiela walked over and bared her fangs at the hyena cubs in the cave, showing a fierce expression.

Chu Xiaoye looked at them and remembered how he, Little Curly Tail, and the other little fellows hid on the tree when the pride of the cold father was ambushed when they were young.

"Whoosh\!"

Big Jiela extended her claws and jumped into the cave like a venomous snake. She grabbed the head of a small spotted hyena and dragged it out of the cave.

The spotted hyena let out a terrified and childish cry, but it could not resist at all.

The other hyenas in the cave cowered in fear, trembling. They did not even have the courage to resist at all.

Mixed Fur and the six female lions walked in front of the other caves and prepared to kill the cubs and future competitors of this group of enemies.

Only Catherine stood silently behind Chu Xiaoye and quietly looked at the expression in his eyes, waiting for his decision.

She seemed to know what he was thinking.

Chu Xiaoye seemed to have sensed her gaze. He turned around and looked at her, but there were no obvious emotions in his gaze and face.

He turned around and walked towards the territory of Mixed Fur. He did not give any orders or stop them.

"Bam\!"

Big Jiela suddenly swung her claws and the hyena cub whose head was grabbed flew out and fell heavily to the ground. Its flesh was blurry and it died on the spot\!

Little Jiela's claws reached into the cave again.

At this moment, Mixed Fur also used his claws to take out a hyena cub from the cave and bit its neck without hesitation.

The other six female lions also started to kill.

Chu Xiaoye stopped on the grassland not far away and waited for them.

Catherine stood silently behind him and happened to be standing in his shadow. Her dark eyes were as deep as the night sky.

A crescent moon peeked out of the dark night sky and sprinkled a hazy light on the dark grassland.

The golden mane that swayed in the night wind was like a blooming flame that burned in her eyes and heart.

The cries of the hyena cubs finally stopped.

Mixed Fur and the eight female lions walked over with a strong smell of blood.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the young corpses all over the ground and did not feel any discomfort. If the hyenas had discovered the young cubs today, they would naturally not show mercy.

The competition between animals was filled with blood.

When they were about to reach their territory, Mixed Fur's breathing clearly became heavy.

He quickened his steps and ran to the front, running towards his territory.

On the sparse bushes at the border of the territory, he suddenly smelled an unfamiliar male scent. The strong scent indicated that the lion had just stayed.

An unfamiliar lion left its scent at the border of his territory. Clearly, he had already been cuckolded and his territory had been occupied.

"Roar—"

Mixed Fur was not as calm as Blue Eyes. After understanding the situation, he immediately roared angrily and rushed towards the middle of the territory.

Chu Xiaoye brought the pride and followed.

Lions usually liked to stay in bushes, and the bushes on this grassland grew extremely lush and wide because of the abundant rain.

The two raindrops not only moistened the grassland on the mountain, but also made the grassland here more prosperous.

Be it animals or plants, they were growing crazily.

The mixed fur roared and rushed towards the bushes that originally belonged to him sleeping and mating.

Before he could approach, a few roars sounded from the bushes.

Then, a group of tall figures rushed out of the bushes and prepared to fight the invaders.

Chu Xiaoye looked up and was a little surprised.

This pride, including the lion king, had a total of eight lions. Furthermore, they were all tall and strong and were in their prime. Although their bodies were not as big as mixed fur, they were not much different.

No wonder Mixed Fur's three subordinates never returned. They had probably been jointly killed by the eight brothers.

No matter which territory these eight lions went to, they were a terrifying force. Probably not many owners of territories could withstand such powerful strength.

The roaring Mixed Fur slowly stopped running. His gaze was grave, but he was not afraid.

He looked past the eight lions and at the female lions behind.

More than ten female lions followed behind the eight lions, roaring ferociously as if they were cheering.

Then, they immediately recognized Mixed Fur.

However, they were only stunned for a moment. They still bared their fangs and let out threatening and furious roars, letting the mixed fur and the pride behind him scram this territory.

This territory had already changed owners, and their king was no longer Mixed Fur. They and Mixed Fur's children either died or fled.

Now, this territory belonged to them and the eight lions\!

As for their past relationship, sorry, it had long disappeared with the wind.

The strong were their support and would never change.

"Roar—"

Seeing the coldness in their eyes and them baring their fangs ruthlessly, Mixed Fur could not tolerate it anymore. He roared angrily and pounced forward.

Chu Xiaoye knew his anger and understood what he meant. Therefore, he stood in place with the pride and did not rush up to help.

He looked coldly at the eight lions and flicked his golden claws.

Fortunately, the eight lions seemed to be confident in their strength and did not rush up together. Only one lion walked out of the crowd and faced the mixed fur.

"Roar—"

The two strong lions fought. In less than a few rounds, Mixed Fur slapped the lion's head and slapped it to the ground. Then, he bit it.

A figure suddenly rushed out from the seven lions. It was extremely fast and almost instantly pounced in front of Mixed Fur. Just as it was about to raise its claws to slap Mixed Fur's head, Chu Xiaoye's claws had already met it.

"Bang\!"

A muffled bang\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt his feet go numb and could not help but take a few steps back.

His heart trembled as he looked at the lion with a scar on its forehead in surprise.

As for the new lion king, the leader of the eight brothers, its body trembled and it could not help but take a few steps back, almost falling. Then, it looked at him in shock.

The size of the two was very different.

Chu Xiaoye was about 150 kilograms, but the other party was clearly close to 400 kilograms. His bones were thick and his muscles were bulging. They were not on the same level.

However, in the collision of strength just now, the two sides were actually evenly matched and it was difficult to determine the victor\!

This strong new lion king could not help but feel shocked. 

Why was there a terrifying strength that was comparable to his hidden in that small body?

Most animals' strength was determined by their weight. A lion's battle was usually determined by their weight.

The new lion king was in its prime and had received the grace of the two blood rains. It became stronger and stronger. Even without the help of the seven brothers, it was rare to find a match for the nearby lions.

Now, he suddenly encountered such an opponent. It was unbelievable.

"Roar—"

At this moment, Mixed Fur's sharp teeth had already bitten the lion's neck.

The new lion king turned around and a fierce glint flashed in its eyes. Just as it was about to pounce on the rescue, Chu Xiaoye pounced at him again with a whoosh.

"Bang\!"

The two claws slapped each other heavily again.

This time, the new lion king could not help but take a few steps back. Before it could stand steadily, Chu Xiaoye slapped it again.

When the other six lions heard their brothers' cries, they immediately roared angrily and rushed towards Mixed Fur.

However, a small figure suddenly flashed out from the side and blocked their path.

Catherine was pitifully small compared to them, but the female cub's dark eyes revealed an icy expression that made the six lions inexplicably terrified.

The sisters rushed up with the six female lions and stood behind Catherine.

Seeing how strong Chu Xiaoye was, the six female lions were in awe and excitement. They were confident in facing a strong enemy.

The other party's female lions hesitated for a few seconds before immediately charging over.

At this moment, Mixed Fur's sharp teeth had already bitten through the lion's neck. Its huge and heavy body was pressed against the other party's body. No matter how it struggled, it could not get up.

Seeing that their brothers were in danger, the six lions no longer hesitated. They immediately roared angrily and rushed up.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine suddenly disappeared and instantly appeared in front of the six lions like a ghost in the night. Then, she passed through them.

Before the six lions running could react, two lions fell to the ground. Blood sprayed from their abdomen and their internal organs flowed. Their stomachs were instantly cut open\!

They did not even see the figure that flashed in front of them.

At this moment, the remaining four lions woke up and hurriedly stopped running. They turned around and looked behind them.

Their brothers, the two lions with their chests broken, were lying on the ground. They had yet to die completely and were twitching in pain and despair. Their wide eyes were filled with fear and confusion.

They fell before they could fight.

Was this their end?

"Bang\!"

On the other side, the strong lion king was sent flying by Chu Xiaoye's slap again. Its mouth was full of blood and its vision was blurry. It lost all ability to resist.

Its huge body contained terrifying strength, but it could not retaliate at all.

After the first confrontation, he lost the initiative and was continuously slapped passively. He did not have the time to dodge or raise his claws to counterattack, until he lost his strength and gave up resisting.

He became weaker and weaker, and the other party became stronger and stronger. Even if their strength was equal to his, the other party's strength was endless and did not weaken at all. As for his speed, he could not compare.

The lion king was sent flying again and fell heavily to the ground.

He looked up with difficulty. His vision swayed and his mind was blank. He completely gave up struggling.

As for his brothers, they were either dead or in a daze. They could not save him.

The female lions that had originally planned to fight beside him were also terrified. They froze in place, trembling, and did not dare to move.

When Catherine cut open the stomachs of the two lions again, the remaining two lions lay on the ground, trembling and begging for mercy.

Mixed Fur bit the lion's throat until it completely stopped breathing. Then, it slowly stood up, but the anger and hatred in its heart did not decrease.

He ignored the fallen lion king and the other two lions and rushed towards the female lions, starting the bloody massacre.

He was different from Blue Eyes.

He would never allow these female lions that had betrayed him to live\!

Although those female lions might not be wrong.

Catherine looked at her king and did not kill the two lions that were lying on the ground begging for mercy. She left all of this to the lion with hatred.

The lionesses' betrayal and the death of the cubs made Mixed Fur crazy.

Chu Xiaoye ignored the lion whose mouth was full of blood and was already unable to resist. He brought Catherine and the Jiela sisters to the side and left the venue to the mixed fur.

The female lions fled in fear.

Mixed Fur bit one to death and chased after the other. After killing the third one, he raised his head and panted. He looked blankly at the female lions that were fleeing in panic and did not continue to chase after them.

Perhaps at this moment, he suddenly thought of everything that had happened between him and these female lions. Or perhaps he thought of the Blue Eyes' forgiveness of the pride.

He turned around and looked at Chu Xiaoye, not seeing any emotions in this young king's eyes.

He was silent for a moment before turning around and looking at the familiar forest. After looking at it for a moment, he turned around and walked towards his king without any hesitation.

As for the lion king that had snatched his territory and lionesses, as well as the remaining two lions, he did not look at them again.

He had already given up on this territory. As for the others, he would put them down together.

The female lions did not run far and were still wandering not far away. They were unwilling to leave this territory. Then, let them continue to stay here.

After all, this place originally belonged to them.

Killing him might make him happy, but it would also make him more bloodthirsty and cruel. It would also make this young king look down on him.

Now was not the past. Being cold to the end did not mean that he would obtain more loyalty.

His experiences along the way made him understand that the world had quietly changed. Every animal had different emotions in their hearts.

The relationship between teams was no longer like in the past where they could only be maintained with strong strength and a cold and cruel personality.

Look at this young king. Along the way, he had given him countless unforgettable lessons.

His life was also saved by this young king with another rule that did not belong to lion prides.

The world was changing, and he naturally had to change too.

And this young king was the mentor that made him change.

"Roar—"

Mixed Fur, who had its hatred melted lowered its arrogant head again and crawled in front of this young lion king, expressing its submission and following again.

He had lost everything today. Perhaps he would get more tomorrow.

He would only have a chance to get it if he was willing to let go.

He believed that following this young king would make his lion life even more exciting\!

"Buzz —"

Right at this moment, a strange buzz suddenly sounded in the night.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly looked up. At some point in time, three huge black clouds had suddenly appeared in the dark sky, almost covering the entire sky\!

The crescent moon disappeared.

The entire grassland was instantly dark\!
