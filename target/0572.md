Chapter 572: High Priest Senna

Black shadows covered the sky and their cries were ear-piercing\!

Hundreds of pterodactyls circled and screamed in the air. Then, they started to dive down one by one\!

They were not suitable to fight in the tall forest with dense bushes and trees, so they did not rush down directly. Instead, they stopped on the high canopy and continued to use their cries to threaten the cowards hiding below.

The pterodactyl with arrows in its eyes let out an especially sharp and angry cry, urging its companions to go down and take revenge.

However, its companions were not stupid.

The bushes below were dense. Once they landed, they could not fly. Their speed and sharp claws would lose their might.

They could only stay on it and use their cries to attract the other wild beasts in the forest and the dinosaurs that had not gone far to chase the cowards out from the bushes.

Chu Xiaoye brought Lanisi and the others and patiently hid in the bushes below, not showing his head.

As long as the huge chimpanzee and dinosaurs did not come, the few of them could deal with them.

Chu Xiaoye had already turned back into human form and was holding a sword in his hands, preparing to kill any pterodactyl that dared to land at any time.

The sun soon set and night fell.

The pterodactyls that stopped on the canopy and the pterodactyls circling in the sky finally could not stay any longer and started to leave one after another.

The pterodactyl that Denise had shot in the eye had already died on the canopy.

Chu Xiaoye stared up until all the pterodactyls flew away. Then, he crawled out of the bushes and looked at the sea.

The departing merchant ship indeed returned and had already stopped at its original location.

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to hesitate and immediately brought Lanisi and the others out of the forest and ran towards the sea.

Sharp cries suddenly sounded in the sky.

A pterodactyl discovered them and was about to dive down when it realized that it was weak alone. Its companions did not rush over and only circled in the sky, screaming.

Chu Xiaoye and the others quickly rushed into the sea and ran towards the merchant ship.

Finally, before the pterodactyl called its companions over, they climbed onto the ship.

Seeing that only they had returned, the expressions of the Qin family members were extremely ugly. However, the sacrifices of the twenty Qin family members were worth it. At least they were alive.

Qin Zhitan immediately ordered the ship to set off.

When the pterodactyls gathered again, the big ship left the island.

Although the pterodactyls could fly, they did not dare to go too far from the island and could only give up.

Three days later.

More and more boats appeared on the sea.

In the evening, they finally arrived at the southern harbor of Rakshasa Kingdom.

This was a commercial harbor. There were people coming and going on the harbor, and it was very lively.

People were wearing colorful clothes and golden ornaments. Even the movers were mostly dressed like this.

Because they often worked at the harbor, their skin was tanned and filled with luster in the sun. There were also some people who came to the harbor to play. Their skin was mostly white and smooth, with a high nose and blue eyes. Their hair was golden, orange, black, and silver and other colors.

The Rakshasa Kingdom had more people and was made up of mixed tribes.

The big ship stopped at the harbor and soon arrived in front of the tax collectors.

This ship often came between Southern Tang Country and Rakshasa Kingdom. It had all sorts of credentials, so no one checked it.

After getting off the ship, the Qin family stationed here brought their servants over to welcome them.

The news of Suhang had already been sent through the messenger pigeon.

The Qin family here were terrified and uneasy. They looked forward to the ship coming every day.

When Qin Zhitan brought more than 100 Qin family members to the harbor, the Qin family members who had come to welcome him immediately cried tears of joy and ran up to hug him.

However, this was not a place to talk.

Qin Zhitan brought Chu Xiaoye and the others and followed behind the Qin family manager. They entered the city and lived in a spacious yard.

More than 100 members of the Qin family were waiting for Qin Zhitan's arrangements.

Fortunately, the business here was quite big. Everyone found a place to stay and a good job.

After dinner, Chu Xiaoye bid farewell to Qin Zhitan and the others.

After such a long delay, they had to find the high priest and bring her back as soon as possible.

Qin Zhitan urged them to stay again and again. Qin Mo and Qin Xiaoye's eyes turned red and they were unwilling to leave.

However, Chu Xiaoye and the others did not belong here.

They rode their horses and left through the night.

It was said that the high priest named Senna lived in the capital of the Rakshasa Kingdom, Mori. It was still two days away from here. They had to send it out overnight and not delay for a moment.

They rode their horses and walked along the official road without obstruction.

Two days later, they arrived at Mori, the capital of the Rakshasa Kingdom.

Mori was an ancient and majestic city. There were castles everywhere and the nobles of every nation lived inside, making it extremely prosperous.

During the day, they entered the city.

Lanisi only knew that Mori was here, but she did not know his exact residence. She could only search slowly.

Because the elves had long merged with the Rakshasa Kingdom, there were also many elves in this city.

Chu Xiaoye did not cover them, but he let Lanisi and the others wear headscarves and veils. After all, these elven girls were too beautiful and striking. It would be troublesome if they attracted those nobles with ill intentions.

Senna was once a high priest, strong and outstanding. Therefore, even if she came here, she would never be unknown.

Chu Xiaoye had asked in the restaurant, the peddlers, the passersby, and even the court and finally obtained news about the high priest.

It turned out that the high priest lived in the northern cloister of the city and had already become the respectable Grand Imperial Preceptor of the Rakshasa Kingdom.

Chu Xiaoye immediately rushed over with Lanisi and the others.

However, they were stopped outside the door. No matter how they explained, they could not enter.

Lanisi could only take out the dagger that had once saved her life from her waist and hand it to the septa at the door, letting her go in and hand it to Senna. "Just say that an old friend is here to visit."

This dagger was once given to her by Senna, and she had saved Senna's life in the Elf Kingdom.

Before long, the door opened.

The septa brought them in.

Chu Xiaoye, Fei'er, and the others were sent to the living room at the side to wait, and Lanisi was left alone.

In the end, Lanisi did not return from noon until the sky turned dark.

The septa brought dinner over. Fei'er could not help but ask her, but she shook her head and did not know.

Chu Xiaoye was afraid that something would happen to Lanisi. Just as he was about to bring Fei'er and the others to find her, Lanisi finally returned.

Along with her was a tall woman with blue hair.

Lanisi's eyes were red as she whispered, "Senna is seriously ill and can't follow usâ€¦ However, her disciple, this Miss Rosa, can return with us."

Rosa bent at the waist and said, "I will follow my master's orders and help you open the altar and repair the barrier."

Catherine, who was behind Chu Xiaoye, suddenly let out a low growl. Then, her figure flashed and she pounced at the woman with a whoosh\!
