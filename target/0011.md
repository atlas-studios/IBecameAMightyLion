practisedChapter 11: The Three Siblings

After eating.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree and prepared to exercise.

When he saw the bloodstains on the branch, he recalled the terrifying scene last night with lingering fear.

If he had not pretended to be dead and deceived that python, his corpse would have already rotted in the python's stomach by now.

Although the python was not too big, it was definitely terrifying for the young Chu Xiaoye.

If it was a young cub who was in that situation instead, its bones would definitely be broken and it would suffocate to death\!

However, he did not.

Although it was painful when the python coiled around his body, his bones and muscles seemed to be able to withstand the terrifying strangulation force.

After that, when the strange heat in his lower abdomen rose, the pain was greatly reduced. Furthermore, he did not need to breathe and his consciousness became very clear\!

His young body seemed to have been modified.

Not only did his bones and muscles become much stronger, but he was also able to withstand the python's strangulation and hold his breath for a long time.

Of course, there was also the magical function of his saliva.

It seemed that there was a reason why he had been farting and passing out black faeces these few days.

He was probably excreting the impurities that had been cleared out of his body after his body had been modified.

What was that warm current in his stomach?

He could not understand.

He did not want to waste time thinking about it.

Anyway, that heat was extremely beneficial to his current survival.

He decided to try holding his breath again.

He had held his breath for about seven to eight minutes last night.

It was those seven to eight minutes that saved his life.

It would be even better if he could hold his breath for a longer period of time in the future.

He took a deep breath and started holding his breath.

One minute.

Two minutes.

Three minutes.

Five minutes later.

He could not hold it in anymore.

Although he did not hold his breath for as long as he did last night, five minutes was enough to beat all the other lions\!

His body had indeed been modified\!

He decided to add the ability to hold his breath to the list of abilities he needed to train.

If he practiced twice a day, he would definitely be able to extend how long he could hold his breath for. He would definitely be able to dig out the potential he had last night\!

He climbed down from the tree and began to practice climbing trees.

From the first branch to the second branch, he slowly moved upwards until he reached the softest canopy\!

When climbing a tree, he could also train his muscles, agility, and speed. He could also train his heart and lungs.

Not long after, he started panting.

However, compared to yesterday and the day before yesterday, he felt that his strength and endurance had increased a lot.

He continued practising.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei slept for a while. When they woke up, they joined in on the fun.

Mei Mei's talent in climbing trees was not just for show.

When Chu Xiaoye climbed up to the canopy for the third time, the female cub also climbed up while panting.

Although she looked a little scared, she was more excited.

Standing on the tree, she could see everything in the grassland.

Little Curly Tail was a little clumsy.

However, this brat never admitted defeat.

No matter how many times he failed, he continued practising.

Furthermore, he was extremely bold\!

There was once when he nearly fell off the third branch. He only had one claw on the branch, and his life was hanging by a thread\!

In the end, when Chu Xiaoye saved him, not only did he not retreat, he even continued to climb even higher.

Finally, in the evening, he successfully climbed up to the canopy\!

Chu Xiaoye admired his courage and perseverance.

The three little cubs stood at the highest point of the big tree, welcoming the fiery red sunset. They looked at the beautiful scenery on the grassland with high spirits.

It was as if they could see the future. Two majestic lions and a beautiful female lion were running on the vast and beautiful grassland. All the animals and enemies were terrified by the scene and avoided them\!

"Roarâ€”"

Little Curly Tail was excited. He could not help but raise his head and shout. However, his childish voice immediately ruined the atmosphere.

Aisha paced restlessly under the tree. She raised her head and let out anxious and worried cries, calling for the three naughty children to come down quickly.

They were too high up\!

She was afraid.

Xi'er came back with wounds on her face.

She timidly glanced at the lion on the hill not far away, then looked up at her daughter on the tree.

When Mei Mei saw her mother return, she immediately climbed down the tree carefully.

In the evening.

It was time to go out and hunt.

The male lion stood up from the hill and let out an impatient roar. He looked at the female lions with a dignified gaze.

Xi'er stayed to take care of the cubs.

The other four female lions set out to hunt.

Their shriveled stomachs and silent and neat steps seemed to be filled with a sense of tragedy under the setting sun.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the tree and watched the scene quietly. A sense of respect and pity welled up in his heart.

Be it animals or humans, mothers always had it the most difficult and carried the most responsibility.

Under the tree.

A group of little cubs were still feeling carefree and playing around excitedly.

Perhaps they only thought that their mothers would be able to bring back delicious food so long as they left.

However, they did not know just how much risk their mothers took.

Some mothers might never come back after leaving.

Some turned into white bones.

Some did not even have bones left.

This kind of cruel and cold tragedy was happening all the time on this beautiful grassland.

Xi'er patrolled the surrounding bushes vigilantly, afraid that those despicable hyenas would take the opportunity to attack again.

The lion lay lazily on the hill, not wanting to move.

He only wanted to wait for the food, eat, and then continue sleeping.

The little cubs were playing under the tree.

Chu Xiaoye continued to do all sorts of strange actions on the tree. He was so diligent that even he himself was surprised.

Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail watched in a daze for a while, then curiously followed suit.

The sun soon set.

The lion stood up from the hill and paced impatiently, looking coldly at the distant grassland.

Xi'er stood not far away and looked at him timidly, not daring to approach.

Night fell.

Darkness shrouded the vast grassland.

But their eyes could still see very far.

In the distance, the four female lions had yet to return.

The young cubs, who had been playing all afternoon, were now hungry. They quietened down and waited anxiously for their mothers.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the canopy and looked at the dark grassland. He suddenly had an ominous feeling.

Mei Mei climbed down the tree and went to her mother to drink milk.

Little Curly Tail had been exercising for the entire afternoon, and his stomach was already rumbling with hunger. He also shamelessly followed her.

Xi'er lay down and looked lovingly at the two young cubs. She then raised her head and looked at Chu Xiaoye on the tree. She softly called for him to come down and eat.

Chu Xiaoye looked into the distance and did not respond.

He was worried about his mother and the other three mothers.
