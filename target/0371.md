Chapter 371: Untitled

Chu Xiaoye did not dare to touch Tilly again.

If he continued to touch her, she would really be bald.

Forget it if her head was bald. At that time, her butt would also be bald. Then, this female cub would definitely kill herself in despair.

Losing fur was a metabolism every animal had, but it was the first time Chu Xiaoye had seen such a serious drop of fur. It was clearly abnormal.

Was it illness, was it because she loved to lose her temper, or was it caused by a biological disorder?

Chu Xiaoye was not a doctor and could not find out the reason immediately. Naturally, he could not treat the illness. He could only do his best to help this female cub.

Although the animal world was cruel and cold-blooded, there was true love between lions.

Chu Xiaoye placed the cow leg on a branch and licked it with his tongue. He even soaked it in saliva for a while and spat a lot before placing it in front of her.

"Eat. You'll get better after eating my saliva."

Tilly raised her eyes with difficulty and looked at him. Her mouth moved, as if she was saying, "Scram\!"

Seeing that she did not appreciate his kindness, Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with her anymore. He turned around and went down the tree to eat fresh steak.

The little girl was standing in front of the huge water buffalo with a knife and carefully cutting the beef slices. Seeing him come over, she smiled shyly and continued to lower her head to cut seriously.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her and saw that she was becoming more and more proficient in her knife skills. Her thin dress was stuck to her body and her face was healthy red under the sun. She did not feel cold from the rain and cold yesterday. He was secretly surprised by this little girl's adaptability.

Of course, his saliva and the blood rain should have contributed greatly.

Chu Xiaoye lowered his head and ate the beef, deliberately leaving a big piece of good steak for her.

The little girl picked two very big banana leaves and placed them in front of her. She spread the cut beef slices evenly inside.

The beef slices were cut very thin by her and were transparent under the sun. They looked fresh, juicy, and extremely delicious.

However, this was not suitable for her taste. Only when the blood and water in it were dried and the stench was reduced to the lowest would she not find it difficult to swallow.

After Chu Xiaoye finished eating, he called for Little Curly Tail and walked into the depths of the bushes.

In this vast forest, Chu Xiaoye discovered many interesting things, such as wild pepper, wild chili, some sweet nectar that was like honey, and all sorts of plant spices like Jasminorange.

If he used these things to make beef jerky, it would definitely be much more delicious than dried beef jerky.

Under the lead of Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur, the nearest pride of the cold father was slowly familiarizing themselves with this territory that belonged to them. Other than the Chino brothers peeing to mark the territory, the cold father was also unwilling to be lonely and met his friends by peeing.

They marked the border and admired it all the way. They looked at the fertile and beautiful grassland and the groups of herbivores. They felt as beautiful as this grassland and the sky.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to disturb them for the time being. Even if they encountered enemies, he would let them deal with them themselves.

Since they treated this place as their new home, they had to adapt to this place and use their abilities to protect this territory.

When they passed by the orchard, the little monkey's corpse had already disappeared.

The Belita sisters were jumping around on the tree, picking fresh and ripe fruits. They looked free and very happy.

When they saw Chu Xiaoye, they immediately threw down fruits, but Chu Xiaoye agilely dodged them.

Belita roared from the tree and said, "The big smelly fart is here\!"

Belia jumped down and twisted her butt, moving in front of Chu Xiaoye. As she rubbed the golden mane on his neck, she lowered her body and wanted to crawl under him. Her eyes were watery and her face was filled with charm.

This young lion king was becoming more and more mighty and strong\!

Chu Xiaoye slapped her and slapped her to the ground. He did not have any protective feelings for the fairer sex and left.

Little Curly Tail followed behind and wagged his tail happily. His brother only brought him today. He did not bring Catherine, the tail beetle, or the annoying Mei Mei. It could be seen that his love for his brother had finally returned.

However, soon, he wanted to cry.

His brother actually picked many messy things and wrapped them in cowhide for him to curl with his tail. He completely treated his handsome and domineering tail as free labor and did not pity him.

He thought that he had a secret mission to complete.

Until noon, the two brothers returned to the camp.

The little girl was sitting on the grass, spreading out the two big banana leaves and drying the beef slices.

As for her, she also narrowed her eyes under the sun and enjoyed this rare warmth. Her fair little face revealed a very satisfied expression.

Catherine, Mei Mei, and Molly were still busy transporting and making the huts on the tree.

Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail casually put those things in the grass and walked towards the little girl.

When he came in front of the little girl, the little girl woke up with a start and looked at him with her eyes wide open. She wanted to ask him where he went, but she felt that she did not have the right to ask.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the beef slices on the ground and thought to himself that if he could get some salt made from seawater, the taste should be much better.

He extended his claws, used the tip of his claws to take a piece, and placed it in his mouth. He chewed it a few times and felt that it no longer had any taste after being exposed to the sun it no longer had any taste.

Indeed, lions liked meat with strong blood and smell.

The little girl stood up and pointed at the dried beef on the ground, letting him help watch. Then, she turned around and left to help Mei Mei and the others pick the branches.

She had wanted to help just now, but she was afraid that the beef jerky she was drying would be stolen, so she had been guarding here.

These beef jerky were her future food, so she took them seriously.

Animals could kill each other and risk their lives for food. Now, although she would not be like this, she was actually no different from an animal.

She could hand these beef jerky to Chu Xiaoye to look after without hesitation, so she naturally trusted him very much.

However, when she returned dripping with sweat, the beef jerky on the ground was already gone.

Chu Xiaoye lay at the side, narrowed his eyes, and enjoyed the sun, looking full and lazy.

The little girl looked blankly at the two empty banana leaves on the ground and was a little sad. She was not full yet and was preparing to eat after drying. Furthermore, those beef slices were enough for her to not starve for a week.

However, she naturally would not be angry.

Her life belonged to this young lion king. What was a little beef jerky? Furthermore, these beef jerky did not belong to her in the first place.

The little girl turned around and looked at the huge cow skeleton not far away. Then, she picked up a banana leaf from the ground and walked over quickly, taking out the sharp knife from her waist.

There were still many small pieces of meat on the cow skeleton. Although there were many flies and small bugs fighting for food, the current her did not care about these. As long as she could fill her stomach, she did not care if it was dirty.

The little girl used a small knife to scratch seriously, placing all the pieces of meat she scraped on the banana leaf.

From noon to night, he was exhausted.

However, the empty banana leaf was finally filled with red beef again.

The little girl sat on the ground to rest, using her small hands to wipe the sweat on her forehead. She looked down at her results and revealed a happy smile.

However, before the smile on her face could bloom completely, Chu Xiaoye suddenly appeared beside her. He curled his tongue and rolled the pile of beef fragments on the banana leaf into his mouth. He did not need to chew and swallowed them in one bite.

The bright smile on the little girl's face froze. She looked up at him in shock.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at her and turned to leave.

The little girl sat on the ground in a daze and looked at him in a daze. After a while, she stood up and continued to search for the remaining meat and beef fragments on the bull skeleton with the knife.

However, the sun had already set.

Although the moon had risen, she could not see anything.

If she waited until tomorrow, these meat would have long been eaten by those little insects.

The little girl could only put away the knife and sigh softly. She decided to continue cutting when the pride caught prey next time.

The pride would usually hunt once every two to three days. She should be able to last until then. If she was really too hungry, she could go to the orchard at the back to eat some fruits.

"Roar—"

"Roar—"

The roars of the cold father and the Chino brothers suddenly sounded from the distant grassland.

This roar was not emitted because an enemy had invaded. Instead, every lion used it at night to warn the enemy outside the territory, letting them know that this territory had an owner and not to approach.

Sometimes, the entire pride, including the female lions, would roar with them to deter the wandering and coveting enemies nearby.

However, few lions on this side of the mountain would use this method to deter the enemy.

Most of them used actions to make the other party leave.

The silent Blue Eyes, Mixed Fur, and the Jerry brothers would scare the enemies with ill intentions if they stood casually at the borders of the territory.

If a wandering lion was unwilling to accept it and lingered around, these few big fellows did not mind crossing the territory and going over to use their powerful strength to make the other party scram.

Ever since he came here, the cold father's horizons had been broadened and he was much more terrified.

The lions here, and even the female lions, were larger and stronger than him. How could he not be terrified?

However, Chu Xiaoye knew that if they really fought, the cold father might not be weaker than those tall and mighty lions because the cold father's bones and physique had evolved too crazily.

Chu Xiaoye ignored these roars that broke the silence of the night and continued to busy himself making huts on the tree.

Catherine left quietly.

Because the little girl seemed to be a little sleepy. She raised her head under the tree and waited for him for a while. Seeing that he ignored her, she left alone and went to the bushes to sleep.

The grassland at night, even this forest, was not safe.

Catherine followed behind the little girl silently until she crawled into the bushes. Then, she pricked up her ears and listened to the surroundings before returning to the camp.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at her and sighed inwardly. He had been soft-hearted back then and saved this female cub. He never would have thought that this female cub would become his right-hand man and silently help him so much. Furthermore, she was gentle and considerate. She could understand his intentions at a glance.

He seemed to be used to this female cub following behind and doing things for him silently.

Little Curly Tail went to bully Molly again.

From the initial intense resistance, to the final honest acceptance, Molly finally became calm.

She thought in her heart that this bad boy would not really hurt her anyway. If he was tired of bullying her, he would naturally not look for her again.

However, she had underestimated Little Curly Tail's interest in bullying other lions.

When he was young, due to Chu Xiaoye's suppression, Little Curly Tail really wanted to bully Mei Mei, but he could not do so and could only hold it in. Now that he had a target he could always bully, and his brother seemed to have started to ignore him, he naturally would not let go easily. The more he bullied, the more excited he became and the more impudent he became.

In the end, it became a habit.

If he did not bully Molly one day and ravage this female cub, Little Curly Tail would really feel uneasy.

Mei Mei stayed with her mother and lay in the grass to rest.

The other female lions also closed their eyes.

Molly's weak roar sounded by the river outside the bushes and finally returned to calm.

Chu Xiaoye stayed on the tree for a while, then climbed up to the high ground. He turned over the thick antelope fur and the beef jerky smeared with honey and spices and waited for the sun tomorrow.

The night wind carried the aura of the sea and waves of cold air.

Chu Xiaoye jumped onto another Baobab tree and looked at Tilly's situation. He felt at ease when he saw that the female cub's breathing was even and she was sleeping soundly.

He jumped down from the tree and walked to Mei Mei's side.

Mei Mei was very vigilant and immediately opened her eyes. When she saw that it was him, she was a little puzzled and hurriedly stood up.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and pointed at the Baobab tree, telling her to sleep on the tree and guard the beef jerky on the top of the tree to prevent thieves from stealing it away.

There were many thieves in the bushes and many thieves in the sky. They did not care if this was the territory and camp of the pride.

Mei Mei immediately understood. She walked under the tree and agilely jumped up. She climbed up high and lay beside the beef jerky.

His brother was really good to that strange little thing. Unfortunately, the other party did not seem to be of any use.

Mei Mei thought to herself that perhaps her brother had stored food on the other side of the mountain before the dry season and prepared to raise this little thing. He would only use it when there was a lack of food.

The little thing's skin was white and tender, and it had no fur. There was also a fragrance on its body. It must be delicious.

Mei Mei drooled and closed her eyes.

Chu Xiaoye left the camp and walked towards the bushes in the forest at the back.

The little girl was curled up in a ball and sleeping inside.

When Chu Xiaoye crawled in and lay beside her, she could not help but crawl into Chu Xiaoye's arms. Her cold face was buried in Chu Xiaoye's warm mane as she muttered, as if she was sleep-talking.

Outside the bushes, the moonlight was like water, shining on the grass in the forest and flowing quietly.

Catherine lay in the grass not far away and looked up at the starry sky. The bright stars seemed to be blinking at her playfully, then reflected in her dark eyes, flickering lively in her pupils and heart.

The night was not dark and the loneliness was not cold.
