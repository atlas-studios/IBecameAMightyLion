Chapter 330: Becoming a Spirit\!

After dark.

All was quiet.

Although the murderous aura of the pride was invisible, many small animals would instinctively sense it. They would either flee far away or hide in the cave motionless.

The night gave the black lions a black disguise, but it did not hide the dark light in their eyes.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the tree, his eyes flickering with a golden light. He could clearly see those dark and cold eyes ambushing everywhere in the forest in front of him.

Nearly fifty black lions were gathered in the small forest.

However, he did not see the black lion king.

Chu Xiaoye silently remembered their location and did not let down his guard. He still observed secretly from the tree.

Suddenly, a black lion got up from the ground and lowered its body, as if it was ambushing prey. It quietly walked over. Its feet were silent, but its killing intent was revealed.

Then, the other black lions beside it immediately got up and quietly followed behind it.

There were ten in total.

Other than the leading black lion being a lion, the other nine were female lions.

Chu Xiaoye narrowed his eyes and lowered his head to look at Catherine.

Catherine was lying on a branch and peeping at him with her head tilted. When she saw him looking over, she was first stunned, but then she immediately stood up. A cold glint flashed in her eyes as she looked at the forest in front of her.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and patted the tree trunk gently.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei, who were sleeping, immediately opened their eyes and looked forward.

Tilly was still sleeping on another short tree.

When the ten black lions sneaked close, they looked around in bewilderment and searched, but they did not find any trace of them.

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, Little Curly Tail, Catherine, and Mei Mei all jumped down from the tree and pounced at the pride\!

Immediately, a scream sounded and blood splashed\!

The leading black lion was about to turn around and escape when Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped down from the tree. The golden claws that he flicked out flickered with a cold light under the moonlight\!

"Whoosh—"

The black lion reacted extremely quickly and suddenly rolled to the side. Then, it jumped up and fled towards the distant forest with lightning speed.

Chu Xiaoye had just landed when a stream of air suddenly spewed out from behind him. He jumped up and instantly landed in front of him. He swung his golden claw and slashed at his head\!

The black lion was shocked. It hurriedly stopped in its tracks and raised its claws to face the attack\!

"Chi\!"

Blood splashed out\!

The entire claw of the black lion was cut off and landed on the grass.

"Roar—"

The black lion's scream was extremely miserable and resounded through the forest\!

Just as he was terrified and prepared to escape to the side, Chu Xiaoye had already pounced forward at lightning speed and pierced his neck with his claw\!

Then, a huge lion with a lush mane fell to the ground.

Blood sprayed and the headless corpse stood for a few breaths before falling to the ground softly.

Although this black lion did not last long under Chu Xiaoye's attack, it was still quite strong and was much stronger than the other black lions previously.

It seemed that the black lion gathered beside the black lion king still had many experts.

At this moment, the other nine female lions had also fallen into a pool of blood. None of them escaped.

The fighting and roars here naturally reached the forest in front.

However, the black lions only listened quietly and did not come over again.

This small army was clearly just testing to see if they were prepared.

If they were not prepared, they would definitely take advantage of the night to attack in full strength. If they were prepared, they could only wait.

Obviously, the black lion king was still taking the time to heal.

Those black lions were waiting and protecting their king.

Although he had won the battle, Chu Xiaoye was not careless at all. He immediately retracted his troops and continued to climb up the tree with Little Curly Tail and the others to wait.

The forest quietened down again.

The battle just now seemed to be an insignificant episode and affected something.

Chu Xiaoye squatted on the branches and was not sleepy at all. He continued to observe the movements of the black lions hiding in the darkness in front of him.

Suddenly, a snow-white tail reached down from the dense leaves above him and fiddled with his head a few times, as if it was stroking.

Chu Xiaoye looked up. At some point in time, the little white lion had already secretly climbed to the top of the tree from the short tree.

He opened his mouth and prepared to bite and teach her a lesson.

Tilly seemed to know his intentions long ago. After fiddling with it a few times, she immediately retracted it and stuck her head out of the leaves. Her light blue eyes stared at him, as if she had just woken up and suddenly remembered something.

"What about that thing?"

Chu Xiaoye knew that she was still thinking about the pearl. He opened his mouth to show that he had lost it.

"As for where it was thrown, who knows?"

He had yet to decide who to give that pearl to, but he would definitely not give it to this little white lion.

Perhaps he could give it to Little Curly Tail and let Little Curly Tail give it to Molly, thereby accomplishing a beautiful thing.

Perhaps he could give it to Mei Mei to make the girl happy and love him more.

Or he could give it to Catherine.

Catherine had worked hard and had once traveled thousands of kilometers to find him alone. She was loyal to him and deserved a reward.

Of course, this little white lion had also done many things for him and given a lot. However, he just did not want to care about her, let alone give her something. God knew why.

"I hate you\!"

Seeing that he had really lost the bead, Tilly immediately had a resentful expression and tears filled her eyes. She immediately retracted her head and ignored him.

Just as Chu Xiaoye could not bear to do so, he heard snoring coming from above.

This spoiled and strange lioness cub was really unpredictable.

Why did she follow him here from so far away if she did not want to stay on the snow mountain? Could it be that she wanted to seek excitement and travel around?

He did not want to lose his life accidentally.

They were running around for survival, and this Missy was running around for joy. This was so similar to the world of humans.

There was poverty and wealth everywhere.

It was unfair everywhere.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was looking at the forest in front of him and thinking about something, a few drops of liquid suddenly fell from above and landed on his head.

He looked up and saw a snow-white tail quietly shrink back.

Bastard\! She actually peed on his head\!

Chu Xiaoye was furious. He suddenly extended his claws and prepared to teach the female cub a lesson\!

"Whoosh\!"

The leaves swayed and his claws missed\!

Tilly jumped onto a branch at the side and lowered her head to look at him. She narrowed her eyes and grinned, looking like she was gloating. She even stuck out her little tongue playfully.

This female cub had become a spirit\!
