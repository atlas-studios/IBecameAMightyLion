Chapter 14: Saliva Antivenom

After a moment.

An entire cobra was devoured by the honey badger.

Little Curly Tail was surprised to see this. He went forward and raised his claws, preparing to scratch the honey badger. He wanted to see why this little fellow was so powerful.

Unexpectedly, not only did the honey badger not escape, it suddenly turned around, bared its teeth, and pounced at him\!

Little Curly Tail was frightened, but he did not run away. After taking a few steps back, he bared his teeth and acted like he was going to pounce on it and bite it.

The two little fellows faced each other like this, neither willing to be outdone.

After Chu Xiaoye helped Mei Mei suck out the venom in her wound, he smeared a lot of saliva on the wound. Then, he got up from the ground and called out to the lioness cub, wanting to see her condition.

He was not sure if his saliva was effective against snake venom.

If it was useless, this beautiful lioness cub would probably die.

Mei Mei tried to move her injured front leg and realized that her previously numb and powerless front leg seemed to have recovered\!

She was delighted and hurriedly got up from the ground, standing steadily. Then, she walked a few more times and even jumped a few times. She actually did not feel any pain or helplessness anymore, as if she was not injured\!

The lioness cub was extremely happy. She went in front of Chu Xiaoye and rubbed his head and body intimately.

In fact, she even stuck out her tongue and prepared to lick his face.

Chu Xiaoye slapped her head away with his claw and finally relaxed. After spitting a few more times, he turned around and looked at Little Curly Tail and the Brother Flat Top.

The two little fellows were baring their teeth. One took a step forward while the other took a step back. They advanced and retreated back and forth, each making threatening sounds, but none of them dared to attack easily.

Chu Xiaoye walked over and stood beside Little Curly Tail.

Mei Mei also walked over but did not show any ferocity.

After all, this little thing had just helped her take revenge and eat the despicable cobra.

Even when facing the three siblings, Brother Flat Top did not look afraid at all. He still bared his teeth and looked fierce.

Chu Xiaoye saw that this fellow seemed to be underage and was even younger than a normal honey badger. However, his ferocious character, which was not afraid of death, was not much weaker than an adult honey badger.

Seeing that they had the numerical advantage and that his brother was beside him, Little Curly Tail became bolder. He raised his claw and slapped the honey badger\!

The honey badger tilted its head and nimbly dodged it. Then, it was furious and pounced at Little Curly Tail with a whoosh\!

"Bam\!"

Before it could pounce any closer, Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and slapped its head, causing it to fall to the ground miserably.

Chu Xiaoye was shocked by his speed and strength\!

Little Curly Tail was overjoyed. Just as he was about to pounce on this little thing and beat it up, Chu Xiaoye slapped him on the head again\!

Little Curly Tail also fell to the ground.

"My strength has indeed increased a lot\!"

Chu Xiaoye looked at his claws and was secretly excited.

He did not seem to feel the least bit guilty about using his brother to experiment.

Little Curly Tail crawled on the ground with tears in his eyes and a wronged expression. He did not understand why his brother wanted to hit him again.

Chu Xiaoye ignored him and walked in front of Brother Flat Top with an eager expression.

Brother Flat Top was agile and extremely fast.

If he used it to practice his skills, he would definitely get twice the results with half the effort.

He let out a roar and bared his sharp teeth in provocation at Brother Flat Top. He even raised his claws to stroke Brother Flat Top's head.

To his surprise, the extremely ferocious and fearless Brother Flat Top turned around and ran away like it was a mouse that had seen a cat. With a whoosh, he crawled into two bushes full of thorns and disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He looked at his claws in confusion. Were they that scary? Even the most daring animal in Africa was scared away by his claws?

Little Curly Tail was still crawling on the ground, roaring and looking very pitiful.

He felt dizzy and saw stars, as if he had been slapped silly by his brother.

Chu Xiaoye walked to his side, raised his claws, and rubbed his head. He let out a roar, as if he was ordering, "Get up\!"

Little Curly Tail hung his head, looking wronged, and did not move.

Chu Xiaoye walked behind him again and raised his claws, pretending to slap his butt.

Little Curly Tail's expression changed as he jumped up hurriedly. His body swayed a few times before he could steady himself.

Chu Xiaoye felt guilty.

It seemed that his claw was indeed a little vicious. No wonder Brother Flat Top stopped playing with him.

Mei Mei went in front of him, her eyes full of admiration. She stuck out her little tongue again, wanting to lick his face.

Chu Xiaoye immediately turned around and aimed his butt at her. He curled his tail and prepared to fart.

Mei Mei was frightened and hurriedly ran away\!

Chu Xiaoye glanced at her and dashed up the tree with a whoosh, continuing to practice his skills.

His saliva could be used as a disinfectant and even antivenom.

Hence, he could lick others.

The female cub's saliva was useless. It was sticky and disgusting. He did not want to be licked\!

Although he had just licked this girl's thigh.

Mei Mei also climbed up the tree and followed behind him eagerly. She mimicked his movements and started practising, looking like a little fangirl.

Little Curly Tail rested for a while under the tree and climbed up as well. However, he did not dare to get too close to his brother, as he was afraid that his brother would slap him again.

He stood beside Mei Mei and started to practise these strange actions.

Soon, all the muscles in his body started to heat up.

"Roarâ€”"

The lion's roar sounded from a nearby mound, seemingly filled with anger.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a big tree and looked up. On the distant horizon, the four female lions hung their heads and returned exhausted.

They did not have any prey in their mouths.

It seemed that they had returned empty-handed again.

The lion paced angrily and anxiously on the slope, occasionally looking at the four female lions in the distance, and occasionally turning around to look at the cubs playing. His eyes were filled with iciness.

The lioness with a broken tail, who was watching over the children, suddenly stood up and looked at the lion warily and nervously.

She seemed to have keenly sensed something.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled.

Could this guy be so hungry that he was going to eat his children?

Or did he want to vent all his anger on cubs like them?

A hot and dangerous aura came from the air. The cubs who were playing seemed to have sensed something.

They quietened down.

The lion stood on a slope, its mane flying and its empty stomach heaving slightly. Its gaze was terrifyingly cold.

The air seemed to freeze in an instant.

There was a strange silence.

On the tree, Chu Xiaoye's sharp claws sank deeply into the branches under him.
