Chapter 439: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

When Chu Xiaoye chased close angrily, he saw the female lion jump up at lightning speed and catch a wild rabbit that was hunting in the forest.

Then, before the wild rabbit could die, he started eating.

Chu Xiaoye froze in place and looked at her in bewilderment.

Wasn't he escaping?

When everyone was eating previously, this female cub thought highly of her status and disdained to eat the food caught by the pride. Now, was she secretly coming out to hunt?

As Alisa bit the wild rabbit, she turned her head and looked at him teasingly, as if she was mocking him. "You thought that I would escape quietly, right?"

Chu Xiaoye was a little embarrassed, but he shamelessly walked over and cut the wild rabbit in half with his claw. Then, he picked up half of it and turned to leave, looking like he disdained to answer.

Alisa narrowed her eyes and looked at his retreating figure. She gritted her teeth. "Just you wait\!"

The night passed peacefully.

The wild dogs did not return. They seemed to have really abandoned their territory and fled.

After dawn, Chu Xiaoye brought the team forward.

The strange thing was that they did not see any animals along the way in such a good environment.

The lingering aura in the forest and the marks on the ground clearly indicated that there were many animals here, be it herbivores or carnivores.

But now, Chu Xiaoye had walked for a long time with the pride, but he did not see an animal.

In fact, the cries of the birds on the tree suddenly stopped.

The surrounding forest was strangely quiet.

Chu Xiaoye slowed down, his eyes flickering with golden light as he looked ahead solemnly.

There was only one possibility. There were terrifying ferocious beasts lurking here.

The animals that were already familiar with the environment instinctively felt danger, so they had already fled.

Blue eyes was on the left, Mixed Fur was on the right, and the Jerry brothers were at the back.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others and walked in front.

The pride instinctively sensed danger and slowed down, preparing for battle.

"Crack\!"

A slight noise suddenly came from the tree.

Chu Xiaoye looked up, his eyes flickering with a green light. He could clearly see a figure covered in green patterns hiding on a branch above him, almost merging with the dense leaves.

Even if one looked carefully, it was difficult to discover with the ordinary eye.

It was a mutated jaguar. The stripes on its body had already evolved to a green color and it was more adapted to the environment of this forest.

Soon, he discovered a second, third, and fourth one\!

The hiding places of the jaguars were not far away. They used their fur and the dense leaves around them as cover and hid there motionless, like thick branches.

The trees here were very big, and every one of them could be called a giant tree. Their thick trunks could even be hollowed out and made into a small hut of six to seven square meters. The trunks on it were lush and covered the sky, like old demon trees that had become spirits.

Those terrifying killers were hiding on it. Even their auras were similar to those of trees.

Even after so long, other than Chu Xiaoye, the members of the pride did not seem to have discovered them.

Chu Xiaoye did not stop and still walked forward as if he did not sense anything. He only turned around and looked at Little Curly Tail and the others, then at the other members of the pride.

Suddenly, the cry of a wild dog came from ahead.

Then, the wild dogs that had fled last night suddenly rushed over with a murderous aura and blocked their path.

There were more than twenty wild dogs in total. Usually, even a lone lion could scare them until they peed their pants and fled in panic. But now, facing so many lions, they were not afraid at all. As they cried out loudly, they ran left and right, looking fierce and ready to bite.

Unfortunately, this diversionary tactic to attract attention had long been seen through by Chu Xiaoye.

"Roarâ€”"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly roared and pretended to be preparing to lead the charge. However, he suddenly turned around and ran towards the forest on the right.

The pride did not hesitate and immediately followed behind, running quickly.

This action immediately stunned the twenty-over wild dogs that were preparing to lure the enemy deep.

After being stunned for a few seconds, the wild dogs immediately roared angrily and chased after him in exasperation.

The seven jaguars hiding on the tree in front of him had no choice but to jump up and chase from the tree.

The jaguars were even faster. Soon, they passed the wild dogs running on the ground and caught up to the pride.

At this moment, the pride were like stray dogs that did not look back and ran forward with all their might.

The seven jaguars jumped and flew on the tree, as agile as monkeys. Their amber eyes were filled with cold killing intent.

Soon, they caught up to the head of the pride.

Just as the seven jaguars were about to jump down from the sky to kill, a few figures suddenly flew out from the few lush trees. Just as they were focused on the ground and were about to jump down, they suddenly pounced at them\!

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Golden light flashed and the head of a jaguar was cut in half\!

A silver claw flashed past and a jaguar suddenly felt its stomach turn cold. Its vision turned black and it fell down. Blood sprayed and internal organs splashed\!

A tail that was like an iron whip suddenly flew out of the dense leaves and wrapped around the neck of a jaguar. Before the jaguar could react, it was sent flying. With a bang, it hit a big tree in the distance heavily. Its brain exploded on the spot and it died\!

Just as another jaguar jumped up from the tree, half of its face was scratched off by Mei Mei, who suddenly jumped out. With a scream, it fell from the tree and broke its neck\!

In order to showcase herself in front of the pride, Alisa took the initiative to participate in the ambush. As soon as she attacked, she broke the neck of a jaguar and slapped it "down there" with her tail.

In the blink of an eye, only one of the seven murderous jaguars was left.

The six corpses of the jaguars fell from the sky and happened to fall among the wild dogs that were shouting and rushing over. The group of wild dogs that had just been pretending to be strong immediately stopped in their tracks in shock\!

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur immediately turned around and returned with the pride\!

The wild dogs did not hesitate and immediately turned to flee with a scream.

There was still a jaguar left on the tree.

That jaguar was clearly smaller than the other jaguars, but its movements, speed, and reaction speed were much faster than that of the other six jaguars.

Even when Blue and his wife worked together to attack, it managed to dodge perfectly.

However, it was already surrounded and could not escape\!

Chu Xiaoye, Catherine, Mei Mei, Little Curly Tail, Molly, and the leopard sisters surrounded it on the big tree in the middle.

The Blue couple was only a meter away from it.

Just as Blue's eyes flashed and he was about to pounce on it again, this female jaguar, who seemed to have just become an adult, suddenly lay down, curled her tail and butt, and started to beg for mercy. Her trembling eyes were filled with pitifulness.

"Whoosh\!"

Unfortunately, Blue did not give her any chance. He pounced ferociously, ruthlessly raised his sharp claws, and grabbed her head\!

"Crack\!"

His sharp claws missed and broke the branch that the jaguar was standing on.

The jaguar jumped onto another branch at the side and lay down again. It let out a whimper, frowned, and pouted pitifully.

Blue was shocked and praised the jaguar's speed.

However, under the gaze of his wife and two daughters, he could not show any mercy to this female jaguar. He prepared to pounce again.

At this moment, the American leopard suddenly turned its head and looked at Chu Xiaoye pitifully. It whimpered and begged for mercy. Its roar was like the cry of spring every time Belia pestered Chu Xiaoye.

Before Chu Xiaoye could speak, Belia immediately roared angrily and pounced forward, her body filled with a sour smell.
