Chapter 213: The King's Choice

The battle stopped just like that.

Although the pride and hyenas had suffered casualties and wanted to tear each other into pieces, they knew that there was no point in continuing to risk their lives.

Under the attack of the sea python corpses, they finally woke up.

They had come here to kill the enemy in exchange for merits, not to take revenge.

If he continued to risk his life now, not only would he not get anything, he would also let the other fellows benefit from it.

Therefore, they had no choice but to stop fighting.

The lion king with mixed fur was very angry.

However, compared to the hyenas, he could at least bask in their glory.

After all, Chu Xiaoye and the others were in their team.

As for the hyenas, they lost everything. They did not obtain anything and even lost so many companions.

Most importantly, they were the first to discover this group of sea pythons\!

This was simply robbery\!

The hyenas were furious\!

The hyena queen was even more furious. She bared her fangs and let out a terrifying roar. Her gaze at Chu Xiaoye was filled with hatred and unwillingness.

Catherine and Blue stood behind Chu Xiaoye on the left and right, looking at them coldly.

The hyenas looked at their queen and waited for her orders.

The mixed fur lion king suddenly growled and bared its fangs. It looked at them provocatively, indicating that if they still wanted to fight, this king would fight with them at any time\!

Of course, he was on his team members' side.

The hyena queen looked at him coldly and then at her companions.

She knew that if this stalemate continued, not only would she not be able to complete the mission, her tribe would also suffer more casualties. At that time, it would probably be difficult for her to return alive.

Therefore, although she felt humiliated and unwilling, she had no choice but to end this conflict.

She decisively turned around and left with her remaining companions.

As for her companions who were lying on the ground and not completely dead, she did not look at them again and left resolutely and coldly.

The mixed fur lion king looked at her retreating figure and then at the heavily injured hyenas that had yet to die. It did not have the mood to attack again.

He turned around and looked at the young lion in front of him.

Now, he finally looked at this cub in a different light.

Not only was he good at climbing trees and was proficient in sneak attacks, but he was also cunning. He knew how to kill those sea pythons while they were fighting to the death.

This was definitely a lion spirit\!

"Kid, not bad. In the future, follow me."

The eyes of the mixed fur lion king expressed its admiration for him generously and took the initiative to invite him to join its pride.

Of course, there was also the powerful lioness cub.

However, Chu Xiaoye and Catherine ignored him.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the corpses all over the ground and thought about the true intentions of the upper echelons of the snow mountain.

When everyone came to this island to kill the enemy and an internal battle suddenly happened, did no one come out to stop them?

Furthermore, there was no need to put the hyenas and lions together. Both sides had always been enemies that would not rest until one of them was dead. Once they encountered each other, battles would inevitably occur.

This kind of thing could be avoided.

Could they be doing this on purpose?

"Roarâ€”"

Seeing that he was ignored by the two little things, the mixed fur lion king was furious. It bared its fangs and let out an angry growl.

However, no one bothered with him.

At this moment, the only surviving lioness struggled to stand up from the ground, but her hind legs turned limp and she squatted down again.

The bones of her two hind legs had already been bitten by the hyenas and her head and back were covered in bloody wounds.

In this situation, let alone continuing to follow them, even wanting to survive would probably be an extravagant hope.

As for the three lions, although their injuries were not fatal, they definitely could not walk anymore. They had to recuperate for at least three to four days.

The lion king looked at its injured companions and hesitated.

If he were to delay here, even the spotted hyenas would have more merits than him at that time. How could he have the face to be a majestic lion king?

This mission could not be lost\!

"Roarâ€”"

He roared at his companions and told them to wait for orders and rest here. As for him, he prepared to bring the other team members to continue searching for the sea enemies.

The three lions and the female lion looked at him pleadingly, hoping that he could stay here and wait for them.

If he left, then once an enemy appeared, they would be seriously injured and would have no combat strength at all. They would definitely die here.

The only surviving lioness looked pitifully at her king and let out a whimper as if she was begging.

She did not want to die, nor did she want to wait for death silently after being abandoned.

She hoped that her king could accompany them. At least, he could let her live another night.

The mixed fur lion king looked at her with a complicated gaze but did not relent. It turned around and roared at Chu Xiaoye, the three others, the two warthogs, and the three baboons, telling them to follow.

He turned around and strode away.

As a king, he naturally had to prioritize matters and make decisions.

When it was time to be heartless, he would be heartless. He could not be soft-hearted\!

The three baboons immediately followed behind him respectfully.

After the mixed fur lion king walked for a distance, it suddenly realized that something was wrong. When it turned around, it realized that other than the three baboons, there were no other members following behind.

The two young lions, the male leopard, and the two warthogs did not follow\!

The mixed fur lion king was first stunned, then furious and immediately roared.

The two warthogs trembled, but they still stood behind Chu Xiaoye and the other two and did not follow.

They were afraid of the mixed fur lion, and even more afraid of this young lion.

Chu Xiaoye ignored the lion king's roar and did not even look at him. Instead, he walked in front of the heavily injured lioness and observed the wounds on her body carefully.

The hind leg of this lioness was the most injured. Her joints were badly mutilated and two dense white bones were revealed.

Even if she could survive tonight, she would not be able to leave here alive.

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and patted her body, telling her to lie down and not squat.

This female lion thought that this young male lion was teasing and humiliating her. She immediately roared angrily, bared her fangs, and bit over.

"Bam\!"

Before she could extend her mouth, Chu Xiaoye slapped her and she fell to the ground.

The mixed fur lion king not far away was furious when it saw this scene. It immediately roared and rushed over.

Although he had already abandoned this lioness, she was his woman after all. How could he watch helplessly as another lion bullied her in front of him?

This kid was too arrogant. He had to be taught a good lesson\!

However, just as he was halfway there, two figures suddenly blocked his path and looked at him coldly.

Catherine flicked her sharp silver claws.

Blue bared his sharp fangs.

Clearly, in their eyes, they did not treat this mighty and tall mixed fur lion king as a king.

From the beginning to the end, they only had one king in their eyes\!
