Chapter 69: The Pride

The brave would win\!

The timid would flee in a hurry\!

Victory belonged to the pride.

They worked together, stayed strong, and defeated the enemy with their courage and strength.

Even though they were riddled with wounds and exhausted, they were still brave and strong with a magnificent aura\!

They were proud of themselves and the pride of lions\!

The entire pride could finally hold their heads high\!

This was a team victory and a team's honor\!

The depression and humiliation during this period of time were finally washed clean in this battle\!

Looking at the hyenas' panicked backs and the hyena corpses around them, pride and confidence appeared in the eyes of every lion.

They were still strong\!

They were still the kings of the grassland\!

The noisy forest gradually quietened down.

Chu Xiaoye turned his head and silently looked at every face beside him. He saw their determination and the confident light that shone in their eyes again. A warm current suddenly surged in his heart.

At this moment, he seemed to be proud of his current identity for the first time.

This was definitely not his doing.

This was the credit of the entire team\!

He liked the current pride.

The team's unity,courage and tenacity fascinated him, made his blood boil, and made him almost forget his past.

He was a lion.

A lion that was growing\!

In the future, he would also have a pride of his own.

His pride would also work together, be brave and strong, be unyielding, make his enemies tremble in fear, and make their enemies flee at the sight of him\!

He would be proud of himself as a lion\!

He believed that his life would be even more magnificent and colorful\!

The sun was already setting in the west.

Although the pride won, they also paid the price.

Other than the cold father, who the hyenas did not dare to attack, and Chu Xiaoye, who was hiding and attacking, everyone was injured.

Fortunately, none of them were fatal.

They rested for a while before starting to wolf down their prey.

Fresh meat was devoured by them in big mouthfuls, extinguishing the dry flames in their throats and filling their stomachs with hunger.

This time, everyone ate in an orderly manner and did not fight over it.

The cold father also acquiesced to the lionesses and cubs eating with him.

This was a rare harmonious scene for the pride.

The prey was very big.

They ate for a long time, and their stomachs were full. There was still some left.

The female lions used their sharp teeth to tear off the remaining flesh on the bones and prepared to bring them back for future consumption.

Although they liked to eat fresh meat, they naturally did not dare to waste it now that there was a lack of food.

Chu Xiaoye glanced at Mei Mei. Seeing that she was licking her wounds after eating and drinking her fill, he could only take action himself and go over to bite a piece of meat.

The lioness cub at home should still be hungry.

In the bushes at the back, the prey was getting lesser and lesser, and it was not easy to catch.

The reproduction of lions required fresh blood.

Although the growth of the lioness cub required a lot of time and a lot of food would be wasted, if she was raised, she could definitely become the most important and loyal member of the pride in the future.

Furthermoreâ€¦

Alsoâ€¦

Alright, it was better not to explain forcefully. Trying to cover up would only make it more conspicuous.

To be honest, he just felt that she was pitiful.

For now, he really could not throw away his humanity's mercy and gentleness.

He was trying to change.

After a short rest.

When the sun was about to set, the pride started to return.

Chu Xiaoye followed behind his mother with deer meat in his mouth, thinking about something.

Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei followed behind him and looked at him silently, their eyes filled with admiration.

Lars followed behind his cold father with his head lowered, looking like he had a lot on his mind.

After this battle, he seemed to have grown a little.

At the same time, he became even more afraid of his younger brother, who loved to climb trees. In fact, he went from trying to avoid him to being absolutely terrified of him.

He finally understood that even though he was taller and stronger than him now, he was definitely not his match.

He was a little dejected.

The pride walked very slowly.

They only returned to the camp when the sky turned dark.

The female lions placed the flesh they had brought back in the bushes beside them to avoid being discovered by the vultures and other carnivores.

They had been running around for a day and were injured. Soon, they lay in the bushes and fell asleep.

The cold father still dragged his tired body to a hill not far away and started to let out low roars to warn the wandering lions nearby.

Chu Xiaoye felt that it was not easy for him.

No matter when or where, he had to always be on guard against the enemy and be vigilant against danger.

When male lions grew up, they would be chased out of the pride and wandered around.

Many died while wandering.

Those who were lucky enough to survive would also wander for many years.

Only when they really became a strong lion would they dare to challenge the lion king in the pride and snatch his territory and pride.

However, many lions that succeeded in their challenge might not even be able to enjoy themselves for a few months before they were defeated and chased away by other more powerful wandering lions. They would then wander around again.

A lion's life was actually much more pitiful than a lioness's.

They always lived in vigilance and anxiety, vigilance, and combat.

Therefore, a lion king's personality was mostly silent and cold, cold and heartless, and temperamental.

As a bystander, Chu Xiaoye naturally understood and sympathized with him.

However, as a member of the pride, he could not help but feel indignant about what the lion usually did.

He had no choice.

If it did not happen to him, outsiders would never understand.

In the future, if nothing unexpected happened, he and Little Curly Tail would experience everything this father experienced.

Of course, a handsome and cool cub like him would definitely be different from the rest and be extraordinary.

Catherine was sleeping in the bushes not far away.

Chu Xiaoye threw the meat in his mouth in front of Mei Mei and let her bring it over to her.

One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions.

He did not want to be misunderstood by the lioness cub that he had designs on her.

He did not have any intentions towards her\!

He only wanted her to be grateful and stay in the pride to be a slave and contribute to the pride for the rest of her life.

It would be even better if it was his pride.

Mei Mei bit on the meat and walked in front of Catherine. She put the meat down and rubbed her head against her, letting her get up to eat.

Catherine opened her eyes and raised her head, but her eyes were red and her body was trembling slightly. She looked weak and seriously ill.

She could not stand up.

In the evening, when she climbed down from the Baobab tree, she felt dizzy and her entire body was hot.

She felt powerless, her entire body was burning, and her bones were aching. She felt like she was about to die.

She raised her head and looked vaguely at Mei Mei in front of her. Then, she looked at the familiar figure not far away, sad and in despair.

She did not want to die.

She had not seen enough of him and had yet to repay him.
