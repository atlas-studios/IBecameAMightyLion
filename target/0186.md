Chapter 186: Tide of Mutations\!

Peace was precious between neighbors.

Chu Xiaoye did not want to kill them all and attract more trouble.

As long as the other party admitted his sovereignty over this territory and did not dare to covet it casually, that would be enough.

His requirements were not high.

This territory that was about 30 square kilometers was enough for him to stand steadily and develop slowly.

His current team was weak and had too few members. Even if he had more territory, he could not manage it. Instead, he had to face more challenges and dangers every day.

The neighboring lions might be able to help them chase away or scare away many wandering lions.

Therefore, as long as the other party did not go overboard, he would not kill them.

Catherine dragged the zebra back to the camp in the bushes.

When the Chino brothers saw that the female cub had actually returned alone with such a big prey, they were surprised and afraid.

What was surprising was that in the future, this pride would finally have a lioness to help hunt.

What they feared was naturally the strength and ferocity of this female cub.

They immediately walked over eagerly and swayed their butts at Chu Xiaoye, looking fawning as they looked covetously at the prey.

They knew that their boss was the king of this territory.

No matter how powerful this female cub was, it was not as powerful as Boss. No matter how ferocious she was, she was obedient and clever in front of Boss and did not even dare to flare up.

Therefore, they only had to please their boss.

However, they clearly did not know that their boss would rather throw away the unfinished prey than let them eat it.

As for the female cub, she would never give them the prey she caught.

Chu Xiaoye ignored them and lay on the ground, starting to eat.

He still only ate the muscles of his prey, and almost all the meat on the ribs and thighs were eaten by him.

Catherine stood at the side and looked at him gently.

Being able to hunt for him and do things for him was something she had always dreamed of.

Back then, her life was saved by the prey he threw down.

At that time, she thought that he really did not want to eat the thigh of the prey that was thrown away, so he threw it away. It was only after he left that she suddenly realised why he did so.

It turned out that he wasted food every night on purpose so that she could fill her stomach and not starve to death.

Every night, when he was hunting in the forest and training, he knew that she was following behind and secretly learning skills.

He cared for her silently, protected her, and made her gradually stronger and stronger from the loneliness and fragility of losing her pride and mother. She gradually grew and finally survived.

Hence, her life and everything about her was his.

She knew that she could not be soft-hearted in this cruel world.

As for him, he was too kind. He could not be cruel in many things.

It was impossible to become a true king like this.

Therefore, she decided to be his claws. She was cruel and never soft-hearted\!

She would taint all the blood that he was unwilling to taint\!

If he could not be cruel enough to kill, she would kill\!

Even if she had to become a bloodthirsty and heartless killing machine and be feared and hated by all her companions, she was willing\!

She wanted him to become a true king\!

She wanted to help him protect every inch of this territory\!

She looked up at the distant grassland, her dark eyes flickering with determination.

When Chu Xiaoye finished eating and was about to leave, the Chino brothers immediately ran over excitedly.

The rule of lions eating had always been that the lion ate first and the lionesses ate last.

However, just as they approached their prey, Catherine suddenly bared her fangs and stared at them coldly.

The Chino brothers immediately stopped in their tracks and looked at her in fear.

This female cub did not follow the rules?

They could only turn around and look at their boss for help. They hoped that their boss would uphold justice and slap this unruly lioness cub so that she would not be too arrogant\!

"Bang\! Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye slapped them twice and told them to scram.

He had long told them that they had to catch their own prey in the future. Otherwise, they could only wait to starve to death\!

He could never let them eat the food he caught.

As for Catherine, she could not become a slave to the lions like other lionesses\!

Because they were not worthy\!

The Chino brothers immediately lowered their heads, turned around, and left resentfully.

Chu Xiaoye looked coldly at their backs, turned around, and climbed up the Baobab tree to find a branch to sleep on.

Catherine raised her head and looked at him drunkenly, her heart filled with sweetness.

He was protecting her.

The pride next door did not come looking for trouble again.

This new territory temporarily returned to calm.

Ten days later.

When Chu Xiaoye woke up in the evening breeze, he suddenly realized that the ring of golden fur on his neck had grown even more golden fur at some point in time.

This tuft of golden fur was extremely striking and dazzling among his grayish-yellow fur.

When the breeze blew, it was like a flame jumping around his neck; or like a golden fire butterfly dancing on his body.

When he climbed down from the tree, Catherine immediately stared at him in a daze, unwilling to look away for a long time.

Chu Xiaoye sighed inwardly.

Sometimes, being handsome was a burden.

The wounds on his body had completely healed and he had just finished sleeping. He was full of energy and decided to hunt personally today.

On the grass near the river, a group of water buffaloes were leisurely eating grass.

He walked out of the bushes and walked towards the river.

Catherine followed closely behind like his shadow.

When they were about to approach the water buffaloes, an extremely loud thunder suddenly came from the distant sky.

Then, black clouds quickly floated over from above the sea.

Before long, it covered the clearness of the grassland.

The light immediately dimmed.

The dark clouds were still endless and drifted endlessly from the sky of the sea. They did not stop on the grassland but quickly drifted towards the distant mountain range.

Chu Xiaoye's heart skipped a beat. He raised his head and looked at the dark clouds on the distant mountain range with a burning gaze.

Then, those dark clouds drifted across the mountain range and continued to drift into the distance. They continued endlessly, like a black army.

Chu Xiaoye was delighted to see this scene.

It was going to rain\!

On the other side of the mountain, the rainy season finally arrived\!

The grassland, which had been dry for a long time, was finally about to start to regain its vitality. The animals had finally survived the most difficult moment\!

He was sincerely happy.

Little Curly Tail and the others were probably already waiting for the rain to fall.

Since the rainy season was approaching, there would be an endless amount of grass and prey along the way. At that time, he would not have to worry about being starved and thirsty on the way here when he brought the pride over.

Even if it was a long journey, the two young cubs should be fine.

In another month, when the grassland over there grew lush grass again and the animals moved back, he would set off to welcome the pride.

As for this territory, he would let Catherine and the Chino brothers guard it for the time being.

Even if a wandering lion invaded, if there were not many of them, with Catherine's ability and the favorable terrain of this forest, there should be no problem.

"Boom\!"

A thunderclap suddenly exploded in the sky above him\!

Then, heavy rain fell.

The water buffaloes were still eating grass leisurely and were not affected by the rain.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine were instantly drenched.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was hesitating about whether to go to the bushes to hide from the rain, he suddenly realized that there were red splashes in the river not far away.

The rain poured down and water splashed all over the river like blood.

Chu Xiaoye immediately brought Catherine over.

When he came to the river, he was shocked to discover that there was no problem with the river, but this rainstorm.

The rain that fell from the sky was like drops of blood. From the initial transparent color, it turned bright red.

The rain became heavier and the raindrops became brighter and brighter\!

The surface of the river was quickly dyed red\!

Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and caught a few drops of bright red rain. He placed them under his nose and sniffed, but there was no smell.

He stuck out his tongue and licked it. It was also like rain and there was nothing unusual.

He raised his head and looked into the distance. The entire sky had turned from its original darkness to a faint red color. The heavy rain, be it near or far, was like bright red blood.

Right at this moment, a black figure suddenly drifted over from upstream. It was rising and falling and was about six to seven meters long. It looked extremely huge.

When it drifted close, Chu Xiaoye was shocked to discover that it was the corpse of a huge strange fish\!

This strange fish was completely black and its mouth was full of sharp fangs. Four strong legs were growing on its abdomen and its entire body was covered in black scales.

Its head had two rows of teeth marks and was badly mutilated. There were also many scratches on its abdomen, and its internal organs were almost exposed.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the teeth and scratches and his heart skipped a beat. These wounds seemed to be left by the teeth and claws of a cat.

In other words, this huge strange fish was killed by a certain feline.

However, why was the corpse not eaten?

Soon, the strange fish's corpse drifted down the river into the distance.

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked into the distance upstream.

Every mountain at the edge of the grassland seemed to have branches that flowed into this river. However, the main river of this river extended from the distant majestic snow mountain that was on the verge of the sea.

Could it be that the corpse of this huge strange fish drifted down from there?

Thinking of the beast tide phenomenon on the grassland that day and the dozen or so mysterious white lions, he felt that this matter was probably not as simple as hunting.

The leaders of the various animals on the grassland and the core members followed the ten-over white lions to the majestic snow mountain. What was the reason?

The herbivores and carnivores suddenly formed an alliance. Now, such strange giant fish had appeared here again. Could it be that an ocean species had invaded and they were fighting together?

"Whoosh\!"

Just as he was standing by the river letting his imagination run wild, a wave suddenly flew up from the water\!

At the same time, a huge green crocodile suddenly jumped out of the water. It opened its mouth and pounced at him\!

"Bang\!"

Before he could attack, Catherine had already jumped up and suddenly slapped the crocodile's head\!

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere and the crocodile fell heavily into the water. A deep claw mark appeared on its head\!

It immediately fled in panic.

Catherine bared her fangs and was about to pounce down to continue hunting when Chu Xiaoye raised his claws and stopped her.

This river was close to his territory, and the crocodiles in the river were his neighbors. They could help him stop many carnivores, and there was no need to kill them.

The rain was still pouring.

Chu Xiaoye did not have the mood to hunt anymore and immediately brought Catherine back to the bushes.

Although the rainwater had turned bright red like blood, the color immediately paled when it landed on the ground and it quickly turned into ordinary rainwater.

Other than the river turning red, there were not many changes in the grass and bushes.

Chu Xiaoye walked into the bushes and observed carefully. He realized that the raindrops on the leaves were initially bright red, but in a few seconds, they would all fade. The color inside seemed to be quickly absorbed by the leaves.

Almost all the trees on the grass were like this.

In fact, Chu Xiaoye realized that the rain that fell on Catherine was like this too.

What were those red things?

This was not the only place that had a red rain. The distant grassland, mountains, and even the other side of the mountain might be like this.

Chu Xiaoye walked in the bushes and thought as he looked at the red raindrops falling around him.

Catherine looked at him for a while, then turned around and walked out of the bushes. She braved the heavy rain and walked towards the water buffaloes.

Not long after.

She knocked down a water buffalo, emptied its internal organs, and bit off its neck, head, and butt. Then, she dragged the remaining flesh back.

She remembered everything he did not like to eat.

She would never eat it either.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was thinking about something in the forest, a fruit shell suddenly fell from above and hit him in the head.

"Roar —"

Belita lay on the tree, biting her fruit and looking at him in schadenfreude, as if she was mocking him. "Kid, why do you look like you've lost your soul and your wife died?"

Chu Xiaoye looked up at her and was about to go up and teach her a lesson when the grass beside him moved and another female leopard walked out. She walked elegantly and twisted her butt, letting out a soft and coquettish cry like a cat.

Belia walked in front of him, lowered her head, and lay down. She could not stop twisting her butt like a little female dog in heat.

Belita, who was on the tree, revealed a disdainful look. She threw down another fruit and hit her head.

Belia raised her head and glared at her fiercely. She turned her butt at Chu Xiaoye again with a fawning look, as if she was saying, "Handsome and strong king, please accept me\!"

"Pfft—"

Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and spat out black smoke mercilessly at her fawning and excited face\!

Then, he left.

If a leopard did not look like a leopard, how could it be allowed\!

"Ugh —"

Belia lay on the ground and vomited\!

On the tree, Belita immediately curled her tail and roared, letting out mocking laughter at Belia's misfortune.

When Belia finished vomiting and stood up, preparing to pester Chu Xiaoye again, an icy killing intent suddenly came from the side\!

A female cub whose mouth was full of blood stood in the grass like a ghost without a sound, staring at her coldly.

Belia's heart turned cold and she felt inexplicably terrified.

"Whoosh—"

She immediately climbed up the tree at the side and stood at the highest point. Then, she lowered her head and roared at the female cub under the tree, her roar filled with provocation.

It seemed to be saying, "Little thing, what are you looking at? Have you never seen such a charming little leopard? Your king is already infatuated with me and has peed his pants and been farting at me\! You're so jealous\!"

Unexpectedly, just as she stopped crying, a figure flashed in front of her. The female cub under the tree had already come onto the tree and stood beside her\!

"Wu… Wuwu…"

"Sister, I was wrong…"

Belia trembled, her eyes wide with fear.

The female cub's climbing speed was actually so perverted\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

Belita continued to gloat on the tree beside her, as if she was encouraging Catherine to beat her sister.

She knew this female leopard and was her friend.

At least, that was what she thought.

Catherine turned around and looked at her. Her eyes flickered and she looked at the little leopard in front of her again. She wanted to bare her teeth and threaten her to stay away from her king. However, in the end, she did not show anything. She turned around and climbed down the tree.

It was not her place to interfere in his matters.

She was only his claws, his shadow, and his killer.

She had no right to threaten his friends.

She only needed to do what she had to do and stay by his side forever.

Catherine jumped down from the tree and walked into the grass. She bit the water buffalo's corpse and left silently.

On the tree.

Belia was trembling in fear. After Catherine walked far away, she cried out in anger, indicating that she was not afraid of this lioness cub at all. She just did not want to hurt their relationship.

The rain was still pouring. Red raindrops fell endlessly in the bushes, on the grassland, in the mountains, and further away.

The strange thing was that the blood-like setting sun was still hanging on the horizon. It was not covered nor did it fall.

In the orchard.

The cute violent bear and her son were eating the fruits that had been hit by the rain with relish.

The red rain fell on the green fruits and quickly turned transparent.

The little cute violent bear Yu Yu bit a fruit with a crack and swallowed it whole.

Then, he ate a second one.

Chu Xiaoye ate the fresh steak Catherine brought back and listened to the pitter-patter of rain. He suddenly felt a little sleepy and yawned a few times.

The distant sky seemed to be dyed by blood and was terrifyingly red.

The blood-like setting sun on the horizon was reflected like a giant blood eye, looking at the world strangely and coldly.
