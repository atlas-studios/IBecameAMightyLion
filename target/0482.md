Chapter 482: The Mysterious Little Girl

It was snowing.

The grass was lush and the trees were still green.

The cold north wind suddenly brought snow without warning.

Overnight, the world was snow-white.

The river seemed to have stopped flowing and the animals became much fewer.

Chu Xiaoye faced the cold wind and stood by the river, thinking day after day.

The fur on his body was still as if he had just come out of the cave that day. It was only a short inch and did not grow as he had expected.

Perhaps he could be called Brother Flat Top or the Flat Top King now.

It had been more than a month since the last incident.

Blue Eyes and Mixed Fur miraculously survived and recovered.

This was naturally because of his saliva.

However, Chu Xiaoye felt that the greatest credit should belong to the human girl.

Although he did not know what method the other party used.

From the first time the little girl made the timid big black bear suddenly filled with courage and strength, he knew that the little girl was not simple.

However, he did not expect things to develop beyond his expectations.

During the days he slept in the cave, he breathed in the fragrance emitted by the little girl. He had seen many strange things in his dreams.

Perhaps it was really a dream.

However, when he heard the human's voice in the saber-toothed tiger's head, he suddenly felt that perhaps it was not a dream.

This new grassland might already be a new world.

It turned out that that world might have suddenly disappeared while they were crossing mountains and crossing long distances.

Perhaps they had unconsciously arrived in another space.

Of course, this was just a guess.

However, he had to understand.

A cold wind blew and snow fluttered. The world was boundless.

He raised his head, his eyes flickering with a green light. Through the snow, he looked at the distant snow mountain that towered into the clouds.

On the top of the snow mountain, a strange light flickered in the clouds. It was filled with an unfathomable sense of mystery, attracting certain energy and desire in his body and making them restless.

After seeing so many magical and absurd things, his mentality had already changed drastically.

His former dreams and aspirations suddenly became small and childish, making him feel ridiculous.

The king of the grassland and the king of beasts were ultimately just animals that ate raw meat and drank blood.

A true king did not just command a few animals and live a primitive and bloody life in the wilderness.

Perhaps, he could stand higher and walk further.

It had been more than a month and the injured members of the pride had mostly recovered.

The brave and cute violent bear and son pair also slept underground.

Little Curly Tail would go out to patrol every day to prevent new enemies from invading.

Mei Mei and the female lions were in charge of hunting.

The cold father still liked to mark the territory.

As for Alisa, she was still idle.

The life of the pride started to repeat.

The neighboring lions had already bowed their heads and did not dare to take another step forward.

The leopard family of four suddenly disappeared.

Chu Xiaoye searched the bushes, the entire territory, and the distant grassland, but he did not find their figures.

They disappeared silently and without warning.

However, Chu Xiaoye remembered that when he was sleeping in the cave that day, he seemed to have heard the long cry of a bird from outside.

Chu Xiaoye thought of the snow eagles he had seen on the original grassland.

Could it be that the snow mountain had summoned them?

"King, you're leaving, right?"

The human girl's voice suddenly came from behind.

She rode on the big black bear's back, still wearing the thin and clean white dress, as if she did not know the cold.

Snow fell on her golden hair and clothes, quickly melting.

Under the light of the snow, her already white skin was like perfect porcelain, so beautiful that it was suffocating.

However, Chu Xiaoye was not human, so he did not feel any discomfort.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at her in confusion.

Although he had indeed thought of leaving and going to the snow mountain to find the truth and what he was thinking, he had yet to make up his mind.

The little girl blinked her beautiful big eyes, her blue pupils reflecting his shadow. A mysterious smile that did not match her age appeared on her young and delicate face. "I have to leave. Furthermore, Annie will be with you."

Chu Xiaoye did not like to be led by the nose, let alone treated by an underage girl with such confidence and certainty.

"Sorry, This King will not leave. I will never leave\!"

He clearly expressed his intentions and was very determined. "However, if you want to leave, you're welcome at any time. Take care."

The little girl was not angry. Instead, she narrowed her eyes with a smile, looking confident.

She patted the big black bear's neck. The big black bear turned around and carried her away.

After taking a few steps, she suddenly turned around and pretended to be puzzled. "I want to ask, how many years can a lion live at most?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment, not knowing why she suddenly asked this question.

A lion could live for more than ten years at most. Even if he was a mutated lion, he would live for more than twenty years at most.

The little girl blinked and continued, "An ordinary lion can only live for more than ten years at most. As for you, you're not an ordinary lion. Let's extend your life a little. Fifty years, or sixty years, or seventy years, like ordinary humans."

A cold wind blew. Chu Xiaoye looked at her and suddenly realized that the two ears the little girl revealed seemed to have changed. They were as sharp as foxes\!

At this moment, the little girl suddenly smiled. Her bright eyes, white teeth, and golden hair danced. "Then, if I tell you to leave with me, you might be able to live longer, more than a hundred years, or even more, and it will be more exciting. Are you still unwilling?"

Chu Xiaoye froze in place and looked at her in a daze, his heart filled with shock.

If it was in the past, Chu Xiaoye would not even believe a word she said when he first saw this little girl.

But now, he had no choice but to believe it.

The changes in the big black bear and the little girl's body already explained everything.

In this world, wonders were everywhere\!

At this moment, anything was possible\!

"If you're unwilling, I'll go find the other lions. There's only one spot. Time waits for no one."

The little girl rode the big black bear and left, humming a passionate and ancient song. Her long golden hair fluttered wantonly in the whistling cold wind and the falling snow.

She did not look like a child.

"Yes\! I'm willing\!"

Chu Xiaoye chased after her without care. He shouted in his heart and let out a strange sound.

It was not a lion's roar, but rather the sounds of humans garbling when they were in a hurry to speak.

"Coo â€”"

A loud cry that could pierce through metal suddenly sounded at the highest point of the super huge tree, causing Chu Xiaoye's eardrums to buzz and his breathing was almost choked in an instant.

As for the little girl, her singing was still the same.
