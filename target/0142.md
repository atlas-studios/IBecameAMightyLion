Chapter 142: The Aura of a King

Scram\!

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with it and threw it a disdainful look.

Whether you are male or female, what has it got to do with me?

Eat your leaves\!

Chu Xiaoye could not be bothered with this group of tailing bugs. He walked under a bush and lay down. He closed his eyes and prepared to rest.

At this moment.

The female lion and her daughter also walked over and lay at the side.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately opened his eyes and roared, telling them to walk further away\!

He was not a JPman\!

The female lion and her daughter were frightened. They hurriedly got up, walked to another patch of grass at the side, and lay down.

They only wanted to be close to him and be safer.

After those unconscious lions woke up, they did not know if they would come and find trouble with them again.

The Chino brothers consciously walked not far away and lay down, acting as bodyguards.

The little elephant swung its tail and was eating everywhere.

As for the other lionesses in this territory, they stood in the distance and looked at him in a daze.

Perhaps they were thinking that this young lion would be their king in the future. From the looks of it, he did not seem to be as cruel as the fellows in the male lion alliance.

Not long after.

The three lions that had fainted woke up.

They opened their eyes, shook their heads, and got up from the ground. They looked around in confusion, and their gazes were fixed on the sleeping young lion.

The memory just now did not fade.

The young male cub only used a few slaps to make them fall to the ground and fall unconscious.

They had no chance to retaliate\!

They froze in place, looking at each other, then turned their heads at the same time to look at Lars at the side, their eyes terrified and suspicious.

He seemed to be saying, "Fifth Brother, are you sure that this is your younger brother?"

Lars looked at the figure with a complicated gaze and remembered the unbelievable performances of this brother in the pride of the cold father before he came out to wander.

At that time, he vaguely had the aura of a king and was not afraid of anyone.

Now, even though he had come out to wander, he was still living so brilliantly. He was riding an elephant and protected by two adult lions and his attacks were world-shaking.

Lars could not understand. They were all from the same pride and had the blood of the same father. Why was he stronger and better than him from the beginning?

Tonight was supposed to be a feast for the king. He had been filled with endless excitement and hope, preparing to start a new life. But now, it had all turned into envy and jealousy.

A big brother like him could not even compare to his younger brother.

His younger brother had become the eldest brother, and he, the eldest brother, had become the younger brother.

How ironic.

Tonight, he was destined to be unable to sleep.

Seeing that he was distracted and did not seem to have a good relationship with the young cub, the four lions were a little disappointed.

They originally wanted him to invite that powerful kid to join their Lion Alliance.

Now, it seemed impossible.

The other party was sleeping there and did not do anything to them, nor did he show any intention of occupying this territory and these female lions.

She did not know what he wanted to do.

They were still a little uneasy and did not dare to go forward nor were they willing to leave. They could only stand in place and wait silently.

The female lions looked at them one moment and then at the young male lion the next. They seemed to be confused.

Who was their true king?

This pride did not seem to be preparing to give up.

Could it be that they still wanted to fight a decisive battle?

The hot and bloody night passed quietly in this strange atmosphere.

After dawn.

The young lion stood up from under the bushes.

The four lions and the female lions became nervous.

Lars also looked at him nervously.

However, he did not look at them again. He turned around and walked out of the bushes towards the distant grassland.

He raised his front palm and waved it under the fiery red morning sun as if he was bidding farewell to his former big brother.

The little elephant, who was still eating leaves, hurriedly followed.

The Chino brothers followed closely.

The lioness and her daughter left without hesitation.

The five members of the Lion Alliance looked at them in a daze, finding it unbelievable.

Did they leave just like that?

Waving his feet and not bringing away anything?

Oh, no. He only brought away a mother and daughter?

Lars stood in place, looking straight at the figure until it slowly disappeared into the distant grassland.

He stood in place for a long time.

He walked alone in the morning and rode the elephant in the afternoon.

This way, he could move his limbs every day, prevent the flexibility of his limbs from decreasing, and prevent laziness.

The pursuers seemed to have given up.

For the sake of speed, Chu Xiaoye advanced directly from the grassland.

The mountain range in front of him was getting closer and closer. He could already see the trees on the mountainside clearly.

On the top of the mountain, there was a black cloud.

The clouds had just drifted over the mountaintop when they dispersed.

The dry season here was still not over.

Over at the mountain range, it should have rained long ago.

That was the territory of his dream\!

The lioness and her daughter, who were following behind, went further and further away.

The young cub, who had been running around the entire day under the hot sun, was hot, tired, hungry, and thirsty. She could not move anymore.

The lioness accompanied her and looked at them miserably and helplessly.

Chu Xiaoye did not look back at them. Instead, he instructed the little elephant to walk towards the river.

He needed to drink water and eat something.

He was already a year old and was growing healthily. When the mane on his neck appeared, it would be the true start of his journey as a king.

He hoped that at that time, he would conquer a large territory and bring a group of fierce and powerful subordinates through this grassland to return to his former birthplace and bring them over.

He hoped that at that time, even if he did not attack, he could make the other competitors and the herbivores on the grassland tremble in fear just by standing there\!

He believed that the day would come when he could do that.

However, he seemed to be doing quite well now.

When he appeared on the hill riding his little elephant and bringing two lions with him, the animals at the foot of the hill who were squeezing by the river to drink water immediately raised their heads and looked at him in unison.

Their gazes were filled with fear and shock.

The little elephant carried him down the hill and walked towards the river.

The Chino brothers, their manes fluttering, followed behind him with dignified gazes from the left and right.

The animals in front, be it herbivores or carnivores, all took the initiative to make way.

The originally noisy river suddenly became strangely quiet.

The little elephant walked to the river and stuck its nose into the water, starting to suck in water.

At this moment, even the crocodiles hiding in the river instinctively retreated.

On the hill, another female lion and her daughter appeared.

They looked exhausted.

Especially the cub that was only a few months old. It was trembling as it walked and looked like it would fall at any time.

They also walked down the hill from where he had just walked and walked towards the river.

They walked very slowly but calmly, as if the other did not exist.

The passageway was still there.

Not far from the two sides of the passageway stood a group of wild dogs, a few hyenas, and even a wandering lion and other carnivores.

However, they only watched silently, having no intention of going over.

The female lion and her daughter walked to the river and stood beside the little elephant, starting to drink water with their heads lowered.

The other animals by the river watched this scene in a daze. All of them were frozen in place, as if they had suddenly discussed it. They tacitly did not make any noise and stopped all the battles.

This was a strange scene and also an unusual dusk.

The aura of a king was starting to show.
