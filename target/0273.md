Chapter 273: The King's Reward\!

The morning sun rose.

A new day, a new light.

Chu Xiaoye brought the team to the foot of the mountain and pitched camp here. He prepared to open a new home and wait for the other homeless pride.

The team needed to rest and expand.

They had to wait for more lions and more warriors to join them.

The victory last night did not make Chu Xiaoye dizzy.

He knew that in order to completely defeat those black lions and chase them out of this grassland, he had to have more warriors.

The grassland was covered in the darkness of the black pride. Only this land was still bright.

More lions that had lost their homes would arrive one after another.

The female lions, young cubs, and the old, weak, and sick in this team needed to have a land that could temporarily calm them.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to build a new territory here as a base camp to accept new members, protect the weak, resist the enemy, and prepare to counterattack.

More than four hundred lions split up. Under the lead of Lars and One-eyed, they were divided into six small groups that occupied the six grasslands at the foot of the mountain.

This land was about 100 square kilometers and was filled with lush grass and groups of herbivores.

Every small group could catch delicious food, or they could temporarily cross each other's territory to hunt, or they could go to the forest at the back.

As for Chu Xiaoye, he brought the pride of the cold father, Mixed Fur, and the other six lions and stationed them in the territory at the front of the team, always vigilant of the enemy's arrival.

There was a lush forest here that was much larger than the one in the territory of the cold father's pride.

Chu Xiaoye assigned tasks to Little Curly Tail, the mixed fur, and the others. Every night, there would be three members patrolling the vicinity together. At the slightest movement, they would let out a roar alarm.

There were lions stationed at the border of every small team. Once they heard the alarm, they would let out rapid roars. One after another, they spread throughout the entire territory like a beacon.

This way, everyone could immediately know the arrival of the enemy and quickly enter a defensive state.

If there were not many enemies, Chu Xiaoye could bring the members of the pride of the cold father and defeat them directly. If there were too many enemies, they would sound the alarm as they retreated and gather with the pride behind to resist the enemy.

After a day of work, the six small groups finally had their own new territory and knew their respective missions.

In the evening.

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine, Tilly, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and the other six lions to ambush a water buffalo herd.

There were about thirty water buffaloes in this group. They were all huge and fat. Although they were not as exaggerated as the water buffaloes on the other side of the mountain range, most of them had mutated to nearly two tons and were almost as big as former elephants.

In order to reward everyone for their courage last night and for the reward of ascending to the throne, Chu Xiaoye decided to catch all these water buffaloes in one fell swoop and not let go of a single one.

He first brought Little Curly Tail and the others to make many tripes with vines in the bushes. He also let the big pit dig many small pits and make many hoof pits.

After making all the preparations, he let the mixed fur and the other big fellows lie in ambush in the grass around the trap.

Then, he personally brought Little Curly Tail and Catherine to provoke the violent giant water buffaloes.

When he scratched the water buffalo leader's butt, the water buffaloes were furious. They immediately mooed and swung their tails, running towards him aggressively with their iron hooves.

The ground immediately trembled and grass flew everywhere\!

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately roared and let out a loud alarm. He quickly ran into the bushes.

This roar immediately came out and reached outside the border and into the ears of another group.

"Roar\!"

The lion in another pride immediately roared and sent the alarm to the next pride.

Soon, all the lions received the alarm and quickly rushed towards the territory of the cold father's pride.

At this moment.

Chu Xiaoye had already brought Little Curly Tail and Catherine into the bushes.

The water buffaloes relied on their huge bodies and strength to strengthen their team. They did not take the three cubs seriously at all and continued to charge through the bushes, venting their anger and divine might\!

They wanted to let these damn carnivores know that they were no longer like before. They had long become stronger, more united, and more intelligent\!

Whoever dared to provoke them was definitely courting death\!

They wanted to let these three daring and blind little fellows' entire family die\!

"Moo\!"

Under the lead of the water buffalo leader, all the water buffaloes charged ferociously in the bushes\!

Crack\!

The small tree broke and branches flew everywhere\!

The grass fell into mud and the flowers stepped into the dust.

"Bang\!"

As the two giant water buffaloes were running, they suddenly tripped on a vine on the road. Their front legs bent and their huge bodies fell to the ground\!

Before they could struggle up, Catherine suddenly jumped out of the grass beside them with a whoosh. With a silver flash, she cut open their stomachs\!

Then, he turned around and ran forward unhurriedly.

The two water buffaloes that had their stomachs cut open immediately cried out miserably and struggled violently on the ground.

The other water buffaloes were furious and immediately chased after Catherine ferociously.

In the end.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

Some small pits suddenly appeared on the ground\!

Because they were running too quickly and were too big, the moment the hooves sank in, their bodies tilted and they fell to the ground.

At this moment, the mixed fur and the others immediately jumped out from the grass at the side. They swung their claws and pierced through the cowhide on their abdomen. With a sudden slash, their skin and flesh were lacerated\!

These water buffaloes did not die.

However, mixed fur and the others did not continue fighting. They immediately turned around and left.

The injured water buffalo struggled to get up. Its abdomen was dripping with blood and it was even more furious. It actually continued to chase ferociously.

Even if a few turned around to escape because of pain and fear, they had just walked out of the bushes when they saw more lions.

All the lions rushed towards the bushes.

As for the thirty-over giant water buffaloes, they had already turned from their initial ferocious charge and flaunting their might to limping and fleeing in all directions.

However, they were all injured. As they walked, they bled. Many water buffaloes fell to the ground before they could walk out of the bushes.

As for the water buffaloes that walked out of the bushes, they suddenly realized in fear that a large number of lions had suddenly appeared outside and were looking at them covetously.

More than four hundred lions gathered together, causing the injured giant water buffaloes to fall into despair.

Soon, an extremely sumptuous super water buffalo dinner officially started under the evening sun and the announcement of their handsome king\!

Men, women, old, young, male, female, big, small, furless, and all ate heartily, their mouths filled with blood\!
