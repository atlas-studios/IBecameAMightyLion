Chapter 401: Untitled

Dinner was not bad.

Monkey brain, monkey meat, and monkey blood.

Chu Xiaoye did not show mercy to these fearless monkeys.

Out of the twenty-over monkeys, more than ten were left behind and turned into dinner for the pride.

For a moment, blood filled the air and debris covered the ground.

Chu Xiaoye personally brought a monkey corpse in front of the little girl and let her enjoy it. He stared meaningfully at the expression on her face.

The little girl only hesitated for a few seconds before taking out the sharp knife.

Although the monkey's appearance and actions were rather similar to humans, it was not a human. The little girl did not have any worries.

Furthermore, she had always been trying to forget her human identity.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and left, but he did not eat.

He did not like the smell of monkeys.

He climbed up the fruit tree and ate the golden fruits on the branches. He felt that the taste was not bad and that it was much better than the monkey brains.

The moonlight was like frost and the cold wind was still cold.

It seemed to be destined.

At the same time, many unimaginable things were quietly happening in the distant gathering place of humans.

In a city or hotel.

The guests surrounded the table, talking and laughing. They were looking excitedly at the young monkey whose head was tied to the middle of the table.

The monkey widened its eyes and was at a loss. It looked at the laughing men and women around it in a daze, not knowing what they were doing.

At this moment, a waiter walked into the room with a hammer and came to the table.

The men and women who were laughing immediately picked up the spoon in front of them and looked excitedly at the monkey trapped in the middle of the table.

"Bang\!"

A crisp sound\!

Before the monkey could react, the attendant with the hammer raised the hammer in his hand and knocked the monkey's head heavily.

The monkey widened its eyes but instantly lost its life.

The men and women sitting around it immediately got up and extended the spoon in their hands towards its broken head.

...

The sun was hot.

A pregnant yellow cow was plowing the ground exhaustedly. The whip behind it kept slapping its back, making a loud sound.

After three consecutive days of labor, it finally miscarried.

After the sky turned dark, it was chased into the cow pen. It stood in the darkness silently and chewed the dry and hard straw.

In the small yard a few meters away, a human was cutting the calf that had died before it was born.

The smell of blood filled the air and drifted into the circle of cows.

The old yellow cow heard the laughter of humans.

Soon, the calf was made into food and placed onto the table.

The family of five invited their family and friends. Under the dim light of the small courtyard, they chatted and laughed as they drank and ate meat.

...

The night was silent.

A black shadow climbed into the yard wall. Before it could approach the house, a loud dog bark suddenly came from the darkness beside it.

Then, a limping black dog rushed out of the darkness. As it roared, it approached the black shadow ferociously.

The lights in the house immediately lit up.

The black shadow immediately turned around, climbed up the wall of the yard, and fled.

The big black dog continued to roar. Only when its owner came out and did not discover anything did it quieten down.

In the darkness, the big black dog walked to a dark corner and lay down. He looked warily at the wall of the courtyard.

After dawn, the owner opened the door.

The big black dog did not have the time to eat before limping to the door of the neighboring family's courtyard.

A black and white female dog walked out the door.

The big black dog immediately wagged its tail and went forward.

After a while, the female dog's stomach grew.

No matter what happened, the big black dog would come and meet him at the first moment. He might even bring the bones over.

One night, the big black dog, who was sleeping in the yard, suddenly heard the miserable cries of the female dog next door. However, it quickly quietened down.

The big black dog paced around the courtyard anxiously. He did not sleep for the entire night.

After dawn, when the yard door opened, it rushed out immediately and rushed into the neighboring yard, but it did not see the figure.

Only the familiar smell was still lingering in the simple yard.

It was chased out.

It lay outside the yard and waited silently. However, it could not see the familiar figure again.

It limped between the two small courtyards every day and lay on the grass every day, waiting.

Until one night, he suddenly fainted.

When it opened its eyes, it realized that it was locked in a cage with its companions all around it. The ground beside it was covered in blood and fur, and fur was hanging on a wooden stake not far away.

The scream of a certain companion sounded in the hut beside him and quickly quietened down.

Before long, a bloody fur hung on the wooden stake.

At this moment, it seemed to understand something.

...

At the front of the village, there were only a few lonely trees left.

There were no trees, bushes, or even grass. There were cultivated fields everywhere.

Two birds built nests on one of the trees, laid eggs, and hatched small birds.

The female birds looked after the nest, the male birds looked for food, and the family was happy.

Every morning, the happy cries of birds could be heard from the tree.

Until one day, when the female bird was waiting for the male bird on a branch beside the nest, a stone suddenly flew up with a whoosh and hit its head.

The female bird's vision turned black and she fell from the tree.

In the nest, the still young birds chirped non-stop and called for their mothers.

Human laughter sounded from under the tree.

Soon, a few humans brought their tools and came under the few remaining trees.

Before long, the few trees fell shakily.

When the male birds returned with the food, the few trees had already disappeared. The female birds, their children, and the nest were nowhere to be seen.

The male bird bit the food and paced around the empty ground for a long time.

...

In another city.

The virus raged and a large number of humans died. The once bustling streets were filled with corpses.

At the same time, some red-eyed monsters appeared and ran amok in the ruins.

There were animals, insects, and humans. When they saw fresh life, they bit and killed cruelly.

Flames surged into the sky and there was blood everywhere\!

Heartless artillery started to bombard the city. Be it the red-eyed monsters or the humans who were not yet dead, they were buried in the ruins of the city.

They seemed to want to bury all sins.

However, more regions and more cities experienced changes.

Various viruses that humans had never discovered started to appear endlessly. All sorts of once docile and honest animals started to bite people crazily.

Some birds even started to attack humans from the sky.

The world was in chaos.
