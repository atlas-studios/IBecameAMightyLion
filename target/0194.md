Chapter 194: Test subject Lion King

"Roar\!"

The lion fell heavily to the ground and let out a miserable and desperate cry.

Blood sprayed and internal organs were all over the ground.

He only took one step across the border and could not stand up again.

His two companions and the female lions immediately stopped in their tracks and stopped in place. They looked at his opened stomach in extreme fear and the ferocious female cub, not daring to take another step forward\!

The blue-eyed lion immediately pounced on him, bit his neck, and gave him one last blow\!

After the lion stopped breathing, the blue-eyed lion raised its head and looked calmly at Catherine, as if it was saying, "Alright, you can kill me now."

At least, he did not die in the hands of his pride.

At least, before he died, he killed a traitor.

As a lion king, it was enough to die in the hands of his opponent.

Catherine flicked her sharp claws and was about to charge over when Chu Xiaoye suddenly turned around and walked to the side of the blue-eyed lion king, looking at the wounds on his body with a burning gaze.

His hind leg was limp and even the bones on his butt were exposed. His back was full of bite wounds and there were also wounds on his abdomen, face, and head.

He was seriously injured.

Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to survive.

However, what if he used his saliva to treat it?

From when he was young, his saliva could heal wounds and save many members of the pride of the cold father. Now, as he continued to evolve and become stronger, was his saliva also becoming stronger?

Coincidentally, there was a test subject in front of him.

If he could save this seriously injured lion king that was about to die, it would mean that his saliva had undergone an even greater change. In the future, it could even be used as a divine pill.

When fighting an enemy, he could completely change his method and attack with a more brave and fearless move, without needing to defend at all.

Even if he was injured, he had a strong self-healing ability and the magical effect of saliva\!

At the thought of this, he stopped Catherine from killing this blue-eyed lion king.

However, it was impossible for him to lick this lion king.

He turned around and looked coldly at the female lions and the two male lions in the opposite territory. Then, he turned around and walked towards the bushes.

He believed that even if he gave those fellows a few more guts, they would not dare to trespass his territory again\!

Catherine followed behind him silently.

The blue-eyed lion king was already preparing to close its eyes and wait for death. At this moment, it actually turned around and left. It was very confused.

Was this young king not preparing to kill him?

The two lions opposite him, who were only a fine line away, and the female lions stood in place, terrified. Even if they saw the two young lions leave, they did not dare to come and kill him.

The Chino brothers and the two female lions guarded the border, looking covetously at this prideful pride that had once been extremely strong and now was extremely miserable.

The lion's corpse was still lying there dripping with blood.

Do you dare to take a step forward?

Back then, when these two female lions full of scars were hungry, they had once sneaked into their territory to hunt and were almost killed by them.

They were very afraid of this super pride.

Now, they were no longer afraid.

Their king had given them extreme pride and confidence\!

Whoever dared to barge in would be killed without mercy\!

"Roar\!"

The Chino brothers also stuck out their chests for the first time and roared with dignity at the pride opposite them\!

The opposite pride immediately trembled in fear and retreated in panic.

The Chino brothers were even more pleased with themselves when they saw this scene. Just as they were about to continue roaring under the guise of a tiger, the two female lions slapped them twice and told them to continue patrolling the territory.

The Chino brothers were in high spirits. It was not easy for them to be so mighty, but they were actually slapped in front of the blue-eyed lion king by these two women. How could they tolerate this\!

They immediately bared their fangs and roared, their faces filled with ferociousness.

After roaring, they turned around and left to continue patrolling the territory.

A good man did not fight with females\!

One day, they would suppress these two women and teach them a lesson\!

Just wait and see\!

Chu Xiaoye returned to the bushes and took out a bloody bladder from the water buffalo's corpse. He soaked it in the waterhole for a while before filling it with water. He licked it back and forth with his tongue, circled it in his mouth, and spat it out again.

A few minutes later, he walked out of the bushes with water in his mouth and walked towards the blue-eyed lion king.

The blue-eyed lion king was already lying on the ground in despair. The wounds on its body made it clear that it would not live for long.

When he saw the young lion king walk back again, he thought that his death had arrived.

However, the other party did not kill him. Instead, he used the thing in his mouth to spray water on his wound, as if he was deliberately teasing him.

He felt extremely humiliated.

However, he did not resist.

Since he was about to die and the other party had helped him before, he should forget it.

This territory had once been his. There was no regret in dying here.

He slowly closed his eyes.

The sun on the distant grassland finally set.

Night fell.

Perhaps tonight, those carnivores that smelled blood would come and divide his body.

Chu Xiaoye left with the empty water bag.

Catherine hesitated for a moment and did not follow behind him. Instead, she walked into the grass not far away and lay down.

She knew that this lion king was still useful to him.

The current lion king could not die yet.

She had to watch over him.

The night wind was a little cold, bringing with it the salty and humid smell of the distant sea.

A crescent moon rose into the night sky.

Catherine lay in the grass and raised her head to look at the beautiful starry sky. Images of every night she had spent in the pride of the cold father following him secretly and watching him hunt and practice his skills appeared in her mind.

When Chu Xiaoye returned to the bushes and was about to peep at the various animals in the forest, he suddenly realized that the cute violent bear mother and son were confronting the leopard sisters.

This was an orchard.

Belia and the Belita viewed this place as their territory and did not allow other carnivores to come here to eat.

However, the cute violent bear and her son loved to eat this fruit and their tastes were almost the same as theirs.

They were all omnivores, were seldom picky about food and liked to eat almost everything. Therefore, the two sides became enemies.

The previous few times, it was just a small family quarrel and no major conflicts happened.

However, tonight, both sides looked very hot-tempered and did not retreat. They seemed to be preparing to fight.

As for the adult leopard couple, they squatted on the tree and did not intend to interfere.

Obviously, they wanted their daughters to be strong in battle. At least, they had to learn to protect themselves. They could not always rely on them.

Chu Xiaoye realized that the cute mother and son pair did not become tall. Instead, they grew round and looked even fatter.

As for the leopard sisters, not only did they grow taller, their four legs also became even more slender and tight. The curves of their bodies looked even more charming than before.

When Belia saw him appear, her fierce and overbearing expression immediately turned charming and gentle. The roar in her mouth also turned into the purring of a cat.
