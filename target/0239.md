Chapter 239: Battle at the Sea

"Boom\!"

On the distant sea, huge waves surged.

A huge black shadow suddenly jumped out of the sea. After stopping above the sea for a few seconds, it fell heavily into the water.

The black shadow was more than ten meters long and its entire body was covered in black scales. It had two rows of dense fangs in its mouth and looked even more ferocious than a shark\!

Then, more such giant black fish jumped out from the water.

In their mouths were sea pythons and giant strange fish.

The sea pythons and giant strange fish started to form groups and flee towards the shore in panic.

It turned out that the reason why many of these sea creatures invaded the land was that they were chased and killed by the stronger creatures in the sea.

After mutation, the strength of the various creatures in the sea also changed.

The sea was in chaos. Some tribes that could not survive in the sea could only seek other places. Hence, they treated the land as their destination.

Therefore, there was a war between land creatures and sea creatures.

At this moment.

When the sea pythons and giant strange fish species fled crazily towards the shore, the snow mountain team guarding the sea bared their fangs to resist their invasion.

Chu Xiaoye stood on the shore and looked up. In the snow mountain team, he saw crocodiles and seals and all sorts of strange mutated fish.

They had all undergone mutation and had become extremely ferocious.

Many sea pythons and giant strange fish started to flee towards those islands.

The land animals stationed on those islands rushed to the shallows to resist and kill the enemy bravely.

Chu Xiaoye saw the white pride, hyenas, rhinoceroses, even venomous bees, and all sorts of snow-white little animals. They followed behind and rushed up.

Facing the obstruction of the snow mountain team, the sea pythons and strange fish did not retreat and continued to sprint forward crazily.

The giant black fish behind them were too strong. There were even more powerful mutated species at the bottom of the sea that used them as food. They could not survive at the bottom of the sea.

In order to prevent their species from being extinct, they could only sprint towards the land with all their might.

Their bodies seemed to be more adapted to land.

"Boom\!"

Right at this moment, a huge wave suddenly rushed into the sky and smashed towards the island.

At the same time, a huge sea python nearly twenty meters long suddenly jumped out of the sea and landed on the shallows of the island, killing the animals on it crazily.

Under its lead, more sea pythons rushed up.

Chu Xiaoye clearly saw that two scales on the scales behind the giant sea python's head lit up.

"Roarâ€”"

An angry roar suddenly sounded\!

On the island, a huge white lion nearly two meters tall suddenly appeared and pounced at the huge sea python\!

There were also two crystal whiskers flickering on the corner of his mouth.

More white lions surged out from behind him and pounced at the sea pythons that were charging crazily towards the island.

Blood splashed and flesh flew everywhere\!

In a moment, the island and the sea were full of corpses.

The water around the island was almost dyed red with blood.

Finally, some sea pythons and strange fish broke through the obstruction and swam towards the shore quickly.

When they reached the shallow water covered in reefs, a loud cry suddenly came from the sky\!

Then, the densely packed snow eagles pounced down. Their ferocious claws pierced into the water and into the bodies of the sea pythons and strange fish. With a flap of their wings, they dragged them out of the water and flew into the sky. Then, they fell heavily onto the reef below.

Some snow eagles had just stuck their claws into the water when strange fish jumped out and bit their necks or wings, bringing them into the water.

Soon, the shallow water near the shore was also dyed red with blood.

On another island, for some reason, the snow mountain team guarding the sea around the island actually all died and sank to the bottom of the sea.

When the strange fish and sea pythons rushed over, they did not encounter any obstruction.

Hence, the densely packed sea python army and the strange fish species rushed over from the sea and swam towards the shore.

On the edge of the cliff at the very beginning of the island stood a huge and majestic white male tiger. Be it its aura or appearance, it was identical to the white male tiger that had rebelled in the forest previously.

His name was Locke and he was the brother of the white male tiger from before.

Behind him stood more than ten white male tigers, all looking at the sea python army and strange fish that had broken through the defense line and were charging towards the land with burning eyes.

From ancient times until now, their battle with the pride on this snow mountain had never stopped.

In the face of righteousness, they had always chosen to tolerate it.

Now, after the rain that accelerated the mutation of all creatures, they could not wait any longer.

This might be an opportunity.

Their tiger tribe would ascend to the throne of the snow mountain again\!

Their king should be the king of all beasts in this land\!

The sea around this island and the island turned into a smooth path. Countless sea pythons and strange fish started to sprint towards the land from here.

The snow mountain army of the other seas rushed over hurriedly, but it was already too late.

Thousands of sea pythons and strange fish broke through the defense of the island and came to the shallow water, surging crazily towards the shore.

Waves splashed and it was extremely chaotic\!

The heroic snow eagles were soon bitten by the terrifying army of sea pythons and strange fish.

The remaining snow eagles could only retreat in panic. As they circled in the sky, they cried out anxiously and angrily.

On the shore, other than Chu Xiaoye, the three of them, and the giant rhinoceros, there was also a group of wild dogs, a group of grassland lions, cheetahs, and other land animals.

However, there were only a few hundred of them.

Compared to the densely packed thousands of enemies in the sea, they seemed so small.

The teams on the other islands immediately returned to support, but they could only follow behind and chase with all their might.

The sea python army and the strange fish species had already rushed to the shore in a moment and crawled towards the shore.

"Whoosh\!"

Tilly was the first to charge forward. Her golden claws fluttered up and down as she let out an angry roar.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine rushed up and stood beside her.

The huge rhinoceros's hooves flew as it lowered its head and crazily used the horn on its forehead to fight.

The other animals also rushed up and stood on the shore, resisting with all their might.

None of them turned around to escape.

However, with their numbers, they could only guard this small coastline.

More sea pythons and strange fish rushed up from the coastline on both sides and started to run on the snow.

"Boom\!"

Right at this moment, the ground trembled like thunder\!

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw a black rhinoceros army and elephant herd running over from the distant land. They charged towards the sea python army and the strange fish species with a murderous aura.

Both sides started a bloody battle\!

"Whoosh\!"

On the shallows, a huge reef flew up and smashed towards the shore.

A group of wild dogs that were fighting the sea python were crushed to death on the spot.

Then, a huge sea python more than ten meters long suddenly jumped out from the water and pounced ashore like a bolt of lightning\!
