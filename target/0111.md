Chapter 111: The Laziness of the Pride

Fortunately.

That figure did not rush out.

Chu Xiaoye brought Maya and her children back to the pride's camp safely.

Although the female lions were all injured, they still got up warmly to welcome her and rubbed their heads and bodies affectionately with Maya.

The cold father lay in the grass not far away and only glanced indifferently, ignoring him.

The two young cubs were clearly a little nervous to see so many members. They actually crawled under Chu Xiaoye's legs and hid.

Little Curly Tail looked at the two young cubs excitedly and let out cries, as if he wanted to play with them. However, his two front legs were too injured and he could not move for the time being.

Mei Mei ran over and extended her claws, wanting to play with the two cubs. However, Chu Xiaoye opened them with his claws.

One of the reasons why Maya did not dare to bring the cubs back was that she was afraid that these fellows would mess around and not be careful.

The cubs were still very fragile now and could not withstand rough play.

The two cubs hid between his legs and bared their fangs at Mei Mei, looking fierce.

Mei Mei ran in front of Chu Xiaoye happily.

The new little lives brought life to the pride again.

Under normal circumstances, when the female lions returned with the cubs, they would have to meet the male lions in the pride to let the cubs' father recognize them through their scent.

However, the cold father was not in the mood now.

The cubs were still young, and Maya did not dare to bring them over.

After a long journey, although the two cubs were carried, they still had a hard time and were soon hungry.

Maya lay in the bushes and started breastfeeding.

The other lionesses dispersed and lay down in the grass to recuperate.

Although the jerky Mei Mei took down from the tree did not fill their stomachs, it finally eased their hunger.

With their current situation, they needed to recuperate in the camp for at least a week before going out to hunt again.

But.

Chu Xiaoye never would have thought that a week later, when their injuries had recovered, there would be no signs of them going out to hunt.

They always looked up at the storage room on the Baobab tree and waited anxiously.

The cold father's temper became more and more violent, and his gaze at him became colder and colder.

They were very hungry.

However, in order to let them recover as soon as possible, he had already given them food three times this week.

If they continued to eat like this, the food would be gone very quickly.

However, even his mother was looking at him with resentment and blame.

The other lionesses were very dissatisfied.

They seemed to think that since there was so much food on the tree, why not take it down for them to eat?

The weather was so hot and it was dangerous outside. They might not even be able to find prey when they went out to hunt. Why waste time and energy?

The pride had never had the habit of storing food, so they naturally could not understand this method.

Chu Xiaoye felt helpless and regretful.

This was indeed his fault.

His mistake was that he should not have let Mei Mei bring food for them from above.

He had broken the rules of the pride.

He made them lazy.

If a pride no longer had the heart to hunt and lost the courage to fight in a difficult environment, they would not be far from death.

Therefore, this time, no matter what, he would not compromise.

Even if it was Maya, who was nurturing her children, he would never give her any food unless he had no choice\!

The wounds on Little Curly Tail's legs were almost healed, but he had yet to recover his previous agility.

He could climb trees.

He had almost carried Chu Xiaoye to the tree to eat those prey.

But now, he was guarding under the tree with a fierce gaze, not letting anyone approach.

Without his brother's permission, he would bite whoever dared to take something from the tree without hesitation\!

Even if it was his father, he would never show mercy\!

His brother lost his claws because of him. Hence, in the future, he, Little Curly Tail, would be his brother's sharp claws\!

No one could dream of doing something that his brother did not let them do\!

Although Mei Mei was soft-hearted and did not want her mother and the other lionesses to starve, she was more determined to carry out Chu Xiaoye's orders than Little Curly Tail.

In the past, even when she was hungry, she never thought of going to the tree to eat those things.

Now, as long as her brother did not say anything, she would never climb the tree.

As for Catherine.

Needless to say.

She had absolute support for Chu Xiaoye\!

In her heart, everything he did was right, even if it was wrong.

Even his farts might be fragrant to her.

The cold father did not dare to teach his son a lesson because of her.

Every time the cold father lost his temper and growled at his son, she would quietly bare her fangs and raise her claws at the side.

At this moment, the cold father's temper always immediately stopped.

Of course, sometimes, when the cold father could not take this lying down, he would roar angrily a few times and look for the female lions to pick on them.

Without the support of her children and her tail completely broken, the lioness with a broken tail became the target he often vented his anger on.

The other lionesses kept quiet out of fear and did not dare to stop him.

As for the lioness with a broken tail, she could only tolerate it silently and always lay far away to hide.

Two more days passed.

The pride still did not go out to hunt. They still raised their heads and looked at the three storage rooms on the Baobab tree with covetous eyes.

They were hungry.

However, Chu Xiaoye still did not have any reaction.

Not only were they hungry, Chu Xiaoye, Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Catherine were also very hungry.

However, he would never compromise\!

How did they survive without him storing these prey? Didn't they rely on themselves to survive tenaciously?

He believed that hunger would make them forget their laziness and pull themselves together.

"Roar—"

But hunger made the cold father lose his temper first.

He roared at Chu Xiaoye, then at Little Curly Tail, who was guarding under the tree. Then, he looked angrily at Mei Mei.

However, they ignored him and did not even look at him.

The cold father immediately sensed that his dignity as a lion king was seriously injured and trampled. He immediately roared fiercely.

Catherine, who was lying in the bushes, stood up silently and looked at him coldly.

The cold father looked at her and immediately turned around. He bared his fangs and walked towards Aisha.

The two good sons she gave birth to\!

However, before he could enter, Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail had already walked to their mother's side and looked at him coldly.

The cold father turned around and walked towards Xi'er and Callie, who were lying together.

Xi'er immediately stood up and bared her fangs. Her remaining eye revealed a cold gaze.

She was not to be trifled with\!

The cold father stopped and looked at Maya.

Maya was feeding the two young cubs milk and looked at him calmly.

As long as he dared to approach her two children, she would definitely fight him to the death\!

A mother's anger could not be underestimated\!

"Roar—"

The cold father roared and walked towards the distant bushes.

The lioness with a broken tail lay there.

However, when she saw this angry king walking over and preparing to vent her anger on her, she did not immediately stand up and flee like she did in the past.

The cold father bared his fangs and came in front of her with a fierce expression. The roar in his mouth stopped\!

The lioness with a broken tail only had a bloody head left.

Her entire body disappeared\!
