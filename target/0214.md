Chapter 214: Golden Fur Lion King

"Roarâ€¦"

The lion king with mixed fur let out an angry growl and looked coldly at the two little things in front of it.

If not for the fact that he was injured now and if not for the fact that he had become a lone lion, he would have long rushed up and slapped these two little things who were biting off more than they could chew\!

He had expended a lot of energy fighting the hyena queen just now.

He did not want to waste his time and energy anymore.

The mission was important\!

He looked coldly at the two strong warthogs as if he was giving them one last chance to choose.

However, the two warthogs immediately lowered their heads and did not dare to look at him, nor did they have any intention of leaving with him.

Clearly, they were willing to follow the young lion.

The mixed fur lion king grinned and bared its two sharp fangs, but it did not stay any longer. It immediately turned around and left with the three baboons quickly.

Soon, they disappeared into the dense forest.

For the mission and for his merits, he abandoned his companions.

The three injured lions and the remaining lioness revealed a hint of sadness.

Chu Xiaoye picked up a leaf from the ground and held it in his mouth for a while. After chewing it, he walked to the female lion's side and spat the leaves with saliva on the wound on the female lion's hind leg.

After being slapped by him, the female lion was already lying obediently on the ground and did not dare to move.

Chu Xiaoye continued to use leaves and saliva to make medicine and smeared it on the lionesses' wounds bit by bit.

Soon, the wounds on the lionesses were smeared with green juice.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of the three lions again.

The three lions lay on the ground and watched him apply the wounds on the female lions. They knew that he had no ill intentions, so when he walked over, they were very quiet.

Chu Xiaoye observed their wounds. They were not fatal, but it would take at least three to four days for their wounds to recover.

They could not have stayed here for so long.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye continued to use his saliva and the juice of the leaves to heal them.

Catherine stood not far away and silently watched his busy figure. The strand of golden fur flickered charmingly in her eyes.

He would always be so fascinating to her.

Blue, the male leopard, did not know the young king's true intentions.

Was he pure and kind, or did he want to buy over the lion's heart and find a way to expand his pride?

It did not matter.

As long as he was strong, he would do anything.

Bru turned around, picked up the corpse of a sea python, and dragged it in front of the female lion.

No one knew if this lioness could survive tonight.

Even if he was going to die, he should eat something before dying.

The female lion looked at him gratefully and did not mind the flesh of the sea python. Her stomach was already rumbling with hunger, and she immediately lowered her head to eat.

However, soon, she was shocked to discover that her wound no longer hurt. Instead, a cool feeling surged into her body from the wound.

She ate with relish and soon ate the entire sea python.

Then, she felt extremely sleepy. Unknowingly, she closed her eyes and fell asleep.

When Chu Xiaoye applied the juice of leaves and saliva to the wounds on the three lions, Blue also dragged the corpses of the three sea pythons in front of the three lions.

The three lions raised their heads, looking dignified without being angry, but they also revealed grateful gazes at him.

After experiencing that mutation, animals now seemed to have more human emotions.

After eating, they quickly fell asleep.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up the tree at the side and prepared to rest for the night.

Catherine quietly climbed under the tree and guarded him and the lions he wanted to save.

Blue climbed up another tree to sleep.

As for the two warthogs, they dug two holes and crawled in.

Peace quickly returned to the forest.

The smell of blood from the sea pythons did not attract any animals.

Obviously, the army that searched the enemies of the sea had already frightened the original animals in the forest into hiding and trembling.

The night quietly passed.

When the first ray of sunlight pierced through the clouds and fell on the island, Catherine, who was lying under the tree, opened her eyes.

Everything was fine.

The golden morning sun shone through the gaps in the leaves and mottled the forest. Under the morning wind, they were like lively little elves dancing.

Above him, the figure was still sleeping.

Catherine stretched and stood up to look at the lioness.

Obviously, the female lion had already survived the most dangerous moment.

The two warthogs suddenly rushed out of the cave like two sharp arrows with a whoosh and ran into the distance\!

After they ran for a distance, they suddenly stopped in their tracks with confused expressions.

They froze in place for a moment before turning around and walking back.

This was their instinctive reaction after they woke up.

For warthogs, the grassland was full of enemies, and many despicable and cunning enemies liked to hide at their holes and attack them.

Therefore, every time they woke up from the hole and prepared to go out to hunt, they would suddenly rush out at lightning speed and make the enemies waiting outside unable to react.

Just now, they had clearly forgotten where they were and what they were doing. That was why they reacted in a daze and ran away.

Their actions woke up the three sleeping lions and the female lion.

The three lions looked at them and subconsciously stood up.

However, they soon reacted.

Then, they raised their legs to look and turned their heads to look at their bodies.

They suddenly realized that the wounds on their bodies had miraculously healed\!

Of course.

The female lion was even more shocked.

She realized that not only was she not dead, she was also very energetic. The pain from all the wounds on her body had disappeared.

She tried to get up from the ground and actually stood firm easily. She tried to walk another two steps and was very relaxed. She did not feel any pain on her hind legs at all\!

She turned her head in disbelief and looked at the wound on her hind leg.

Although the wound had yet to heal completely, it was already covered in scars. The bones that were revealed were already covered and many fresh muscles had grown\!

She raised her two hind legs respectively and was as relaxed as before she was injured\!

She tried to jump and ran a few more steps. She was light, agile, and relaxed. She did not look like she had been seriously injured.

One had to know that last night, she was already seriously injured, crippled, and on the verge of death. She could not stand up anymore and was already in despair, waiting for death\!

But nowâ€¦

It had only been a night\!

She suddenly turned around and looked at Catherine, who was under the tree. Then, she looked up at the figure on the tree.

At this moment, it was not just her. The three lions also raised their heads and looked at the figure on the tree.

The young king yawned and stretched under the morning sun. Then, he slowly stood up.

The golden fur on his neck swayed slightly in the morning breeze. The flickering light seemed to be even more dazzling than the fiery red morning sun.
