Chapter 455: Lion King vs Tiger

"Whoosh\!"

Facing the ferocious tiger's furious counterattack, Chu Xiaoye did not take it head-on. He immediately jumped up and jumped onto the tree above him. He quickly climbed in front of Molly and took the time to heal her.

The tiger with a broken tail missed and immediately roared angrily again, pouncing on Little Curly Tail at the side.

Seeing that his brother had left and that he was injured, Little Curly Tail did not dare to be stubborn. He immediately jumped up and landed on the tree above him. Then, he lowered his head and grinned and wagged his tail at the furious tiger under the tree, mocking and provoking it.

The tiger with a broken tail was furious and hateful. It slapped the tree trunk with its claws\!

The entire tree immediately trembled.

Chu Xiaoye, who was on the tree, helped Molly stabilize her body and continued to lick the terrifying wound.

Under his help, the blood from the wound quickly stopped. A layer of transparent mucus quickly sealed the wound like a thin membrane.

Molly recovered a little and looked at him gratefully.

"Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!"

The ferocious tiger under the tree continued to swing its huge claws and slap the tree.

Chu Xiaoye still did not panic and continued to treat Mei Mei and Little Curly Tail's wounds.

Catherine and Alisa had long followed, but at this moment, they did not take the risk to rush out. Instead, they hid in the bushes not far away and searched for an opportunity.

"Roar\!"

The other four ferocious tigers saw that the tree was about to fall from the slap and immediately reacted, joining the ranks of the slapping trees.

The five ferocious tigers slapped the tree trunk repeatedly. Although this tree was rather tough, it could not withstand such strength. The leaves on the canopy rustled and the tree trunk started to emit the sound of breaking.

When the five ferocious tigers saw this, they worked even harder and their roars became even louder.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at their ferocious attacks and still did not react. Instead, he turned to look at Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly.

Little Curly Tail and the other two immediately understood what he meant.

These five ferocious tigers were strong and could not fight head-on. They could only slowly exhaust their strength.

"Bang\!"

With another loud bang, the tree finally broke\!

As the tree slowly fell, the five ferocious tigers immediately bared their fangs and flicked their sharp claws. They raised their heads and looked up fiercely.

However, Chu Xiaoye and the other two jumped onto another big tree at the side.

The five ferocious tigers were stunned for a moment before they became even more furious. They immediately rushed over and continued to slap him.

The ferocious tiger with a broken tail was furious. It actually ignored everything and jumped up, landing on the tree trunk. It roared and quickly climbed up the tree.

Chu Xiaoye immediately brought Little Curly Tail and the others and climbed towards the highest tree trunk.

The tiger with a broken tail roared angrily and provoked him. It continued to climb up very quickly.

The other four ferocious tigers looked at each other and immediately jumped onto the tree trunk. They climbed up the tree one after another and prepared to support.

However, when the tiger with a broken tail climbed up, the tree immediately could not take the burden and started to bend down. Furthermore, it let out a painful groan, as if it could break at any time.

The four ferocious tigers were frightened and immediately stopped in the distance, not daring to climb up again.

The ferocious tiger with a broken tail also stopped in its tracks. Then, it swung its claws and started to slap the tree trunk on it.

Chu Xiaoye and the other two immediately started to sway violently with the tree trunk on it.

Molly, who was the most injured, almost could not hold on.

When the tiger with a broken tail saw this, it was overjoyed and immediately slapped even harder.

Seeing that the slender tree trunk was about to be broken by it, Chu Xiaoye suddenly let go of his claws and jumped down from the tree trunk. Like an arrow, he suddenly shot towards him with a whoosh\!

The tiger with a broken tail reacted quickly and immediately swung a claw to face the attack\!

However, it was already too late\!

"Pfftâ€”"

An explosion\!

A black smoke suddenly sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye and the speed at which it shot down instantly increased by a few times\!

Just as the tiger with a broken tail raised its claws, Chu Xiaoye had already passed it and flew down. Its speed was indescribable\!

"Whoosh\!"

Blood splashed\!

Before the tiger with a broken tail could react, it felt the raised claw suddenly turn cold. Then, its entire foot suddenly left its front limbs and flew out with blood splashing.

"Roar\!"

A miserable roar suddenly resounded throughout the entire forest\!

The four ferocious tigers crawling on the tree trunk below were shocked and furious. They climbed up again without care.

At this moment, Chu Xiaoye had already flown in front of them. Just as they raised their sharp claws and were about to take revenge for their brothers, a strong black smoke sprayed out from behind Chu Xiaoye again with a puff\!

As he fell, he suddenly turned around and flew out with a whoosh, landing on another big tree at the side.

At this moment, Alisa and Catherine suddenly rushed out of the bushes and rushed under the big tree that the five ferocious tigers had climbed up. They swung their sharp claws and started to quickly grab the lowest tree trunk\!

Chu Xiaoye immediately jumped down from the tree and joined the destruction tree\!

"Crack\!"

In the blink of an eye, the tree broke from the trunk and fell.

Little Curly Tail and the other two at the highest point of the tree flew out again and agilely landed on another big tree at the side.

The ferocious tiger at the highest point could only use its remaining three claws to grab the tree trunk tightly, letting out a terrified roar.

Its four brothers, who were always inseparable, had long forgotten about it. Seeing that the tree was about to fall, they could only hurriedly jump up and jump towards the tree at the side.

"Bam\!"

The tree fell\!

The ferocious tiger with a broken tail and palm at the highest point actually had its neck broken from the pressure and died\!

The remaining four ferocious tigers safely landed on the ground, but they were terrified. Seeing their brothers die tragically, their eyes were red. They calmed down and immediately roared, pouncing on Chu Xiaoye and the other two.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not escape again\!

"Whoosh\!"

He rushed up\!

He wanted to see how much his strength had increased.

Catherine was still like his shadow. She did not hesitate and followed closely without hesitation. There was almost no emotion in her dark eyes.

At this moment, she completely made herself become one with him, or a weapon.

Alisa looked at her and then at Chu Xiaoye. For some reason, she felt a little uncomfortable. However, she did not hesitate and immediately followed behind and rushed up.

As the future grassland queen and his soft rice queen, she was fearless and responsible\!

"Charge\! Gigolo\!"
