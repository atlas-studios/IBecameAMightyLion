Chapter 201: The Summoning of the Snow Mountain

The mission came.

As the youngest king of this grassland, Chu Xiaoye was the last to receive the notice.

Under the snow mountain at the upstream of the river, the sea creatures invaded again\!

Once those things broke through the barrier of the snow mountain, they would follow the river and invade the entire grassland majestically.

At that time, all the creatures on the grassland would be doomed.

Therefore, the animals on the grassland had the responsibility to stop the enemy and prevent them from breaking through the border of the snow mountain.

The snow mountains bordered the sea.

Due to the complicated terrain, the foot of the glacier extended into the depths of the sea. There were hidden reefs and islands everywhere, and it was easy to hide ashore. Therefore, almost all the sea creatures invaded from there.

At the end of the grassland here, although it was also bordered by the sea, it was filled with steep cliffs and only a river could pass through.

Because the crocodiles were stationed there all year round and looked down on the favorable terrain, they could see the ocean clearly. Therefore, very few sea creatures would sneak in from here.

Hence, the snow mountain became the most dangerous and most important barrier of the grassland.

The White Lions had been stationed there since ancient times to guard the grassland territory and stop the invasion of marine life.

Furthermore, they were huge and strong, so they naturally became the true kings of the grassland.

To them, the greater the ability, the greater the responsibility.

Their race had existed until now, and almost every generation's responsibility was to resist the enemies of the sea and protect this grassland.

The emperor guarded the country, and the king died protecting society.

Every generation of their kings and descendants would gradually grow old in battle with the sea creatures, die from injuries, or die in battle.

Therefore, the animals on the grassland were willing to listen to their call and fight side by side with them.

When the snow eagle brought news that Chu Xiaoye needed to go to the snow mountain to help defend against the enemy, Chu Xiaoye did not hesitate and immediately set off with Catherine.

As for the territory, he would leave it to the Chino brothers to guard.

This would also be the best opportunity to test the loyalty of the neighboring pride of blue-eyed lions.

Dark clouds covered the sky and thunder rumbled.

Before long, the rain poured.

The snow eagle flapped its wings and flew at a low altitude.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine braved the rain and jumped over the river, running towards the snow mountain.

To maintain their strength, they could not run too fast.

The snow eagle on his head did not urge him.

Only when the sky turned dark did they arrive at the high platform where hundreds of beasts had once gathered.

The dozens of majestic and powerful white lions back then gave Chu Xiaoye a huge impact and shock. He did not understand that there was actually such a king in this world that made herbivores and carnivores submit to him.

Now, it seemed that they could indeed be called the true kings of the grassland.

The true king was crowned not only because of his strength, but also because he could shoulder the great responsibility of protecting the grassland and protecting all the animals on the grassland to continue reproducing\!

The rain did not stop.

Mud splashed on the grass.

The snow eagle brought Chu Xiaoye and Catherine and continued traveling.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and looked at the female cub behind him. Seeing that she was following behind silently, he thought of how she had come to find him alone after trudging through the mountains and rivers. He thought of how she had helped him kill the enemy and stabilize his throne during this period of time, doing everything silently. At this moment, looking at her miserable appearance under the rain, he was a little moved.

Back then, he had secretly fed her food out of pity and saved her life. He did not expect that she would grow to become his most reliable assistant now.

It seemed that it was not all bad that he did not lose his humanity back then.

Some animals still knew how to be grateful.

"Roarâ€”"

Just as they were running in the rain, they suddenly heard a roar in front of them.

When Chu Xiaoye and Catherine ran close, they realized that a pride was attacking a male leopard.

The male leopard was weak and was baring its fangs, leaning against a rock and letting out a fierce and trembling roar.

Five tall lions surrounded him and teased him.

Chu Xiaoye recognized at a glance that this male leopard was the father of the female leopard. He also knew three of the five lions. It was the pride next door to them. They had trespassed his territory and been frightened away by the blue-eyed lion king.

He did not expect them to appear here.

Obviously, they were related to the summoning of the snow mountain.

There were no snow eagles above them. Clearly, they were already familiar with the path to the snow mountain and did not need to lead the way.

This also made the male leopard, who was traveling alone, encounter danger.

When Chu Xiaoye ran close with Catherine, the five lions immediately discovered them.

Three of the lions were stunned at first, then overjoyed.

The lion that was disfigured by Catherine immediately roared angrily and told his companions that these two bastards were the fellows who trespassed their territory and killed their lionesses\!

When enemies come face to face, their eyes blaze with hatred\!

The five lions immediately abandoned the male leopard and surrounded Chu Xiaoye and Catherine aggressively.

At this moment, not far away, an even taller and stronger lion walked over with a group of female lions.

The five lions immediately turned around and growled at the lion, as if they were saying something, their attitudes especially respectful.

Obviously, this strong lion with three scars on its face and its mane almost covering its entire body was their king.

Chu Xiaoye and Catherine had seen this scar-faced lion king before, but they had never fought it.

Back then, Catherine accidentally trespassed into their territory and was chased by them with their pride until they caught up to the bushes. They only left angrily because of the overflowing river water.

In the recent conflicts with them, this scar-faced lion king was not present. Clearly, it was patrolling elsewhere in the territory.

Now that they had encountered each other on the way to the snow mountain, both sides clearly did not expect it.

"Roarâ€”"

The lion that had been disfigured by Catherine immediately roared ferociously, hoping that his king could uphold justice for him and the dead lioness.

The scar-faced lion king walked out of the crowd and looked down at Chu Xiaoye and Catherine. Its mighty and strong body and peerless aura formed a sharp contrast to the five lions beside it.

"Whoosh\!"

Catherine took a step forward and walked to Chu Xiaoye's side, flicking her sharp claws.

The scar-faced lion king looked at her coldly. Just as he was about to give the order, the loud cry of the snow eagle suddenly came from above.

The scar-faced lion king was stunned. It raised its head and looked at the snow eagle. Then, it lowered its head to look at the two young lions in front of it, its eyes filled with confusion.

Obviously, he could not understand why the adults on the snow mountain would summon the two little fellows over. Furthermore, they actually let the Snow Eagle Messenger personally lead the way.

It seemed that these two daring little fellows still had some ability.

However, since they dared to trespass his territory, kill his lionesses, and hurt his subordinates, they had to pay the price\!

He was not a king that anyone could bully\!

Of course, now was not the time to take revenge.

The scar-faced lion king raised its head and looked at the snow eagle above it. Then, it turned around and left with the pride, as if nothing had happened.

When they reached the snow mountain, there would be plenty of chances to make these two little things disappear silently\!

Now, there was no need to bully the weak in front of the messenger.

This did not match his identity.
