Chapter 315: Battle of Life and Death Part 1

Haas died.

A lion king died just like that\!

Heroes appeared in chaotic times, and heroes faced heroes. The victor was king, and the loser was buried.

As a famous super lion king who had once commanded more than three hundred lions, even if he was defeated and died, he still had to give him the dignity he deserved.

Chu Xiaoye was not a narrow-minded lion.

He let Pit dig a pit on the hill by the river and buried this golden-haired lion king there, letting him have a good home with his back facing the grassland and facing the river.

However, in the animal world, there was no such thing as "home".

The loser never had dignity.

In the evening.

The corpse of this golden-haired lion king was dug out by a group of wild dogs. Even its bones were chewed and devoured.

As for his once majestic golden fur, it was snatched away by many small animals and birds to pave their caves or make a beautiful nest to attract the opposite sex.

The lush golden mane was played in the mouth of a jackal and flaunted everywhere.

After the sky turned dark, it rained again.

This time, the rain was dripping and continuous and lasted for nearly half a month.

The river water was high and the grassland was muddy.

The animals and plants were accumulating strength and waiting for the sky to clear.

Chu Xiaoye divided the seven hundred plus members into ten teams and made them live separately and hunt by themselves.

However, the herbivores on this grassland were still quickly exhausted.

Many herbivores saw that so many lions were gathered here and did not dare to stay. They quickly fled with their tribes.

The other carnivores also left in a hurry.

The grass grew lusher and lusher, but there were no pruners.

This group of lions had already started to quietly affect the ecological health of this grassland.

Chu Xiaoye knew that it was time to fight those black lions.

The day after the rain stopped, he brought the seven hundred plus members and set off majestically, advancing towards the grassland that he had previously left.

In less than two kilometers, they encountered the first wave of black lions.

However, this black lion tribe only had about 50 members and seemed to be the other party's vanguard.

When they saw the densely packed lions on Chu Xiaoye's side and could not see the end of the team, they did not even have the courage to roar. They turned around and fled in panic.

Ten kilometers later.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and instructed the teams to rest in place before looking for food.

The black lion's vanguard had already returned to report that the other party would gather over.

Therefore, they had to maintain their strength and fill their stomachs at all times and prepare to welcome the other party's army.

There was plenty of rain and lush grass on the grassland. There had been frequent battles recently, and many lions and carnivores had fled far away. Therefore, spring arrived for the herbivores.

They reproduced and grew crazily. Looking across, their prosperous tribes were everywhere.

They were extremely united now. Even if a small pride attacked, they dared to fight.

But now, what they encountered was not an ordinary pride.

Soon, the massacre started.

Group after group of herbivores fell on the grassland.

In order to save food, Chu Xiaoye brought the members of the pride of the cold father to the river and went into the water to hunt the giant crocodiles in the river.

The two giant crocodiles were enough for all the members of the pride of the cold father to eat their fill.

Although these giant crocodiles were not as fresh as the gazelles and zebras, they were still fresh meat. They could fill their stomachs and replenish their strength.

Chu Xiaoye could hold his breath for even longer in the water now.

With the smelly farts, he was faster and more agile in the water than fish. The huge crocodiles could not touch him at all underwater.

Tilly also went into the water and competed with him underwater.

The female cub was also very fast in the water, but she was still a little inferior to him now.

Soon, he and Tilly each killed a crocodile. Under the ferocious attacks of the other crocodiles, they easily dragged the giant crocodiles ashore.

These water overlords seemed to be furious and unwilling. They rushed up from the river and opened their mouths, wanting to take back their dignity.

However, before their bodies could climb up the shore, Little Curly Tail's tail slapped them, causing them to sway and fall back into the water.

Brother Flat Top, Little Mi, the badger, relied on the aura of lions and hissed arrogantly on the shore.

When everyone started to eat meat, it ran over and treated the crocodile's thick tail as a delicacy. It started to eat with relish.

Pit also came over and ate a few mouthfuls of fresh meat.

The warthogs were also omnivores. They would occasionally eat rotten meat and even kill the lone cubs of small carnivores like cheetahs and wild dogs to treat them as food.

However, the taste of a crocodile was really not to its liking.

Seeing that everyone was eating with relish and feeling bored, Pit walked to the river and lowered its head to drink water. It deliberately let out cries to provoke the giant crocodiles in the water.

The warthogs were extremely resistant to droughts. Even if they did not drink water for a few months, they could live well.

Now, it only saw that the team was strong and majestic, causing all the animals to tremble in fear and flee. Hence, it was in high spirits, extremely excited and pleased. With its backer beside it, it became bold and arrogant.

After all, he had peed his pants in fear when he saw these underwater killers before. Now that he had gained power, he naturally had to show off.

However, those underwater giant crocodiles did not give face to him because he had backers beside him.

"Whoosh\!"

Water splashed everywhere\!

A huge crocodile suddenly jumped out of the water, opened its bloody mouth full of fangs, and bit its head\!

Pit was shocked. Before it could react, its entire head was sucked in by the bloody mouth\!

Its vision immediately turned black\!

"My life is over\!"

At this moment, Pit was shocked, regretful, and filled with despair.

However, the two rows of sharp fangs did not immediately close and bite its head to pieces. Instead, they started to gradually separate out.

"Bam\!"

Blood splashed everywhere\!

The bloody mouth was actually broken into two\!

"Whoosh\!"

The crocodile, who had lost its mouth, fell into the water with a bang and rolled violently.

Then, they were mercilessly eaten by the other giant crocodiles that had rushed over.

The river water instantly turned scarlet.

Pit survived the calamity and stood by the river in a daze. For a moment, it actually felt like it had fallen into a dream and was in a daze, unable to react.

"Bang\!"

Chu Xiaoye kicked it to the back and flicked his claws, throwing the crocodile's bloody jaw into the water.

It seemed that he was even stronger now.

These giant crocodiles that he had once been shocked by seemed so fragile in front of him.

"Roar\! Roar\! Roar\!"

Little Curly Tail swayed his butt obsequiously and came to his side, his face filled with admiration.

"Brother is so powerful\! Brother is so powerful\!"

Mei Mei rolled her eyes at him in disdain. "Bootlicker\!"

Then, she ran behind her brother and roared.

"Brother is so powerful\! Brother is so powerful\!"

After eating and drinking their fill, they gathered the team and continued to set off.

The sun set and night fell.

Five kilometers away.

The green grassland was suddenly submerged in a huge black color.

"Roarâ€”"

The black lions roared like thunder, shaking the grassland and emitting a murderous aura.

More black lions gathered from all over the grassland.

This was a battle that determined the survival of both sides\!
