Chapter 383: Untitled

In the bushes.

The members of the pride lay in the grass and narrowed their eyes. They looked at the grass that buried their prey not far away in unison, still feeling unwilling and puzzled.

Then, why did he bury the prey?

Chu Xiaoye did not explain anything.

Of course, he could not explain anything in this situation.

The little girl sat on the tree, hugging a branch and bathing in the golden setting sun. She swayed her legs wrapped in tight leather pants and hummed a song softly, as if she was not affected by the atmosphere of the pride.

In her eyes, this young king was smarter than all the members of the pride combined.

Since he had decided to bury those water buffaloes, he naturally had his reasons.

Perhaps the water beef was not delicious, or the water buffalo was about to spoil, or perhaps there was too much meat and they were afraid that the pride would suffocate.

Anyway, he would not waste food for no reason.

Just like her beef slices. She originally thought that they were gone. Unexpectedly, he actually hid them on the top of the tree and added many delicious spices.

A lion knew how to build a hut, make clothes, and marinate delicious beef. This intelligent behavior was not something these fellows could understand.

Although she did not understand, she would choose to believe and trust unconditionally.

"King, ignore them. Come and eat eggs."

The little girl took out the bird egg from her pocket again.

She felt that this was a very nutritious food and had to share it with this king.

Chu Xiaoye stood on a branch at the side, as if he did not hear anything. He did not move and still narrowed his eyes, looking at the distant grassland.

The sun fell to the horizon.

A group of black dots suddenly appeared in the sky. Soon, the black dots came close and let out noisy cries.

They were a group of hungry vultures.

More than ten vultures stopped in the sky where the water buffaloes were buried and started to circle and cry. Their cries were filled with anxiety, as if they were urging something.

Soon, a few jackals appeared on the distant horizon.

Then, another group of spotted hyenas appeared.

Then, two more wandering lions appeared.

Under the guidance of the vultures in the sky, the carnivores on the ground came after hearing the news.

Although the vultures were the first to discover the prey, they could not dig up the soil and eat the prey inside with their strength alone.

Therefore, they summoned help and moved together.

Many carnivores on the grassland actually followed vultures. Most of the time, the vultures in the sky would follow the carnivores on the ground to find the rotten meat hiding in the grass.

The two were competitors, but they always borrowed each other's strength.

The circling of the vultures attracted the dissatisfaction of the members of the pride of the cold father.

Little Curly Tail stood up from the grass, wagged his tail, and looked up at the vultures in the sky with ill intentions.

If those fellows dared to come down, he did not mind using his tail to let them know whose territory this was\!

On the grassland, the first to arrive was the agile jackal.

However, the smell of the hyenas made them retreat and not dare to approach the place where they buried their prey for the time being.

A group of more than twenty spotted hyenas ran over excitedly. At the border of the pride's territory, they specifically stopped and smelled the scent left behind by the lion on the ground, feeling a little hesitant.

If the smell was fresh, it meant that the lion had just left or was nearby. He had to be careful.

If the smell was too faint or had already disappeared, it meant that the lion had not come for a long time. It should be safer here.

Coincidentally, the smell left behind by the Chino brothers was about to dissipate.

The hyenas cried out to each other and discussed for a while. They did not hesitate and immediately crossed the border of the territory and entered the territory of the pride, running towards the grass that hid the water buffaloes.

The smell of blood did not completely dissipate. To hyenas, the smell there was already very strong.

The hyenas were very excited and puzzled.

Which idiot would bury their prey in the ground?

It was definitely not a lion. Lions were definitely not that stupid.

The hyenas circled the grass a few times and immediately started to dig the ground with their claws.

A few hyenas guarded the surroundings to prevent the pride from suddenly arriving.

In the bushes, Little Curly Tail was very angry. The cold father also stood up and bared his fangs. The other members of the pride stood up and prepared to charge over.

They would never allow this group of despicable people to enjoy their prey\!

However, Chu Xiaoye, who was squatting on the tree, was very quiet. He only looked calmly at the noisy place and did not express anything.

The members of the pride were puzzled again and even furious.

This was their prey\!

It was fine that they did not enjoy it, but now, they had to watch helplessly as this group of enemies enjoyed it. What was their king thinking?

Mei Mei could not help but climb up the tree and come to her brother's side. She rubbed her head against his neck and looked at him anxiously.

Everyone was very depressed.

Chu Xiaoye turned to look at her and raised his claws.

Little Curly Tail, who was under the tree, was delighted when he saw this scene. He grinned and thought to himself, Finally, Brother is going to beat Mei Mei up\! Heheheheâ€¦

In the end, Chu Xiaoye only raised his claws and rubbed Mei Mei's head gently, telling her to calm down.

Mei Mei immediately narrowed her eyes and quietened down.

Chu Xiaoye looked at the grassland with a burning gaze, feeling a little conflicted. He hoped that something would happen, but he did not want anything to happen.

At this moment, the two wandering lions also rushed over from afar.

However, when they walked to the border of the territory, they stopped, their gazes grave and hesitant.

They were even more careful than the spotted hyenas. If they stepped into this territory, it was equivalent to provoking the lion king of this territory. Either they died, or they lived.

They raised their eyes and looked at the group of busy hyenas not far away.

Anyway, the prey had yet to come out. They would wait and see for the time being. If the pride of this territory did not rush over, they had plenty of chances.

The few jackals also stood not far away obediently and watched, waiting for the hyenas to take the lead.

Under normal circumstances, lions would not kill jackals. In fact, after eating their fill, they would even turn a blind eye to jackals stealing food. After all, jackals were small in size and had a small appetite. They were not dangerous to lions and could not even be considered competitors.

The hyenas were very fast.

Grass flew and soil flew. The pit that buried the few water buffaloes was quickly dug out again.

The butt of a water buffalo was revealed.

The few spotted hyenas immediately rushed up and bit different parts. They wanted to drag the water buffalo out, but they realized that this water buffalo was too heavy and did not move.

Under the hyena queen's cries, the hyenas dug the ground with all their might again.

Soon, the water buffalo revealed its entire body.

In order to prevent the pride from suddenly coming, the hyenas had to eat quickly and bite and swallow. They could not delay at all.

The hyena queen was naturally the first to eat. She walked behind the water buffalo and bit off the water buffalo's male food. She walked to the side and wolfed down the food.

The other hyenas immediately started to bite and eat according to their tribe status.

Not far away, the jackals waited patiently.

As for the two lions, they were still standing at the border, drooling and hesitating.

As lions, they naturally knew how serious it was to invade the territory of other lions.

More than twenty spotted hyenas were chowing down excitedly.

In the bushes, Chu Xiaoye's pride was watching with flames shooting out of their eyes. They wanted to rush out and bite the despicable thieves to death\!

The cold father could not help but let out an angry growl.

The two lions that were wandering at the border were terrified when they heard this roar. They hurriedly turned around and ran a few steps before looking back with fear.

The hyenas that were excitedly snatching food were also shocked. However, they could not bear to leave. When they looked up and confirmed that no lion had come close, they lowered their heads and started eating again.

The cold father turned around and looked up at Chu Xiaoye on the tree. He glared at him, as if he was saying, "Unfilial son\! What are you doing?"

Chu Xiaoye looked at the hyenas that were eating with flickering eyes and ignored them, treating him as air.

The cold father was furious. He immediately bared his fangs and growled at him, as if he was reprimanding him for his negligence and being the king of the pride in vain\!

Chu Xiaoye still ignored him.

The cold father panted heavily and suddenly turned around. He growled at the other members beside him, as if he was saying, "Who dares to follow me\! Let's go out and chase away that group of despicable bastards\! That's our prey\!"

However, no one bothered with him.

Even Aisha, Xi'er, Maya, and Callie pretended not to hear him. They even deliberately closed their eyes and pretended to sleep.

In this pride, they only acknowledged one king and listened to his orders.

Although they did not understand their king very well regarding today's matter.

The cold father was furious. He decided to go out alone and fight alone\!

He was in his prime and still strong. He would never allow this group of despicable enemies to be so fearless in front of him\!

His eyes spewed flames. He secretly decided to let the unfilial son on the tree and the fellows beside him take a good look. His cold father was still mighty and brave\!

"Roarâ€”"

The cold father roared and his blood boiled. He prepared to charge out.

At this moment, a familiar figure suddenly walked out from the side and blocked his path, looking at him coldly.

The surging blood in his heart instantly cooled down. His mighty and fierce aura also instantly disappeared.

The cold father narrowed his eyes and looked outside the bushes. He quietly lay in place, his stomach trembling uncontrollably.

Catherine turned around and looked outside too.

Unfilial son\!

The cold father cursed in his heart.

Although that unfilial son did not do anything, this female cub definitely meant that unfilial son.

The cold father's roar frightened the hyenas outside, but they did not see the lion rush out of the bushes for a long time. They immediately became bold.

They quickly divided the strong water buffalo and started to dig a second one.

The two lions not far away finally could not help it.

It seemed that the lion kings of this territory were cowards. They only dared to hide in the forest and roar, but they did not dare to come out. If they had known earlier, they should have long come out to snatch food.

At the same time, they immediately coveted this territory.

Since the lion king was so useless, as long as they defeated the other party or scared it away, this territory and the female lions here would belong to them\!

Just as the two lions were having a beautiful dream and were about to step into the territory, a change suddenly happened in the hyenas\!

For some reason, the hyena queen, who ate first, suddenly threw a female hyena beside her to the ground and bit the other party's throat\!

The female hyena lay on the ground with her eyes wide open, terrified and confused.

The other hyenas beside him were also shocked by this sudden scene.

In the bushes, Chu Xiaoye, who was squatting on the Baobab tree, suddenly stood up and looked at the hyena queen with a burning gaze.

"Ow Ow\! Ow Ow\!"

The hyenas that were digging also cried out in fear as they ran.

However, after running for a while, one of the seemingly normal hyenas suddenly turned around and bit the neck of another hyena at the side.

The hyena was caught off guard and fell limp to the ground. It widened its eyes, not knowing what was happening.

Suddenly, another hyena jumped up and bit the neck of a companion.

Without exception, the eyes of these spotted hyenas that had suddenly killed their companions turned terrifying scarlet\!

For a moment, the hyenas were in chaos and running everywhere.

However, in a moment, almost all the hyenas started to bite each other, as if they had lost their minds. Not only did they bite, they also tore the flesh and fur of their companions\!

The two lions that were about to step into the territory froze in place in fear when they saw this scene, not daring to take another step forward.

In the bushes, the cold father had already stood up and looked at the scene outside in shock.

The other members of the pride could not help but take a few steps forward. They widened their eyes and looked at the bloody scene in shock and confusion.

What was wrong with these hyenas? Why were they suddenly killing each other?

After biting the corpse of its companion into pieces, the strong hyena queen was about to pounce on her other companion when her body suddenly stiffened. Her entire body trembled a few times, and then she rolled her eyes and fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth and crying out\!

The other hyenas that were biting crazily also fell to the ground one after another. Their bodies were stiff and they died inexplicably\!

In the blink of an eye, the twenty-over hyenas that had just eaten heartily and were extremely excited fell to the ground and died\!

Some were bitten to death by their companions, and some suddenly died for no reason\!

The noisy grassland instantly quietened down and became strangely silent.

In the pit, the outline of the second water buffalo had already been revealed. However, the jackal and the two lions not far away watched in fear, not daring to go forward.

Even the vultures circling in the sky flew higher in fear.

In the bushes, the members of the pride suddenly seemed to understand something.

The cold father stiffly turned his neck and looked at the "unfilial son" on the tree.

Chu Xiaoye's expression was also very ugly.

Although he was right, he did not want to see this outcome.

In the distance, the sun set.

Darkness came again.
