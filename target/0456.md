Chapter 456: Untitled

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye shot out\!

Just as they were about to encounter the four ferocious tigers, the four ferocious tigers immediately raised their upper bodies and stood up. They swung their huge and sharp claws and let out a loud and terrifying roar\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly jumped up and flew over the head of one of the ferocious tigers. Just as the ferocious tiger's raised upper body started to land, he suddenly lowered his head and spat out black airflow behind him. Then, he shot down like a rocket and suddenly turned around, shooting behind the ferocious tiger\!

Its speed was peerlessly fast\!

The ferocious tiger did not have the time to react and its raised upper body fell to the ground. Chu Xiaoye's sharp golden claws had already pierced through the fur on its back and pierced into its spine\!

"Crack\!"

His entire spine was instantly cut into two\!

The sharp golden claw was like a broken bamboo as it went down and instantly broke through his entire body\!

"Roar\!"

A miserable roar immediately sounded\!

Just as this ferocious tiger was about to turn around and bite with all its might, its body suddenly turned limp and it fell to the ground. It turned around and saw that the back half of its body had almost left its body and its internal organs were already flowing to the ground\!

It stared at the tiger with eyes filled with despair. It wanted to roar, but it no longer had the strength.

The other three ferocious tigers were shocked when they saw this scene, but they did not have the time to care about their backs because in front of them, Catherine and Alisa had already pounced like lightning\!

These three ferocious tigers, who had always been brave and fearless, suddenly felt their courage shatter. They did not dare to fight and hurriedly jumped to the side, preparing to escape.

Two of the five brothers had already died. If they did not escape, it would be too late to regret\!

However, they seemed to have underestimated the speed and strength of these two young female lions. They could not imagine the subtle thought of killing them at this moment\!

"The king can kill and so can I\! Otherwise, I'm not worthy of following the king\!"

"Hmph\! I, Alisa, am the daughter of the heavens. I will never be weaker than any lion in my life\! I will never lose to this loser who once begged me for mercy underwater\!"

Catherine and Alisa immediately pounced behind the two ferocious tigers, swung their claws, and started their respective performances\!

Unfortunately, Chu Xiaoye did not have the time to care about them.

Another ferocious tiger ran to the left. As it ran, it roared, as if it was asking for help.

Chu Xiaoye was secretly shocked. He did not dare to hesitate and immediately chased after her.

It was already unbelievable and terrifying that the five tigers were gathered together. How could there be other helpers? If there were really other helpers, their helpers might be even stronger than theirs.

"Whoosh\!"

Chu Xiaoye increased his speed and chased after her. He soon caught up to her. Just as he was about to jump up, a deafening roar suddenly sounded from the grassland in front of him\!

Although this roar was not as powerful as his Lion King Roar, it carried a terrifying aura that made him instinctively tremble in fear\!

His heart immediately shrank and his entire body trembled, almost falling.

The ferocious tiger he was chasing in front was even more unbearable. After hearing this terrifying roar, its body suddenly turned limp and it fell to the ground with a bang. It rolled a few times on the ground before stopping.

Chu Xiaoye stopped and looked over.

On the dark grassland, a huge and strong figure about two meters tall gradually revealed its outline under the dim moonlight.

It was a larger tiger\!

No\!

Chu Xiaoye's eyes flickered with golden light and his heart skipped a beat. He looked at the terrifying figure in disbelief. The thick and sharp fangs that grew out of the corners of his mouth like ivory made the already terrifying figure look even more ferocious and terrifying\!

It was not an ordinary tiger, but the legendary super predator that had long been extinct—the saber-toothed tiger\!

It was a saber-toothed tiger\!

At this moment, facing this ancient ferocious beast, be it a tiger or a lion like him, they all felt instinctive fear and trembling. This was a bloodline suppression\!

The tiger lying on the ground finally stood up shakily and let out a hoarse and terrified growl, as if it was reporting something to the terrifying super killer.

It turned out that these five ferocious tigers were not the masters of this territory. The true master here was this saber-toothed tiger\!

The saber-toothed tiger seemed to be very confident in its roar and strong aura. After seeing Chu Xiaoye, it did not run over in anger. Instead, like a king, it looked down on the world and slowly stomped its feet as it walked over.

In its opinion, this weak lion should be like those ferocious tigers. When it saw it, it would immediately be terrified and stay in place, trembling and without strength.

Hearing the tiger's report, the saber-toothed tiger's expression changed slightly.

When it used a new gaze to reevaluate the young lion in front of it, it suddenly realized that this young lion had suddenly started to escape.

Chu Xiaoye ran in another direction.

Not far behind him, Catherine and Alisa had already defeated the other two ferocious tigers. Little Curly Tail, Mei Mei, and Molly ran over. They looked flustered, as if they wanted to help him.

Chu Xiaoye knew clearly that in front of this powerful ancient ferocious beast, the more people who came, the more they would die. Furthermore, Little Curly Tail and the other two were injured. If they were chased by this saber-toothed tiger, they would definitely die. Therefore, he decided to lure this saber-toothed tiger away alone and circle around it slowly.

"Roar—"

He turned around and roared at Little Curly Tail and the others, telling them to leave quickly. Then, he bared his fangs provocatively at the saber-toothed tiger.

Little Curly Tail was stunned for a moment before he stopped.

Mei Mei did not hesitate and immediately fled in another direction with Molly. She even turned around and roared angrily, urging Little Curly Tail.

Ever since she was young, her brother had never disappointed her. She believed that her brother could definitely deal with this big tiger. She knew that the three of them had already become her brother's burden. If they did not escape, her brother would be implicated.

Little Curly Tail naturally understood this, but he was still unwilling to leave.

Only when he saw Catherine and Alisa kill the two ferocious tigers and chase after his brother without hesitation did he feel a little relieved. He immediately turned around and followed behind Mei Mei and Molly.

Now, he had to protect Mei Mei and Molly. He had to send them home safely. It was enough to have Catherine by his brother's side. Now, with the addition of the powerful lioness cub, there should be no problem, right?

Little Curly Tail looked back at the terrifying big tiger and secretly cheered for his brother.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and clearly saw that three crystal whiskers had lit up at the corner of the saber-toothed tiger's mouth\!
