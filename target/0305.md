Chapter 305: Evolution

At some point in time.

Catherine, Tilly, and Mei Mei, who were behind Chu Xiaoye, had disappeared.

Haas‘ angry roar made the pride behind him surge up again and stand beside him. They bared their fangs and prepared to charge at any time.

But.

After roaring, this young golden-haired lion king quickly calmed down.

Faced with the death of his guard and his humiliation, he actually chose to tolerate it. He only looked at Chu Xiaoye coldly and turned around.

“This will never end tonight\!”

He left behind a figure that would definitely take revenge and retreated with the pride. He did not even look at the lion's corpse again.

Chu Xiaoye could not help but admire this golden-haired lion king even more.

Only those who could bow and submit could achieve greatness.

Unfortunately, he could not do it.

"Roar—"

Before the young lion king could walk far, a few miserable and terrified cries suddenly came from the pride behind Chu Xiaoye.

Then, a few female lions and lions fell into a pool of blood, their eyes wide in disbelief.

Catherine put away her silver claws.

Tilly raised her golden claws proudly and mimicked Chu Xiaoye's actions just now. She slowly wiped the mane of the lion she killed.

The other members around him were flustered and confused.

Opposite him, Chu Xiaoye clearly saw the bitterness and hatred in the golden-haired lion king's eyes when it turned around.

Chu Xiaoye knew that this was not the end.

However, it was not easy to find them all.

He could only continue to provoke this golden-haired lion king and expose flaws in him and his spies.

Unfortunately, the other party did not give him any chance and left quickly.

Chu Xiaoye looked at his back and thought for a moment. He did not continue to kill indiscriminately. He called back Catherine and the others and instructed Lars, One-eyed, and the others to pay attention to the new members who had joined recently.

The gathered team quickly went up again.

Chu Xiaoye came to Molly's side and saw her lying on the ground motionless. She was looking blankly at the lion's bloody head beside her.

Mei Mei walked over and used her head to touch her body, her face filled with sadness.

Little Curly Tail stood at the side with a complicated gaze and looked elsewhere.

The other members of the pride of the cold father mourned silently.

The female cub's neck had already been pierced by the lion's teeth. At this moment, she was lying on the ground motionless. Clearly, she could not survive.

Even she seemed to feel that she did not have much time left and could not be bothered to blink.

However, Chu Xiaoye suddenly walked up and kicked her butt.

Under everyone's stunned gazes, the seemingly dying Molly suddenly struggled to get up. Then, she twisted her neck and walked a few steps, as if she was completely fine\!

Molly stood in place in a daze, seemingly unable to react.

Chu Xiaoye walked close and looked at the wound on her neck. Although it had yet to heal completely, it had miraculously formed a scar.

The female cub had already escaped from the death god\!

Obviously, his treatment effect was even stronger.

When Xi'er, who only had one eye left, saw this scene, she seemed to remember how he had saved her life when she was covered in wounds and about to die.

She came in front of Chu Xiaoye and stuck out her tongue gratefully and gently to lick the golden fur on his neck.

She had already treated this young lion king as the true king of the pride of the cold father.

Callie, Maya, and Aisha also walked over and helped him tidy his fur affectionately.

The cold father stood not far away and watched this scene silently. He was not angry at all, and his eyes only revealed a complicated light.

Indeed, he was old.

If the pride wanted to reproduce, they naturally had to change generations, and each generation had to be stronger than the previous.

Although he did not like this unfilial son, what he had done during this period of time still satisfied and pleased him.

His dominance and decisiveness towards the golden-haired lion king just now made him even more proud.

His son was not a coward\!

Molly froze in place for a while before waking up. She walked in front of Chu Xiaoye and lowered her head. Just as she was about to crawl on the ground to express her gratitude and loyalty, Chu Xiaoye had already turned around and left.

The female lions' intimate actions made him feel very uncomfortable.

Furthermore, he suddenly felt a pain in his stomach, as if there was gas that wanted to rush out.

But it was definitely not a fart.

He had to find a quiet place to relieve himself as soon as possible.

Could those wild fruits he had eaten given him a stomachache?

He quickly walked into the bushes and into the depths of the forest.

Although he really wanted to run and poop, for the sake of the lion king's image, he could only tolerate it.

He passed through the orchard and came to a dense patch of bushes.

Due to the rain of blood, the bushes here were lush and extended everywhere. Some were lying on the ground, some were crawling on trees, and some were piled up, winding up and growing, forming spherical bushes with a lot of space inside.

Chu Xiaoye casually crawled into a bush and quickly dug the ground with his claws.

Just as he was digging excitedly, a snow-white figure suddenly crawled in. It raised its claws and started digging with him, its furry body leaning tightly against him.

Chu Xiaoye froze and looked at the female cub in shock.

Tilly turned her head, grinned, and looked at him shyly like a human little girl.

"Let me help you."

Chu Xiaoye felt a pain in his stomach that was a little unbearable. It was not as painful as an ordinary stomach ache, but more like he was poisoned.

Blood flowed throughout his body and his body was hot. He felt that the airflow was accumulating and expanding, as if it would spray out like a flood at any time.

He could not help it\!

"Bang\!"

He slapped down and sent the female cub flying.

However, just as he was squatting in the pit, Tilly walked in again and squatted in front of him. She raised her head and looked at him seriously with her light blue eyes. Her face almost touched his.

They could feel the heat from each other's breaths.

The hot air Chu Xiaoye exhaled sprayed on her face and was sucked in by her, causing her gaze to brighten. Her head leaned forward and was almost stuck to his face.

Chu Xiaoye was embarrassed, anxious, and angry, but he no longer had the strength to care about her.

"Bang—"

With a loud bang, black fog rolled\!

The entire bush was instantly submerged in this black smoke.

"Whoosh\!"

Two golden lights suddenly bloomed in Chu Xiaoye's eyes like stars that lit up the night\!

Tilly suddenly opened her mouth and spat out a white breath. A tempting fragrance instantly filled the entire bush and did not dissipate for a long time.

At the same time.

Chu Xiaoye suddenly felt a hot face pressed against his face.

Mouth to mouth, nose to nose, eyes to eyes.

His heart skipped a beat.
