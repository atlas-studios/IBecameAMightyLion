Chapter 117: Two Unfilial Sons

Three days later.

The trap was finally ready.

The bottom of the pit was filled with sharp branches.

On the top each of the four branches, there was a fang of Seno that was extremely sharp.

Chu Xiaoye even stuck the arrow that was pulled out of his hind leg in reverse.

To make it more hidden, they first placed some soft and slender branches on it, then sprinkled it with leaves, and then sprinkled a thin layer of soil on the leaves. Finally, they went elsewhere to gather grass and spread a lot of grass on it, making it look no different from the previous grass.

With the tiger's weight, as long as its front limbs stepped on it, it would definitely fall instantly.

To prevent his pride from accidentally falling into the trap, Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei take turns to guard there.

On this night.

The female lions prepared to go out to hunt again.

The cold father naturally had to follow.

After the warthog finished setting up the trap, it was not killed by Chu Xiaoye. Instead, he let it continue to dig holes in the camp.

The hole it dug this time could not be too big, but it had to be deep. Furthermore, it had to dig beside Maya.

In this way, when danger arrived, the two young cubs could immediately hide in the hole to avoid it.

The warthog trembled as it dug the hole in front of Maya. Chu Xiaoye personally supervised from the side, afraid that Maya would not be able to resist biting its neck.

The two little cubs, Qiqi and Nunu, were initially very afraid of this warthog with two big fangs. However, soon, they were not afraid.

Because this fierce-looking fellow seemed to be more afraid than them.

The two little fellows first played by Chu Xiaoye's legs and then tried to play with this warthog.

However, Chu Xiaoye used his claws to move hem back.

Although warthogs were the prey of lions, this fellow's fangs were not to be trifled with. Many inexperienced young lions and leopards might even be pierced to death by them when catching them.

Although this warthog looked very obedient, Chu Xiaoye did not dare to let the two cubs play with it.

Maya lay at the side and watched, nervous and drooling.

She wanted to eat this pig.

However, clearly, she could not defeat this kid in front of her.

She knew how terrifying this kid was.

However, she could not understand why this kid wanted to rear a prey and even took the initiative to feed it. It completely subverted her worldview.

Late at night.

Chu Xiaoye let Little Curly Tail bring the warthog up the Baobab tree. Then, the four of them lay in ambush in the bushes at the back, waiting for the terrifying enemy to appear.

Everything was ready except for the enemy's attack\!

If he did not kill this enemy completely, Chu Xiaoye could not live here peacefully.

Qiqi and Nunu did not wait for Chu Xiaoye to chase them away and took the initiative to sleep in the hole in front of them.

They realized that it was much cooler and more comfortable inside than outside.

Maya lay at the entrance of the cave and stared at them nervously. She only relaxed when she saw that they were okay inside.

Unfortunately, the hole was too small, or she would have entered it too.

The weather was too hot.

Chu Xiaoye brought the three little fellows and ambushed in the bushes for the night, but the tiger did not come.

After dawn.

The cold father and the three female lions returned dejectedly.

They returned empty-handed this time and did not catch anything.

At this moment, not only was the cold father looking at the live warthog in the camp with shining eyes, but the female lions were also drooling as they looked at it.

However, Little Curly Tail was guarding beside the warthog. He would glare fiercely at anyone who looked at the warthog. He even deliberately bared his fangs and looked fierce\!

He seemed to be provoking them. "Do you want to come over? Come on, I'll bite you to death\!"

Even his mother was threatened.

At this moment, the female lions suddenly felt that their pride had become more and more abnormal.

The lion king was not like a lion king, and the cubs were not like cubs.

The big ones became terrified, and the small ones became bolder.

Furthermore, each of the little ones was smarter and stronger than the other. Be it in battle or hunting, they seemed to be superior to adult lionesses like them. It was unbelievable and puzzled them.

The leader of the small ones was becoming more and more mysterious. There were many things he did that they did not understand.

However, when they looked at it later on, they all made sense.

For example, the food stored on the tree.

Why did they not think of storing food when they had plenty of food previously despite knowing that the dry season was approaching?

There was also water.

There was a severe drought everywhere, and even the river at the foot of the hill had dried up. He could actually get so much sweet and cold water, and he even wasted it to soak the bark. This made them think their lives were a lie.

Recently, that kid had raised this warthog absurdly and let it dig holes everywhere. He was really a wonder.

However, Maya's two children seemed to like that hole very much.

If they could all live in such holes, would it be much cooler?

Anyway, looking at what that kid did, they felt that their brains were becoming less and less useful. It was as if they were degenerating every day.

They were both lions, and they were adult lions. Why was the difference so great?

Although they coveted this warthog, to be honest, they did not dare to have a conflict with these cubs.

Don't they see Little Curly Tail baring his fangs and looking eager to fight?

They would not do as he wished\!

Therefore, after the sky turned dark, they set off with the cold father again to hunt in the distance.

The cold father was a little irritable and dejected.

In an ordinary pride, the cubs inside were all obedient and respected and feared their father. They did not dare to disobey at all.

Even so, Lion Kings would chase them away when they were two or three years old.

His pride really gave him a headache and frustration.

All of them rebelled and courted death in front of him every day, completely ignoring him, their king.

They were all a group of bastards\!

Therefore, he decided that no matter what, when the two boys were a year old, he would chase them out in advance.

Otherwise, how could he have the dignity of a king in the future?

It was embarrassing.

At that time, he would work with the female lions to chase them away\!

He did not believe that those two brats would still dare to bite their father and mother\!

Peace finally returned to the camp.

Qiqi and Nunu played and fought beside Maya for a while before crawling into the hole to sleep.

Chu Xiaoye brought Little Curly Tail and the others and continued to ambush in the bushes and trees.

As the leaves fell, the disguise on the surface of the trap looked even more realistic.

Would that terrifying enemy come tonight?
