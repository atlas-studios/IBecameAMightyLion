Chapter 372: Untitled

The sun soon rose.

When the little girl woke up, her side was already empty.

However, she vaguely remembered that she seemed to be sleeping with a warm body last night. The cold wind and air were also blocked outside by that body.

She slept very warmly and sweet.

The air was fresh.

The morning sun shone in through the dense leaves and mottled the ground. It shone brightly and jumped playfully, like happy little elves.

The little girl was also very happy.

She crawled out of the bushes, closed her eyes, and faced the sun. She breathed in the grassland air as if she was enjoying it, then walked towards the pride's camp.

The members of the pride were still busy.

Her bad king was still building that strange thing on the tree.

The little girl came under the tree and looked up for a while, preparing to help Mei Mei and the others pick the soft branches.

Her small hands were much more agile than their claws.

Just as she was about to leave, something suddenly fell from the tree and landed on her head.

The little girl raised her hand and took it down. She looked at it and saw that it was actually a piece of dried beef. It was as thin as a cicada's wings and revealed a transparent luster under the sun.

The little girl was stunned for a moment before she suddenly smelled a very special scent.

She hurriedly placed the beef slice under her nose and smelled it, her eyes revealing a hint of surprise. Coincidentally, her stomach was rumbling as she urged her to eat.

The little girl first stuck out her small pink tongue and licked it carefully. Her eyes immediately lit up. Then, she eagerly placed the beef slice in her mouth. She narrowed her eyes and slowly chewed, her little face filled with happiness.

This piece of beef was actually sweet\!

If it were in the past, she would naturally not be shocked. In the past, she could eat anything she wanted. Now, she had long forgotten the taste of those delicacies. As long as she was hungry, she would think of those raw meat with a strong smell of blood.

Therefore, this sweet beef was her most delicious and happiest food now.

After eating this piece of beef, her mouth was filled with sweetness. Her small face was filled with longing as she raised her head and looked at the tree.

Chu Xiaoye was still biting the branches and did not look at her.

She could not see the things hidden under the dense leaves, tall and strong branches.

However, the little girl already understood that the beef slices she prepared yesterday had not been eaten by this young king secretly.

She had been played.

Hmph\!

Bad king\!

Although she was not full, she was full of energy.

The little girl revealed a bright smile and her bright eyes were as bright as the sun.

She turned around and left, jumping around and humming a song as she went to help Mei Mei and Catherine pick the branches.

Chu Xiaoye looked down at her happy back and muttered in his heart. She was already in this state and could still be happy. Was she stupid or naive?

After another day of drying, the two gazelle pelts were finally dry.

The thin beef jerky that was mixed with the spices was also dried by the sun. At the same time, it also inhaled the smell of the spices.

Chu Xiaoye climbed up and chose a piece and sent it into his mouth. The numbing taste of green pepper and the spicy taste of wild chili mixed with the smell of the beef itself. Although it was missing some salt, it was much stronger than the bland taste previously.

However, he was a lion and did not like this smell.

The sun soon set.

After a busy day, everyone returned to the camp to rest.

The little girl stretched out her slender legs and sat under the tree. She leaned against the tree and wiped the sparkling sweat on her forehead. Her white dress was already dirty.

The lions could eat a meal every two to three days, because they would eat a lot every meal.

However, the little girl could not.

She rubbed her empty stomach and felt hungry.

Just as she was about to look up at the tree, two pieces of beef jerky suddenly fell from above and landed on the white dress between her legs.

The little girl was stunned for a moment. She looked up and saw Chu Xiaoye jumping onto another Baobab tree to see Tilly, who was still sleeping. He did not look at her.

The little girl lowered her head, picked up the two pieces of beef jerky on her dress, and sent them into her mouth.

This time, the smell of beef jerky suddenly became numb and spicy again. However, it was not too heavy and there was no stench. When he chewed, it was especially fragrant.

The little girl narrowed her eyes and ate one piece, then another.

The second slice turned sweet and spicy again, and the taste surprised her even more.

"Thank you, bad king."

The little girl looked up at the figure on the tree, her eyes filled with gratitude.

Although she was not full, two pieces were enough. She was very satisfied.

She felt a little tired. She stood up and prepared to rest.

The cold wind at night blew over and it was so cold that she shivered. The sweat and dirt on her body made her feel especially uncomfortable.

However, this was no longer her previous home. She was already very happy to be alive.

The little girl looked back at the figure on the tree, her blue eyes filled with longing. She muttered, "Bad king, you have to come and accompany Annie sooner."

She knew that he would come and sleep with her these few nights to give her warmth.

The temperature was very low and the night wind was very cold.

The little girl cowered and crawled into the bushes.

However, before she could lie down, Chu Xiaoye's fierce and rather ferocious lion head suddenly popped in and stared at her.

The little girl was stunned and blinked her beautiful big eyes. Then, she pounced on him and opened her arms to hug his neck. She said happily, "Time to sleep."

"Sleep my ass. Get up and party\!"

Chu Xiaoye swung his head and pushed her to the ground. Then, he crawled out and looked back at her, letting her follow.

The little girl lay on the ground and looked at him in confusion. Seeing that he seemed to be a little impatient, she immediately got up and crawled out of the bushes, her two little hands grabbing his tail.

At night, although there was bright moonlight, the little girl still could not see clearly and would be very afraid.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her impudent behavior and brought her into the depths of the bushes.

Soon, he stopped in front of a waterhole.

Due to the rain two days ago, this waterhole was already filled with rain and was extremely clear. The branches and leaves inside could be seen.

The moonlight was reflected inside and the breeze was wrinkled and sparkling.

Chu Xiaoye faced the water and admired his mighty and domineering appearance and mane. Then, he turned around and grinned at the little girl behind him. He raised his claws and pointed at the waterhole.

"Take a shower and sleep."

The little girl was stunned for a moment before she came in front of the waterhole. She opened her eyes wide and looked down at it. Then, she turned around and looked at him. Then, her fair face was dyed red.

"So the bad king despises me for being dirty."

Although it was very cold and the water would be very cold, the little girl did not hesitate and immediately started to take off her dress to wash her body.

However, her snow-white dress had already become dirty and she could not return to her former beauty.

When she started to take off her dress, Chu Xiaoye turned around and left.

Before long, Catherine walked over with a few green fruits that looked like flat beans in her mouth. After chewing them, she placed them by the waterhole and gestured for her to use them.

The little girl took off her dress and stood in the water, trembling. When she suddenly gritted her teeth and squatted down, soaking her entire body in the cold water, she suddenly felt a little warm and was not as cold as when she was on the shore previously.

"Thankâ¦ thank you."

The little girl only revealed her head on the water and said sweetly to Catherine.

Although she did not know what the green juice was, she could guess that this beautiful lioness cub wanted her to use it to wipe her body like bath lotion.

Then, she untied the two braids on her chest and soaked her hair in the water.

Just as she was about to wash up, Chu Xiaoye arrived slowly with her new clothes that still smelled like the sun.
