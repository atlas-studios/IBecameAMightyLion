Chapter 38: Life

He was scared to death\!

Luckily, none of the hyenas chased after him.

After entering the forest, Chu Xiaoye heaved a sigh of relief. He looked back with a lingering fear on his face.

That arrogant aura that was previously insufferable immediately seemed to deflate and turn into nothingness.

He started to run.

The hyenas thought that he had help, but he was actually alone.

When the other party reacted, they would definitely growl in anger.

Regardless, tonight went smoothly.

Tomorrow night, he would visit this enemy's territory again\!

A blood debt had to be paid with blood\!

He wanted to let them understand that the dignity and blood of lions were definitely not something a group of shameless dogs like them could trample on\!

It was still early.

He decided to catch another prey.

The storage room on the tree had already been built. They urgently needed to fill it with dried prey. Otherwise, they would not feel safe looking at it.

This forest was still lush and green.

However, the grassland had already turned yellow.

Over this period of time, there was not a single rainfall.

The river at the foot of the hill also slowed down and the water level started to drop.

Some large herbivores had already started to migrate.

All sorts of signs indicated that the dry season was approaching.

During the dry season on the grassland, not only was there a lack of food, the weather was also dry and there was less water. Even the rivers would dry up.

Many animals' lives might quietly end in this difficult season.

No matter how hard they worked, they could not resist nature.

The night was very quiet.

Chu Xiaoye was hiding in the bushes, waiting for his prey.

He was a lion.

Killing was only for survival.

Whether it was hunting prey or hunting enemies, it was all to better survive.

Of course, having been a human before, it was inevitable that he would have some human emotions.

Regardless of whether they were good or bad, regardless of whether these feelings would be rubbed away in the future when he struggled to survive, he was trying his best to integrate into this new "human" life.

"Whoosh\!"

The grass in front of him suddenly swayed.

Then, a thin wild rabbit popped out with its ears pricked. It looked around and walked in front of a berry.

Just as it lowered its head and was about to eat, Chu Xiaoye, who had been waiting for a long time, suddenly rushed out from the grass\!

At the same time\!

On the other side of the grass, there was also a figure that rushed out with almost the same speed and actions as him\!

The two figures suddenly paused and jumped in fright. They stood still and looked at each other with shock and vigilance.

"Whoosh\!"

The frightened wild rabbit immediately took this opportunity to jump into the grass and flee\!

"Roar\! Roar\!"

"It's you\! It's you again\!"

The little leopard that had rushed out from the bushes and was preparing to hunt bared its fangs at Chu Xiaoye and cried out angrily.

Chu Xiaoye looked at her. He was stunned at first, then shocked as he looked at the grass behind her.

Since the young female leopard was here, her mother was definitely here too\!

I better go.

After all, he had snatched their prey a few times previously and felt a little bad.

"Roarâ€”"

He pretended to be fierce and roared at the young female leopard, preparing to turn around and leave.

Unexpectedly, just as he roared, the aggressive young female leopard immediately shrank its neck, turned around, and ran\!

In the grass, the big female leopard stood up and looked at him with flickering eyes. She did not stop and immediately ran away with the little female leopard\!

The mother-daughter pair ran extremely quickly and did not stop for a moment\!

"..."

Chu Xiaoye stood rooted to the ground with a confused expression.

Was he that scary?

Or was his body already very strong and looked a little like an adult lion?

Leopards were indeed very timid.

Since they had left, this hunting ground still belonged to him.

He returned to the grass and continued to hide, waiting for his prey to arrive.

Half an hour later.

A female warthog walked into the forest with two young warthogs and started to eat the fruits on the ground happily.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment, but he did not hesitate at all. His gaze was fixed on the fat and healthy female warthog.

Although the warthog was not big, it ran extremely quickly. Two sharp fangs grew at the corner of its mouth, and it was not to be trifled with.

Their life force was extremely tenacious, especially in the dry season. Most animals were extremely weak from lack of water, but they lived freely. It was not a problem for them to not drink a drop of water for months.

Therefore, even though they had many natural enemies, their numbers were still considerable.

At this moment.

The two inexperienced little warthogs had already left the mother warthog's side and were walking towards the patch of grass Chu Xiaoye was hiding in.

The female warthog snorted and followed them.

However, it only took a few steps before it stopped in place. It raised its head and looked warily at the dense grass. It let out an anxious grunt, as if it was calling the two children back.

When warthog searched for food, they usually liked to eat in the open grassland. This was so that they could see further.

Even when entering the forest and eating, they would never approach those dense bushes that could not be seen clearly.

These two little warthogs clearly did not have any experience.

As for the female warthog, it looked much more careful.

Perhaps the two little warthogs were too happy eating their food. When they heard her shout, they did not immediately turn around and return. Instead, they walked even closer to the patch of grass Chu Xiaoye was hiding in.

The female warthog felt helpless and could only follow vigilantly, as if it wanted to personally inspect the grass.

Right at this moment, a figure suddenly jumped out of the grass with a whoosh and pounced on it\!

The female warthog let out a grunt and turned to run\!

The two little warthogs were frightened and ran in different directions in a panic\!

Chu Xiaoye did not chase after the two slower young warthogs. Instead, he chased after the mother warthog\!

His training during this period of time had made his muscles extremely developed. He could jump further and his running speed could even catch up to that of a leopard when hunting\!

"Whoosh\!"

He chased after it like lightning and jumped up, landing behind the female warthog. He extended his right claw and tripped its hind leg\!

The female warthog's body tilted and she fell to the ground, rolling miserably in the grass.

Before it could get up, Chu Xiaoye jumped up and bit its throat\!

The female warthog opened its mouth and let out a miserable roar.

The two little warthogs fled in panic, not knowing where they went. They did not know how they could survive after losing their mother.

Chu Xiaoye picked up the warthog and turned to leave.

In the world of animals, pity and mercy did not exist.

There was only one word: Survive.

After he left.

The leopard cub and daughter, each with a little warthog in their mouths, walked out of the forest beside him and stared blankly in the direction he had left in.

The buzzing of poisonous bees soon came from the bushes not far away.
