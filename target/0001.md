Chapter 1: Reborn as a Lion

Africa.

Kakivaro.

This was a boundless grassland, a paradise for wild animals.

Here, the most types and largest number of wild animals in the world lived.

Here, cruel and bloody battles happened every day.

At this moment.

In a certain area of the boundless grassland.

A pride of lions were resting under the shade of a tree.

The mighty and tall male lion went out to patrol its territory.

The full female lion laid on the ground to rest.

As for the seven or eight cubs, they were playing around and practising their fighting and hunting skills.

But.

There was a cub crawling in the bushes lifelessly. A hopeless expression appeared on its cute little face.

Chu Xiaoye did not die.

However, he turned into a cub.

He did not understand.

Why did his soul float to Africa and enter the body of a lion?

Although he liked watching "Animal World', it did not mean that he liked coming to this world.

This world was terrifying.

He had only been here for three days but had already witnessed a bloody massacre. Furthermore, he had almost lost his life\!

Five strong female lions worked together to kill an injured water buffalo.

The water buffaloes, on the other hand, charged over ferociously, scattering the lionesses and cubs. They attacked the fleeing cubs crazily.

He was only six months old.

If not for the fact that he had cleverly hidden in a tree hole, he would have been trampled flat by the huge hooves\!

However, in the end, the herd of cows left and the injured water buffalo became a feast for the lions.

Of course, he didn't eat it.

Instead, he was shivering in the tree hole.

He only dared to crawl out after a long time.

Meanwhile, his mother, whose mouth was full of blood after eating her prey, came over affectionately and licked him gently with her smelly tongue.

Then, she lay down again to feed him breast milk.

From the first day Chu Xiaoye turned into a lion, he swore in despair that he would go on a hunger strike and die\!

He didn't want to eat lion's breast milk and those bloody raw meat\!

But.

On the third day.

When the lioness laid in front of him lovingly and took the initiative to feed him the breast milk, he, who was famished, immediately started to suck in big mouthfuls of milk excitedly\!

"Nice\!"

He secretly exclaimed. He ate more vigorously than anyone else.

He survived.

He no longer wanted to starve or die.

Although he had become a lion, at least he was still alive, right?

At least he had a younger brother, a mother, a mighty and cool father, and a few cousins, right?

It was good to be alive.

However, after having his fill, he became melancholic again.

So…

While the other cubs were playing, he was hiding in the bushes in a daze, thinking about this stupid life as a lion.

There was a strange heat in his abdomen.

At times, it was quiet, and at other times, it was flowing. He had been farting and pooping for the past few days.

His farts were extremely smelly, and his younger brother, who was always by his side, always became dizzy from the smell and fled after he farted.

As for the poop, it was as black as ink. Even a fly would be afraid of it.

What illness was this?

He remembered that when his soul drifted across the sea and came to Africa, he was hit by a pearl that was shining with dazzling light.

And that pearl seemed to be embedded in his soul.

Could it be…

The strange heat in his stomach was produced by that pearl?

Roar\!

Just as he was feeling bored and letting his imagination run wild, a childish voice suddenly came from the side.

A cub with its tail curled up pounced on him.

This was his younger brother, Little Curly Tail.

His tail was different from that of others. The tip of his tail was always curled, so he gave him this name.

Little Curly Tail was very lively and bold.

Every day, he would jump around, provoking this and that.

Occasionally, he would even jump onto their imposing father's back and bite the majestic mane of the lion king.

His friends and the lionesses might spoil him.

But that imposing father would always bare his teeth and roar at him. He would even raise his huge claws to beat him up.

However, this cub never changed.

Of course, he loved playing with Chu Xiaoye—his brother.

In the past, his brother might have liked to play with him.

But now, his brother was always in a daze and did not care about him.

He did not know that his brother had changed.

Roar\!

Seeing that his brother was ignoring his, Little Curly Tail was still in high spirits and jumped on his brother's back.

Chu Xiaoye was starting to get impatient. He turned around and slapped him.

However, he missed.

Little Curly Tail dodged very quickly\!

Seeing that his brother had finally counterattacked, he was extremely excited and continued to pounce probingly.

"Go away\!"

Chu Xiaoye wanted to say this, but in the end, he only let out a "roar". His childish voice was not imposing at all.

Little Curly Tail bared his fangs and brandished his claws as he continued to attack.

His other friends also ran over excitedly and started provoking Chu Xiaoye, who was unwilling to get up.

They seemed to be saying, "Hey, kid, you're a future mighty lion. If you don't practice your combat skills now, are you going to be a bachelor in the future?"

When male lions grow up, they have to defeat other male lions and fight for territory to obtain the right to mate and food.

Of course Chu Xiaoye knew.

However, he was not in the mood for it right now.

Little Curly Tail happily hit him as if he wanted to arouse his lion's fighting spirit.

The other cubs were also practising all sorts of fighting techniques in front of them. It was as if they were trying to be teachers.

Chu Xiaoye got a headache from the noise. He stood up abruptly, opened his mouth wide, and roared at the group of little bastards.

In the end, no one bothered with him.

They didn't even hear it.

Little Curly Tail had a mocking expression on his face. He swung his tail and lowered his body, preparing to continue attacking.

Chu Xiaoye sighed and could only turn around. He cruelly aimed his butt at his younger brother and stuck out his tail. With a puff, he let out a smelly fart\!

This smelly fart actually carried an extremely terrifying black smoke\!

The black smoke instantly filled the surroundings\!

Little Curly Tail's expression changed. He was finally scared out of his wits. He turned around and ran while rolling and crawling\!

As for the other companions who were proudly showing off their combat skills, they did not have the time to run away. They were dizzy from the smell, and as if they were drunk, they staggered a few times and fell to the ground one after another, looking terrified and confused.

A female lion, who was lying nearby, saw that something was wrong and hurriedly got up and walked over.

In the end.

As soon as she got close, she stopped in her tracks and vomited everything she had just eaten\!

It was so smelly\!

This mother lion was probably cursing in her heart.

The culprit, Chu Xiaoye, had already walked far away and continued to lie in the bushes in a daze.

The sky was blue and the clouds were white.

On the grassland, the roar of a lion declaring its sovereignty could be heard.

What a boring day.
