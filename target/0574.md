Chapter 574: Daughter

It was dawn.

On Half Moon Mountain at the back of the Elf City, as the ancient and obscure language sounded, a dazzling light suddenly bloomed on Rosa's body.

The ancient altar that had experienced vicissitudes finally started to move.

Chu Xiaoye and Lanisi stood not far away and looked at the magical scene in front of them. They felt the strong fluctuation of strength and were extremely shocked.

Although he had experienced three lifetimes and seen countless strengths, this strength exceeded his understanding.

The further they walked and the more they saw, the more they felt that they were small.

No matter how strong a creature was, it could not withstand a single blow in the face of certain strength.

The ancient altar emitted a beautiful light and dense runes appeared on it, as if tadpoles were swimming on it.

Chu Xiaoye knew that he should go.

He brought Catherine down the mountain and prepared to go out to welcome his pride.

Lanisi, Fei'er, and the others sent him outside the city.

The ice bridge had been repaired, and even the snow forest outside had been repaired. Without the opening of the Elven Queen, no one outside could enter again.

Rosa had already inherited all the strength of the high priest, Senna. Furthermore, she was willing to stay here and serve Lanisi.

The current Elf City was really isolated from the world.

In the back mountain of the Elf City, there happened to be a grassland and forest that no one had ever stepped foot in. All sorts of animals lived there, and they would occasionally invade the flower fields and flowerbeds the elves planted to steal some food. No elves had ever hurt them.

They had long gotten along harmoniously.

Therefore, Lanisi hoped that Chu Xiaoye could stay here with his pride.

However, Chu Xiaoye did not agree immediately.

Although he was the king of the pride, he had to seek the opinion of the pride on this matter, and he had to go there to take a look first.

"Let's talk about it when we return."

Before leaving, Lanisi reminded her again and again, but Chu Xiaoye still did not give her a clear answer.

Lanisi was anxious. She pulled his hand and said, "Night, do you not want to return? Or do you dislike that place being small?"

Chu Xiaoye could only say, "Let's talk about it after I see it. Lanisi, I'll definitely return. Don't worry."

Lanisi still held his hand tightly and looked at him affectionately. "Night, if you don't return, I'll definitely find you. Remember Senna's words, don't force yourself. This is your home."

"Home?"

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment. He raised his head and looked at the majestic Elf City.

It did not feel like home here.

His home was always on the grassland.

"Night, I'm pregnant."

Lanisi suddenly said.

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled and his expression was stiff. He looked at her in shock.

"Impossible\!"

They had returned three days ago and were still lingering last night. They knew that he was leaving today. This Elven Queen had done all she could to serve him, so how could she be pregnant?

"I checked it this morning."

Lanisi's face was red as she looked at the expression on his face nervously. "Are you… not happy?"

Fei'er, who was eavesdropping not far away, immediately walked over and said angrily, "Lord Night, I accompanied Her Majesty to check this morning. Her Majesty is indeed pregnant. If Lord Night doesn't admit it, Fei'er will never allow it\!"

Chu Xiaoye stayed in place, his mind in chaos.

Pregnant?

Then, was the Elven Queen pregnant with an elf? Or…

Just the thought of it made his blood run cold.

Damn it\!

He wished he could slap himself a few times. Why did he only care about feeling comfortable every time but not think of good safety measures?

He did not think in this direction at all\!

"You're not happy."

Lanisi's eyes turned red as she said faintly.

Chu Xiaoye woke up and hurriedly held her hand tightly. "I'm happy, why would I be unhappy? Of course I'm happy. However, I have to take it slow. This is a little too sudden. You should tell me slowly. You know that I was not an elf previously…"

Lanisi immediately said, "Night, don't worry. I've asked Rosa. What I'm pregnant with is definitely an elf. Furthermore, it's a little girl."

Chu Xiaoye: "???"

She knew whether it was a boy or girl just after she got pregnant? Was that high priest more powerful than an ultrasound?

Alright, thinking of the magical scene on the altar just now, he had to admit that the high priest was indeed powerful.

"A little girl?"

A small figure immediately appeared in Chu Xiaoye's mind. She was wearing a princess dress and had sharp little ears. She was beautiful and cute and had golden or red hair. She opened her arms and ran towards him, calling out sweetly, "Daddy\! Daddy\! Mommy said that you're Little Xi. I want to ride Little Xi."

Ah, his heart was about to melt.

Chu Xiaoye covered his heart, feeling excited and sweet. He hugged the Elven Queen and kissed her red lips. He said with tears in his eyes, "Lanisi, I will definitely return\! I have to watch my daughter be born and grow up with her\! That's my little princess, my little cotton-padded jacket\!"

Lanisi said sweetly, "Yes, we'll wait for you."

Chu Xiaoye let go of her and looked at Fei'er, who was at the side, as well as Vilis, Denise, Annie, and Doya not far away. He said, "Help me take care of the Queen and wait for me to return. My dear girls, please\!"

With that said, he turned around and left, not wanting these girls to see the tears and fragile side of him.

He could not bear to do so.

He finally had something to worry about and a new home.

However, he had to bring back the home on the grassland.

The night passed and the morning sun appeared.

The canyon lit up. The canyon that had once been burned and destroyed by the raging flames was now full of life and green.

He believed that before long, grass would be lush and flowers would fill this place again.

The beautiful Elf City would be reborn in the morning sun.

Another life would also be born in the anticipation of everyone.

He suddenly stopped and shouted behind him, "Fei'er, come and pick up the clothes\!"

He turned into a lion and strode away with Catherine facing the morning sun.

Fei'er ran over, her pink hair flying in the morning wind. She shouted at him, "Lord Night, Fei'er will wait for you in the snow forest every day\! If you don't return, Fei'er will turn into an ice sculpture and wait there forever\!"

Chu Xiaoye was touched. He wiped his tears and could not help but turn around and shout, "Fei'er, I'll definitely return\! When I return, I'll make you pregnant\!"

Fei'er:"…"

Chu Xiaoye brought Catherine out of the canyon, the ice bridge, and the snow forest.

This time, they walked out easily and saw the water curtain-like light screen.

A door opened there.

Chu Xiaoye composed himself and immediately walked out with Catherine.

A familiar aura assaulted him.

However, it seemed to have changed again.

The sky was dark, the ground was cracked, and the grassland was withered. It seemed to have not rained for a long time, and there was a gloomy scene everywhere.

Chu Xiaoye's heart sank and he ran.
