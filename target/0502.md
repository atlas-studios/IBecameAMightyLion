Chapter 502: The Battle Between the Lion King and the Queen

Annie wanted to beg for mercy.

However, she knew that she was not qualified.

Furthermore, she was in a shocked and confused state.

The true Princess Annie did not betray the elves. Instead, she sacrificed heroically in the snow forest outside and in the battle with the orcs.

Then, why did they summon her here?

Everything he said to her previously was a lie.

She suddenly gathered her courage and begged the Elven Princess who had just become a new queen in front of her, "Your Majesty, can you let us go? I promise that I will never bring them into the Elven Kingdom again."

Lanisi turned her head to look at her, but her blue eyes became gentle.

"Annie, this is your home."

She said softly, like an older sister comforting her younger sister.

Annie looked at her in a daze, not understanding.

Beside her, Vilis grabbed her little hand and said softly, "Princess, Princess Annie's body has left, but her soul, memories, spirit, and faith are still here and have entered your body. You are Princess Annie, the true Princess Annie."

Annie was even more confused. She said with a trembling voice, "But… but I don't have her memories at all…"

"You will have her memories, my sister."

Lanisi revealed a rare gentle smile and reached out to stroke her head.

Annie lowered her head and begged in a low voice, "Then, Your Majesty, can you spare the night? He's my friend, my family, and my benefactor. Please."

Lanisi retracted her hand and looked at Chu Xiaoye, who was on the stone table again. She was silent for a while before saying slowly, "In the human countries, there is a rule. If you are sentenced to death, you can use a duel to reduce your sentence and let the god they believe in decide your life and death. If you win, the death sentence will be exempted. Now, I can give you a chance."

"Do you dare?"

Lanisi raised the sword in her hand, meaning that she would be the one fighting.

Annie's gaze returned to normal.

She believed in her king.

Vilis' lips moved, as if she wanted to remind her friend and queen, but she ultimately did not speak.

"You will regret it."

Chu Xiaoye, who was standing on the stone table, grinned and said this.

Lanisi smiled.

She inserted the sword into the sheath and suddenly jumped over the railing in front of her, jumping down from a height of dozens of meters.

Everyone let out cries of surprise.

The fiery red pterodactyl roared and rushed over from under her. It caught her steadily and swooped down.

When she was about to reach the ground, Lanisi's red hair fluttered as he jumped down and landed lightly like a butterfly.

The pterodactyl turned around and rushed into the sky again.

"Long live the Queen\!"

Everyone shouted in unison, their eyes filled with admiration and excitement.

This was their queen\!

Then, they looked at the stone house.

Clearly, the bald lion could only walk down the corridor step by step and then go down the stairs.

"Are you being cool?"

Chu Xiaoye muttered before jumping off the stone table and jumping out of the stone house, landing from the sky.

"Ah\!"

This time, everyone was really shocked.

Was this because he knew that he would lose in a battle and wanted to kill himself for his dignity?

Annie's expression changed. She hurriedly ran in front of the railing and looked down.

Vilis was also shocked.

She did not want this lion that she had long treated as a mount to die.

Only Catherine remained calm.

Lanisi raised her head and looked up, her eyes filled with surprise.

Baldy's body landed vertically. He did not have wings and could not fly. No pterodactyls or birds came to pick him up.

Was he really killing himself?

"Pfft—"

A strange sound suddenly came from behind the bald lion.

Then, he immediately slowed down.

In the end, it became slower and slower, as if it was floating in midair.

Then, he gently landed on the ground and squatted there.

On the ground where he was squatting, the green grass was already black. The lush grass had withered and died for some reason.

The elven nobles and all the spectators were dumbfounded.

Lanisi was stunned for a few seconds. With a bang, she pulled out the sword at her waist and said in high spirits, "You only have one chance."

Chu Xiaoye said, "If I didn't hear wrongly, there are some loopholes in the rule you mentioned. If I win, I can only be exempted from the death sentence and have other punishments, right?"

Lanisi nodded and said, "Yes."

Chu Xiaoye tilted his head and said, "Then, I refuse to fight."

Lanisi stabbed the sword in her hand into the ground and looked at him with a burning gaze. "Do you think you have the right to choose? If you refuse to fight, there's only death to choose from."

"I can still escape."

Chu Xiaoye raised his head and looked at the elven nobles on it. "Before I escape, I will kill many of your subordinates and friends, even if I only kill a few. Of course, I can't escape, but you elven nobles will also suffer casualties. For an elven race with only a thousand people left, even one death, as the queen, your heart will ache, right?"

Lanisi fell silent.

After a moment, she narrowed her eyes and said, "Are you threatening me?"

Chu Xiaoye shook his head and said, "No. I'm only threatening you."

Lanisi gripped the hilt of her sword tightly, her gaze as cold as a sword. Even the winged dragon that was wandering in the sky seemed to sense her anger and let out an ear-piercing cry in the clouds.

"What do you want?"

This new queen who had just ascended the throne finally spoke.

Chu Xiaoye said, "It's very simple. If I win, I'll be free and all my sins and punishments will be gone."

"Whoosh\!"

Lanisi pulled out the sword on the ground, her red hair flying. Almost without thinking, she said with a cold expression, "Alright\! However, this time, I will definitely not show mercy\!"

She held the sword and moved her long legs, charging over like the wind.

"Long live the Queen\! Cut off the head of that bald lion\!"

On the stands, everyone raised their arms and shouted.

"Pfft—"

With an explosion, black fog surged into the sky\!

Lanisi's sprint suddenly stopped. She knelt on the ground and started to vomit.

Thick black fog surrounded her and she could not see anything.

Chu Xiaoye walked in front of her, turned around, and curled his tail. He sprayed an even more terrifying airflow at her beautiful face\!

Lanisi flew out and the sword in her hand left her palm and flew out.

When she fell to the ground in a sorry state, Chu Xiaoye was already waiting for her.

The sharp golden claw was pressed against her throat.

She had lost and was still vomiting.

The stands were silent.
