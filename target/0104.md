Chapter 104: The King Strikes\!

Under the moonlight.

The cold father turned around and looked at the lioness cub that was kicked to the ground but did not have any temper.

Then, he looked at his son.

Just as he was thinking about banishing his son in the future, the lioness cub suddenly looked over coldly.

The cold father yawned and turned around to look at the distant grassland with an expression of contemplation.

This grassland was so big.

Chu Xiaoye endured the pain and continued to aim his butt at Catherine. He raised his hind leg that was shot and bared his fangs at her.

He seemed to be saying, "Little fool, quickly pluck it out\!"

Catherine finally understood.

She hurriedly got up from the ground and came close. However, she looked at the sharp arrow that was inserted into his flesh and could not bear to pull it out.

Chu Xiaoye's two front feet were in pain. He could only kneel on the ground, raise his butt, and close his eyes nervously.

Catherine hesitated for a moment and looked at him deeply. Then, she lowered her head, opened her mouth, and bit the arrow shaft.

Chu Xiaoye's muscles were tense and he was trembling slightly.

He gritted his teeth\!

"Chi\!"

Catherine closed her eyes and suddenly pulled\!

Blood and flesh splashed out and landed on her face.

Chu Xiaoye's entire body trembled and he fell to the ground. His hind legs trembled non-stop, but he gritted his teeth and did not make a sound.

Catherine's face was covered in blood as she spat out the arrow in her mouth. Her heart ached as she went in front of his thigh and licked the wound.

This time, Chu Xiaoye did not kick her.

He was trembling in pain and had no strength left.

He lay on the ground, lowered his head, and closed his eyes.

He really wanted to sleep.

However, he could not sleep yet.

"Roar—"

He suddenly called out and woke Little Curly Tail and Mei Mei up.

It was not safe here.

They had to return to the pride's camp to heal slowly.

There was water, food, and the protection of a pride.

Seeing that he was awake, Little Curly Tail was extremely excited and rubbed his body happily.

Mei Mei also stood up excitedly and ran behind him. She wanted to lick him, but he glared at her and she could only give up in disappointment.

Catherine, who had already retreated, felt even more happy and sweet when she saw this scene.

Indeed, only I, Catherine, can be lucky enough to lick Brother Ye\!

It was not easy to return to the camp.

Chu Xiaoye and Little Curly Tail's legs were injured and they could not walk.

Therefore, they had to let the two female cubs carry them.

As for the cold father, there was no need to think. With the king's arrogance and cold personality, he definitely would not lower himself to do such a thing.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and let Catherine come over.

This female cub was very strong. There would definitely be no problem carrying Little Curly Tail.

As for him, if he endured the pain, he could still barely support himself on the ground to reduce his weight. Therefore, he could just let Mei Mei carry him.

Catherine quickly came in front of him. Before he could gesture, she immediately turned around and lay in front of him, trembling in excitement.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out and gestured for her to lie in front of Little Curly Tail and carry him.

Catherine was stunned for a moment before she turned around and looked at him in a daze. She was extremely sad.

She did not want to carry Little Curly Tail\!

Seeing that she was dawdling, Chu Xiaoye immediately bared his fangs and roared at her.

Catherine stood up sadly, lowered her head, and lay down in front of Little Curly Tail.

Chu Xiaoye gestured for Little Curly Tail to go up quickly.

Little Curly Tail endured the pain and climbed onto Catherine's back.

Just as Chu Xiaoye was about to let Mei Mei lie down, Catherine suddenly stood up with Little Curly Tail on her back. Then, she fell to the ground with a bang.

She struggled a few times but could not stand up.

It looked like she could not move Little Curly Tail.

Little Curly Tail's two front legs were already in pain. After being shaken by her a few times, the pain became even more intense. He hurriedly climbed down from her body and did not dare to go up again.

"Roar\!"

He called out to his brother a few times, looking very wronged.

Catherine stood up and took a few steps. Her body swayed and her limbs looked like they were jelly.

Could it be that she had exhausted too much energy fighting the hyenas previously?

Or was she injured?

That must be it.

Chu Xiaoye could only let Mei Mei go over and carry Little Curly Tail.

As for him, he decided to endure the pain and walk back slowly by himself.

Mei Mei obediently walked in front of Little Curly Tail and lay down.

Little Curly Tail usually liked to bully her, but his relationship with her was still very good. She had just saved him at a critical moment.

Hence, Little Curly Tail was exceptionally grateful to her.

Little Curly Tail rubbed his head against her body and climbed up.

Mei Mei stood up with difficulty and walked a few steps. She looked like she could persist in carrying him back.

"Roar\!"

Chu Xiaoye called out and announced the departure.

However, at this moment, Catherine lowered her head and walked in front of him. She turned around and lay down.

Chu Xiaoye was stunned for a moment and looked at her strangely.

Little Curly Tail, who was lying on Mei Mei's back, hurriedly called out, as if he was saying, "Brother, be careful, don't go up\! This female cub will hurt you\!"

Catherine hung her head tightly and crawled forward. She took a few steps back and took the initiative to crawl between Chu Xiaoye's legs.

Chu Xiaoye hesitated for a moment and could not refuse. He could only climb onto her back. However, he was very careful and his muscles were tense, preparing to land at any time.

However, this female cub that had just looked exhausted and weak suddenly stood up and walked quickly towards the bushes in front of her\!

It looked like she could lift weights easily and was full of energy\!

Little Curly Tail widened his eyes in shock.

Could he be heavier than his brother?

Mei Mei carried him with all her might and followed him.

Seeing that they had gone far, the cold father yawned and stood up. He followed behind slowly as if he was taking a walk.

Catherine walked with ease and felt like she was about to fly.

However, when she was about to approach the pride's camp, she suddenly slowed down and pretended that she could not move.

When Chu Xiaoye wanted to come down, she suddenly accelerated.

When Chu Xiaoye stopped moving, she immediately slowed down.

After a few times, Chu Xiaoye was puzzled. He could only lie on her back obediently and was too lazy to move.

When they passed by the orchard, Chu Xiaoye could not help but look up, but he did not see the figure of the little leopard.

He hoped that the injury that time did not cost them their lives.

Suddenly, two dark and cold gazes shot out from the bushes not far away\!

Chu Xiaoye looked over and saw a huge figure covered in black and yellow stripes standing there.

Although he was blocked by the bushes and could not see the complete outline, the size and aura that was revealed was not inferior to that of an adult lion\!

Chu Xiaoye's heart trembled. Just as he was about to observe carefully, the figure suddenly turned around and crawled into the bushes at the back, disappearing.

However, the thick tail that was revealed made Chu Xiaoye even more shocked.

That seemed to be…

Could he be seeing things?
