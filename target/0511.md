Chapter 511: Lady Vilis' Cry

When you were the center of attention, you were destined to have no privacy.

Chu Xiaoye was helpless. He could only turn into a lion and pee in front of everyone.

Although this was also very embarrassing. After all, so many women were looking straight at him, at least lions did not blush.

When he peed, not only was Denise protecting him, she also helped him pick up the clothes and sword that had fallen to the ground.

However, why was this elven girl facing him?

"Denise, I think you should turn around."

Chu Xiaoye could not help but remind her.

Denise hesitated for a moment before slowly turning her back. However, she took a few steps back and retreated behind him, still facing him and looking at him with her eyes wide.

The muscles on Chu Xiaoye's face twitched and he could not help but say, "Are you stupid? Do you know what I'm saying?"

Lanisi smiled not far away and said, "Night, don't blame her. Denise is protecting you. If you're not in her vision, she won't be able to help you deal with the danger immediately."

"Whoosh\!"

Right at this moment, an arrow tore through the air\!

Denise swung the sword in her hand and slapped the arrow in front of Chu Xiaoye.

If he was a step late, this arrow might penetrate his body.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw that the orcs had gathered their team again and walked up the bridge with their shields. A few of the orcs were especially tall and the bows in their hands could be called giant bows. Their range was extremely far and they were 200 meters away.

His expression changed. He did not dare to dwell on these small matters and immediately ran behind the rock to hide.

Denise followed and placed the clothes beside him.

Chu Xiaoye saw that the elven girls around him were all staring at him and could not help but be a little anxious. "If you all look at me eagerly, I can't change into clothes\! In my current form, how can I give you orders?"

"Cough, cough\!"

Queen Lanisi coughed and made everyone look away.

Beside him, Vilis snorted coldly and muttered, "Do you really think your body is beautiful? Who cares\!"

Chu Xiaoye immediately retorted, "The more you say you don't care, the more you care\! Lady Vilis, everyone turned their heads away from you. Why are you still opening your eyes and staring at me?"

"Pui\!"

Vilis immediately turned her head and looked elsewhere.

Chu Xiaoye immediately returned to being an elf and quickly put on his clothes.

Denise handed him the sword.

At this moment, he realized that the elf girl had been looking at him.

However, now was not the time to be bothered about these things. The orc army on the bridge had already crossed the 200-meter distance.

This time, the vanguard sent out by the orc army was all tall and extremely strong orcs. Some held shields, and some held bows. At their waists, there was a strong rope tied tightly to them, linking them all together.

They seemed to want to use this method to resist the terrifying attack of the crossbow.

The orcs at the front had fearless expressions. Clearly, they had already been treated as cannon fodder and used their bodies and lives to create conditions for their companions behind them to continue forward.

"Fire\!"

Chu Xiaoye made a prompt decision and did not give them a chance to continue forward.

At a distance of 200 meters, the arrows on the ballistae could be easily shot out and displayed great might. Only a few archers could shoot the orcs' arrows, and their penetration was greatly reduced.

However, if they were to continue forward, the huge bows in their archers' hands would become very terrifying.

"Whoosh\!"

"Whoosh\! Whoosh\! Whoosh\!"

Four ballistae started to fire iron arrows one after another.

The row of orcs at the front was immediately pierced through by the iron arrow and pierced through their bodies, flying back.

The orcs standing behind them seemed to have expected it. They immediately squatted down and used their shields to block the front.

However, the penetration power of those iron arrows was too terrifying and strong. They still fell three rows.

However, these strong orcs were extremely strong. Even if they fell to the ground, they raised their shields and would rather die to continue blocking the flying iron arrows.

The orcs behind transported more shields and stacked them layer by layer. They leaned against each other and placed their shoulders against each other as they started to squat forward.

When the terrifying iron arrows flew again and pierced through the shields and orcs at the front, the orcs at the front did not fall immediately. Instead, they were pushed forward by the orcs behind them with their shields.

Finally, the strong orcs gradually blocked the attack of the crossbow with their corpses and strength.

Batches of orcs fell in front of them, but they were getting closer and closer to the cliff on the elves' side.

As they got closer, the penetration and strength of the iron arrow increased.

The orcs seemed to have ignored life and death. With their shields and corpses, they roared and continued forward.

Soon, the corpses were piled on the bridge. They also carried their shields and advanced to a hundred meters away from the opposite cliff.

"The arrows are almost gone."

At this moment, Denise, who was squatting behind Chu Xiaoye, suddenly said.

Queen Lanisi turned around and looked at her, then at Chu Xiaoye beside her, her eyes showing anxiety.

If there were still hundreds of such iron arrows, the orcs on the bridge would never think of coming over. Even if they came over with corpses without fear of death, they would suffer heavy casualties and would definitely lose.

However, she knew that it was already very good to be able to make these four car crossbows and these iron arrows in such a short time.

The orcs had at least two thousand casualties now.

She should be satisfied.

However, this battle concerned the survival of the entire elven race. How could she be satisfied with just 2,000 people and so many orcs?

The Queen regretted not letting Annie return earlier and knowing the young man beside her earlier.

The four ballistae suddenly stopped shooting.

All the iron arrows had been used up.

The orc army on the bridge was still advancing with shields and corpses.

"Now, what should we do?"

At this moment, all the elves looked at the young elf.

Chu Xiaoye squatted behind the rock and looked at the orc on the bridge without moving, not showing any expression.

Hence, everyone could only wait patiently.

Suddenly, Chu Xiaoye shouted at the crossbow, "Fire\!"

"Boom\!"

The four crossbows that had worked hard for the elves instantly ignited with flames.

He had not told the Queen and the others about this decision previously.

Therefore, at this moment, when she saw the four ballistae suddenly burn, Lanisi was shocked.

Vilis said angrily, "Are you crazy?"

They had worked hard to build those four car crossbows. They were even more powerful than the sword in her hand. How could they burn them just like that?

Denise looked at the burning crossbow, her eyes reflecting the jumping flames.

Her heart ached, but she knew that those carbines and crossbows had to be burned.

Princess Annie whispered, "The crossbow is too heavy. At this time, we can't push it away. The orcs are already very close and can see this place clearly. If they remember the appearance of the crossbow, it will be a disaster for us elves."

Vilis fell silent and stopped talking.

Lanisi nodded and said, "What should we do next?"

She looked at the elf youth beside her.

"Wait."

Chu Xiaoye only said one word.

Hence, everyone waited patiently until the orcs on the bridge realized that they no longer had iron arrows. They started to roar and provoke them, starting to build the bridge.

Until the bridge was filled with Orcs again.

At this moment, the bridge was only dozens of meters away from the cliff here.

The orc army gathered on the bridge and was already preparing to jump and charge, taking revenge for their companions.

The elves hiding behind the rocks at the edge of the cliff tightened their grip on their weapons and started to feel nervous and uneasy.

There were too many beasts and they were too strong.

They looked at the youth again and waited for his orders.

Should they guard the bridge to the death and fight the orcs to the end?

Vilis had already pulled out her sword and stared intently at the cliff, preparing to rush up and kill it happily.

Chu Xiaoye did not tell them any plans in advance.

This battle concerned his life. He would not trust anyone. Who knew that there were no orc spies in the elves?

"Roar—"

The orcs' roars were like thunder, becoming even louder and more excited.

"Little elves\! Die\!"

They were even closer\!

Chu Xiaoye suddenly raised his head and shouted behind the rock near the cliff, "Ba Mo, attack\!"

The elf guard who was stationed here all year round suddenly pulled out his sword and started to hack fiercely at the thick rope on the huge winch beside him.

"Bam\!"

The sound of ropes breaking could be heard. Even among the orcs' roars, it was exceptionally clear.

"Squeak…"

The half of the ice bridge suspended in midair suddenly let out an ear-piercing creak. Then, it suddenly trembled and started to fall forward. Its speed was not too fast, but it scared the orcs on the bridge out of their wits\!

"Ah —"

"Run\! Run\!"

At this moment, they finally reacted\!

However, it was already too late\!

The bridge was crowded and filled with orcs who were preparing to charge and kill. How could they run for a moment?

"Boom\!"

A loud bang\!

The fallen ice bridge smashed heavily onto the bridge that the orcs had just built\!

Most of the orcs on the bridge were instantly smashed to death. Before the remaining ones could stand up, they fell into the bottomless abyss with the broken bridge\!

"Ah —"

Terrified and desperate cries resounded throughout the entire abyss\!

The orcs who were roaring angrily and excited just a moment ago had their souls broken off the cliff the next moment\!

The remaining orc troops at the opposite cliff were terrified when they saw this scene and let out trembling cries.

This time, they lost nearly two thousand people.

What made them feel even more desperate was that the bridges that they had painstakingly repaired were all destroyed in an instant\!

They had made a fatal mistake: they were too stupid and confident. They never would have thought that the pure and noble elves would use such a scheme.

The cliff quickly quietened down.

The elves were also shocked into silence.

For a long time, no one spoke.

Until Chu Xiaoye stood up and exercised his muscles. The most enthusiastic, excited, and grateful cries suddenly sounded around him. "Long live the Queen\! Long live Lord Night\!"

The cries did not stop and became louder and louder.

They had originally been determined to die, but now, they suddenly saw hope.

All of this was brought about by this youth.

They sincerely hoped that this youth could protect them forever like their queen.

"Lord Night, marry our queen\!"

Someone suddenly jeered. It was a childish and sweet voice.

Chu Xiaoye turned around and saw an elf girl holding a bow.

Her pure and clear eyes were filled with sincere gratitude and request, as if this request was the only thing that could calm her little heart.

"That's right, Lord Night\! You're so powerful and handsome. Marry our queen\! As long as you're here, we'll definitely defeat the orcs and save our companions one day. Please\!"

Another archer girl pleaded.

Hence, more voices sounded, begging Chu Xiaoye to stay in the elf city and marry their queen.

Their thoughts were very simple. They did not need to be noble, have strong combat strength, or have any wealth. They only needed to give them a sense of security and let them live here well.

"Handsome?"

At this moment, a discordant voice suddenly sounded and mocked, "I think he's short, right?"

The huge sword lolita had a black face and was very unhappy.

Princess Annie smiled and said, "A small body can also project a huge shadow. The current Night is tall and not short in the hearts of every elf."

"The princess is right\! Lord Night is as tall as the queen and Lady Denise in my heart\!"

The little elf girl who was the first to jeer laughed and shouted.

She was considered Denise's disciple and the bow in her hand was personally made by Denise. Her respect for Denise was not inferior to that of the queen.

To be able to put Chu Xiaoye with her queen and Lady Denise, it could be seen how important this young elf was in her heart.

The others hurriedly said loudly, "Lord Night is definitely not small in our hearts\!"

Vilis suddenly said angrily, "He's a lion\!"

She was not targeting Chu Xiaoye. Towards this battle, she was utterly convinced and grateful to this young elf.

However, this did not mean that she would agree with the Queen's grievance.

"He has indeed done something for us elves. We can give him anything he wants, but that does not include the queen."

The huge sword loli said without giving in.

At this moment, Princess Annie suddenly said faintly, "Vilis, I think you should ask your queen first."

Vilis was stunned and looked at her queen.

Lanisi's eyes were bright and beautiful like the stars. She did not blush, be shy, or be angry. There was even a smile on her face, and her mood was not affected by this matter.

She was in a good mood.

She blinked playfully at the youth beside her and said, "Perhaps, you should ask our Lord Night's opinion first."

Hence, everyone looked at the young elf.

Including Catherine, who had been standing silently behind him.

Under the expectant gazes of everyone, Chu Xiaoye suddenly grabbed the skirt of the huge sword loli and said loudly, "Lady Vilis\! As the noblest swordmaster and knight of the elves, please fulfill your promise\! According to our bet, you should lie on the ground and let me ride you once\!"

Then, he looked at Queen Lanisi and said, "Your Majesty, please testify and make decisions for me."

Lanisi smiled and said, "Of course. You won this bet and Vilis lost. I believe that with Vilis's identity, she will never break the agreement."

Their conversation successfully diverted everyone's attention to the pitiful giant sword loli.

Princess Annie sighed faintly.

She knew that a certain fellow still had the blue sky and grassland in his heart. He wanted his companions under the giant tree to marry the queen, settle down in the elves, and protect the elves for life. It was not the freedom he wanted.

Vilis' skirt was grabbed and she was embarrassed in front of everyone. She was embarrassed and angry and punched Chu Xiaoye in the eye, but Chu Xiaoye, who was already prepared, dodged it.

"Yo\! You're angry from embarrassment\! Look\! Everyone, look\! Your Great Swordmaster, your honorable and proud Lady Vilis, not only did you not keep your promise, you even want to beat me up\! How dare you\!"

Chu Xiaoye shouted loudly for everyone to reason with him.

Vilis was ashamed. She clenched her fists and did not dare to attack again. She stomped her feet and said, "Let go\! I… I admit defeat\!"

Chu Xiaoye let go and said with a smile, "Then lie down. I've just squatted for a long time and my back is aching from exhaustion. If I can ride on Lady Vilis and rest for a while, I'll definitely be full of energy and feel good."

Vilis was angry and anxious. Her eyes were filled with tears as she looked pitifully at the Queen and Princess Annie, hoping to seek help.

However, the two of them expressed their helplessness.

As noble elves and conferred knights, they had to keep their promises.

"Lady Vilis, just lie down and let Lord Night ride you. Although it's a little unfair, Lord Night did win. Furthermore, he saved our entire elven race. If possible, we're willing to be ridden by Lord Night in your place."

At this moment, an elf girl persuaded her, then looked at the elf youth in admiration.

"That's right, Lady Vilis. Take it as helping us thank and reward Lord Night for his hard work. Please."

"Lady Vilis, please\!"

Hence, everyone started to persuade and beg.

Vilis felt even more embarrassed and did not dare to hesitate anymore. She immediately put down the sword on her shoulder, bent down, and knelt on the ground. Her upper body also climbed down, and she raised her butt. She placed her hands on the ground and said with tears in her eyes, "I, Vilis, will keep my word. It's just being ridden a little. It's nothing. Go on, I won't move."

With that, she cried out.

Chu Xiaoye deliberately said, "Lady Vilis, it's not comfortable for me to ride like this. Why don't I turn into a lion and ride again?"

"Wow—"

The huge sword loli cried even louder.

"Hahaha…"

Chu Xiaoye could not help but laugh out loud. He walked forward, bent down, and gently hugged her slender waist. Then, he got up and said, "Alright, I'm done riding."

If he turned into a lion, he would have indeed finished riding it.

Vilis' cries stopped abruptly. She turned her head and looked at him with tears in her eyes and a stunned expression.

Chu Xiaoye ignored her and held his sword. He waved his hand and said, "All the archers, follow me. Let's go to a fun place."

The orcs would definitely not let the matter rest after suffering such a defeat.

He had just looked opposite when the orc army started to cut down trees again. Furthermore, they were divided into three groups and gathered at the cliff.

Obviously, the other party was preparing to build three bridges and charge over together, making them unable to defend.

Even if they created more ballistae and iron arrows, there would not be many of them in a short time. They would not be able to defend against three armies at the same time.

Therefore, Chu Xiaoye decided to give up here and catch a turtle in a jar to bury them completely\!

Denise brought all the archers and followed him up the hill.

Vilis stood up from the ground and wiped her tears, seemingly still unable to react. Had this fellow really finished riding? How could he be so fast?

Could it be because he was a lion?

Lanisi looked at the figure on the hill with a bright gaze and could not help but smile.
